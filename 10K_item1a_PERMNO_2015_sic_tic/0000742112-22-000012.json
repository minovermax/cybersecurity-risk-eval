Risk Factors.\nThe company's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties. One should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the company's other filings with the SEC, before making any investment decision with respect to the company's securities. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones the company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known by the company or that the company currently deems immaterial may also affect the company's business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties occur, develop or worsen, the company's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could change substantially.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nAs noted above, the company is subject to a number of risks that if realized could materially harm its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Some of the more significant risks and uncertainties the company faces include those summarized below. The summary below is not exhaustive and is qualified by reference to the full set of risk factors set forth in this \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d section.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, the company\u2019s operations and could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business, financial condition and liquidity, including the ability for end users to gain access to the company's products.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to a persistent global shipping and logistics crisis, including shortages in the availability of, and increasing costs for, container shipping and has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, the company\u2019s ability to obtain critical products, components and raw materials which could have a material, adverse effect on the company\u2019s business, financial condition and liquidity.\nCommercial and Operational Risks\n\u2022If the company's business improvement efforts are ineffective, the company's strategic goals, business plans, financial performance or liquidity could be negatively impacted.\n\u2022If the company is unable to attract and retain critical IT Governance, Project Management and Contract Management competencies, it may limit the effectiveness of the company's cost improvement and business efficiency initiatives and adversely affect the company's profitability and growth.\n\u2022Changes in government and other third-party payor reimbursement levels and practices have negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact the company's revenues and profitability.\n\u2022If the company's products are not included within an adequate number of customer formularies, or if pricing policies otherwise favor competitors' products, the company's market share and gross margin could be negatively affected.\n\u2022The company's industry is highly competitive and the consolidation of customers and competitors could result in a loss of customers or in additional competitive pricing pressures.\n\u2022The company's business strategy relies on certain assumptions concerning demographic trends that impact the market for its products. If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, demand for the company's products may be lower than expected.\nRisks Related to Financial Results and Liquidity\n\u2022The terms of the company's current and future debt facilities and financing arrangements may limit the company's flexibility in operating its business.\n\u2022The company's leverage and debt obligations could adversely affect its financial condition, limit its ability to raise additional capital to fund its operations, impact the way it operates its business and prevent it from fulfilling its debt service and other obligations.\n\u2022The company may not be able to repay or refinance its convertible notes or other debt obligations, and the issuance of common shares upon conversion of the convertible notes could cause dilution to the company's existing shareholders.\n\u2022The company's convertible notes have certain fundamental change and conditional conversion\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nfeatures which, if triggered, may adversely affect the company's financial condition.\nRisks Related to Information Technology and Reliance on Third Parties\n\u2022Any major disruption or failure of the company\u2019s information technology systems, or its failure to successfully implement new technology effectively, could adversely affect the company.\n\u2022Cyber security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the company's systems, networks, products and services, and a risk to the company's compliance with data privacy laws.\n\u2022As the company outsources functions, it becomes more dependent on the entities performing those functions. Disruptions or delays at, or lack of performance by, the company\u2019s third-party service providers could adversely impact its operations.\nRegulatory and Development Risks\n\u2022The company remains subject to a consent decree of injunction with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and failure by the company to comply with the consent decree could adversely affect the company.\n\u2022Any failure by the company to comply with medical device regulatory requirements or receive regulatory clearance or approval for the company's products or operations in the United States or abroad could adversely affect the company.\n\u2022If the company fails to comply with applicable health care laws or regulations, the company could suffer severe civil or criminal sanctions or may be required to make significant changes to the company's operations.\n\u2022Legislative developments in all regions in which the company operates may adversely affect the company.\nIntellectual Property Risks\n\u2022The company's operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if the\ncompany becomes involved in litigation regarding its patents or other intellectual property rights.\n\u2022If the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights or resolve successfully claims of infringement brought against it, the company's product sales and business could be affected adversely.\nManufacturing and Supply Risks\n\u2022Decreased availability or increased costs of materials could increase the company's costs of producing its products.\n\u2022Inflationary economic conditions have increased, and may continue to increase, the company's costs of producing its products.\n\u2022Geopolitical risks, such as those associated with Russia's recent invasion of Ukraine, could result in increased market volatility and uncertainty, which could negatively impact the company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\u2022The company's ability to manage an effective supply chain is a key success factor.\nOther Regulatory and Litigation Risks\n\u2022The company is subject to certain risks inherent in managing and operating businesses in many different foreign jurisdictions.\n\u2022The impact of \"Brexit\" may adversely affect the company.\n\u2022The company's products may be subject to product liability claims or recalls, which could be costly, harm the company's reputation and adversely affect its business.\nOther Risk Factors - Other Financial Risks, Risks Related to Employees and the Company's Common Shares\n\u2022The company has long-term finance leases on significant facilities which can affect the company's liquidity and cash flow.\n\u2022The company's revenues and profits are subject to exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations which can affect the company's profitability and cash flow.\nPart I Table of Contents\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n\u2022Additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect the company's future profitability and cash flow.\n\u2022The company's net operating losses, foreign tax credits and interest carryforwards may be limited for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\u2022The company's reported results may be adversely affected by increases in reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable.\n\u2022The inability to attract and retain, or loss of the services of, the company's key management and personnel could adversely affect its ability to operate the company's business.\n\u2022Volatility in the market price of the company's common shares could adversely affect its shareholders, its ability to finance operations or attract and retain leadership.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, the company\u2019s operations and could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business, financial condition and liquidity, including the ability for end users to access to the company's products.\nThe present COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the company\u2019s operations and affected the company\u2019s business, and may continue to do so, due to many factors, including imposition by government authorities of mandatory closures, work-from-home orders, social distancing protocols, increased employee absenteeism due to illness and/or quarantine requirements, and voluntary facility closures or other restrictions that could materially adversely affect the company\u2019s ability to adequately staff and maintain its operations. Specifically, the company experienced at least one mandatory temporary facility closure, and may experience in the future other temporary facility closures, in response to government mandates in certain jurisdictions in which the company operates or in response to positive diagnoses for COVID-19 in certain facilities for the safety of the company\u2019s associates or as a result of employee absenteeism due to infections.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also disrupted, and is expected to continue to disrupt, the company\u2019s operations and the operations of the company's suppliers and may materially adversely impact its ability to secure raw materials, components and supplies for its facilities and to provide personal protective equipment for its employees. There may also be long-term negative effects on the economic well-being of company\u2019s customers and in the economies of affected countries, which may limit their\naccess or expenditures on health care. The pandemic has caused, and may in the future cause, temporary closure of, or restricted access to, health care provider facilities where the company's products are demonstrated, trialed, fitted and sold. Limitations on non-acute care due to the pandemic have delayed or reduced, and if reimposed may in the future delay or reduce, the ability for end users to gain access to the company's products.\nGovernment actions in response to the COVID-19\npandemic continue to change and evolve. As a result, the countries in which the company\u2019s products are manufactured and distributed remain under varying stages of restrictions. Certain jurisdictions have had to, or may in the future have to, re-establish restrictions due to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases or the development of new strains of COVID-19. Additionally, although access to elective healthcare by patients and access to healthcare for many of the company\u2019s customers has been at least partially restored or increased, such access may again be limited or closed if a resurgence of COVID-19 cases occurs, new strains of COVID-19 develop, or if efforts to combat COVID-19, including vaccine development or distribution, are ineffective or prolonged. Even as government restrictions have been lifted and economies gradually reopened, the shape of the economic recovery remains uncertain and may continue to negatively impact the company's results of operations, cash flows and financial position in subsequent quarters. Given this current level of economic and operational uncertainty over the impacts of COVID-19, the ultimate financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic or a similar widespread outbreak of disease in the future could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s ability to operate, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, public health restrictions and preventive measures the company may voluntarily put in place, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business for an indefinite period of time, such as the potential shut down of certain locations, decreased employee availability and border closures, among others. The pandemic could cause an increasingly competitive labor market due to sustained labor shortages or increased turnover rates within the company's employee base. The company\u2019s suppliers and customers may also face these and other challenges, which could lead to continued disruption in the company\u2019s supply chain, as well as decreased customer demand for the company\u2019s products. These issues may also materially affect the company\u2019s future access to its sources of liquidity, particularly its cash flows from operations, financial condition and capitalization. Although these disruptions are anticipated to continue in 2022, the long-term economic impact and near-term financial impacts of\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nsuch issues, may not be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainty of future developments.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to a global shipping and logistics crisis, including shortages in the availability of, and increasing costs for, container shipping and has disrupted, and is expected to continue to disrupt, the company\u2019s ability to obtain critical products, components and raw materials which could have a material, adverse effect on the company\u2019s business, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe global impacts surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, including operational and manufacturing disruptions, logistical constraints and travel restrictions, have contributed to substantial and ongoing delays, disruptions and shortages in the availability of shipping and logistics services. In particular, shortages of the availability of, and soaring cost increases for, container shipping have disrupted the company\u2019s ability to obtain, and increased the cost of obtaining, critical products, components and raw materials for its business. These factors have negatively impacted the company's ability to operate and to the extent that these negative impacts continue, they could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate many of the other risks discussed in this Risk Factors section and throughout this report.\nCommercial and Operational Risks\nIf the company's business improvement efforts are ineffective, the company's strategic goals, business plans, financial performance or liquidity could be negatively impacted.\nThe company has been implementing a multi-year business improvement strategy intended to substantially improve its business and re-orient its resources to a more clinically complex mix of products and solutions. To date, this strategy has included actions to re-orient the company's global commercial team, continue the company's innovation pipeline, shift its product mix, develop and expand its talent, and strengthen its balance sheet. The company also has taken steps to realign infrastructure and processes that are intended to drive efficiency and reduce costs.\nThe company may not be successful in achieving the full long-term growth and profitability, operating efficiencies and cost reductions, or other benefits expected from these business improvement efforts in a timely manner or at all. The company also may experience business disruptions associated with these activities. Further, the full benefits of the strategy, if realized, may be\nrealized later than expected, the costs of implementing the strategy may be greater than anticipated, and the company may lack adequate cash or capital or may not be able to attract and retain the necessary talent, to complete the improvement actions. In addition, the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in increased costs associated with, and delayed execution of, business improvement initiatives. If these business improvement measures are not successful, the company may undertake additional actions, which could result in future expenses. If the company's business improvement efforts prove ineffective, the company's ability to achieve its strategic goals and business plans, and the company's financial performance, including its ability to repay or refinance its indebtedness and satisfy other obligations, may be materially adversely affected. Under these circumstances, the company may require additional financing, which may be difficult or expensive to obtain, and the company can make no assurances that it would be available on terms acceptable to the company, if at all. Refer to Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\" The company also may evaluate and implement changes to its strategic goals and business plans, which may involve restructuring of its operations. If undertaken, any such restructuring may be substantial and involve significant effort and expense, and the company can make no assurances that such efforts, if undertaken, would be successful and result in improvements to the company business performance and financial condition,\nIf the company is unable to attract and retain critical IT Governance, Project Management and Contract Management competencies it may limit the effectiveness of the company's cost improvement and business efficiency initiatives and adversely affect the company's profitability and growth.\nThe company is implementing a multi-year business improvement strategy which involves projects focused on streamlining the company\u2019s supply chain and operations infrastructure, upgrading and modernizing its information technology capabilities and implementation of new ERP systems in conjunction with its third-party outsourcing service provider. In addition, the company has outsourced certain key functions to third-party service providers and may continue to do so in the future. The success of these activities is dependent on the company\u2019s ability to maintain an adequate IT governance management structure and adequate capabilities in project management and contract management functions. Despite its efforts to build and maintain these capabilities, the company could have inadequate skills, personnel, management skills, or processes necessary to successfully implement the programs and projects necessary to successfully improve the business and achieve the intended operating efficiencies and cost reductions from such programs and\nPart I Table of Contents\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nprojects, which in turn may adversely affect the company's profitability and growth.\nChanges in government and other third-party payor reimbursement levels and practices have negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact the company's revenues and profitability.\nThe company's products are sold primarily through a network of medical equipment and home health care providers, extended care facilities and other providers such as various government-provider agencies throughout the world. Many of these providers (the company's customers) are reimbursed for the products and services provided to their customers and patients by third-party payors, such as government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs. Most of these programs set maximum reimbursement levels for some of the products sold by the company in the United States and abroad. If third-party payors deny coverage, make the reimbursement process or documentation requirements more uncertain or reduce their levels of reimbursement, or if the company is unable to reduce its costs of production to keep pace with decreases in reimbursement levels, the company may be unable to sell the affected product(s) through its distribution channels on a profitable basis.\nReduced government reimbursement levels and changes in reimbursement policies have in the past added, and could continue to add, significant pressure to the company's revenues and profitability. For example, the National Competitive Bidding, or \u201cNCB\u201d, program introduced by CMS beginning in January 2011 has had the effect of substantially reducing reimbursement and payment rates for medical equipment and supplies by Medicare. The reduced reimbursement and payment rates have, in some cases, prompted customers to consider lower-priced alternatives to the company's products and compelled the company to reduce prices on certain products, which has negatively impacted the company's revenues and profitability. In October 2020, CMS announced the delay to changes to NCB for three years. The potential impact of any modifications may be uncertain and may further negatively impact the company's revenues and profitability. Refer to \u201cItem 1. Business -Government Regulation-National Competitive Bidding.\u201d\nSimilar trends and concerns are occurring in state Medicaid programs. These recent changes to reimbursement policies, and any additional unfavorable reimbursement policies or budgetary cuts that may be adopted in the future, could adversely affect the demand for the company's products by customers who depend on reimbursement from the government-funded programs. The percentage of the company's overall sales that are\ndependent on Medicare or other insurance programs may increase as the portion of the U.S. population over age 65 continues to grow, making the company more vulnerable to reimbursement level reductions by these organizations. Reduced government reimbursement levels also could result in reduced private payor reimbursement levels because some third-party payors index their reimbursement schedules to Medicare fee schedules. Reductions in reimbursement levels also may affect the profitability of the company's customers and ultimately force some customers without strong financial resources to become unable to pay their bills as they come due or go out of business. The reimbursement reductions may prove to be so dramatic that some of the company's customers may not be able to adapt quickly enough to survive. The company is one of the industry's significant creditors and an increase in bankruptcies or financial weakness in the company's customer base could have an adverse effect on the company's financial results.\nOutside the U.S., reimbursement systems vary significantly by country. Many foreign markets have government-managed health care systems that govern reimbursement for home health care products. The ability of hospitals and other providers supported by such systems to purchase the company's products is dependent, in part, upon public budgetary constraints. Various countries have tightened reimbursement rates and other countries may follow. If adequate levels of reimbursement from third-party payors outside of the U.S. are not obtained, international sales of the company's products may decline, which could adversely affect the company's net sales.\nThe impact of all the above is uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nIf the company's products are not included within an adequate number of customer formularies, or if pricing policies otherwise favor competitors' products, the company's market share and gross margin could be negatively affected.\nMany of the medical equipment and home health care providers to whom the company sells its products negotiate the price of products and develop formularies which establish pricing and reimbursement levels. Many of these providers also compensate their sales personnel based on the formulary position of the products they sell. Exclusion of a product from a formulary, unfavorable positioning of a product within a formulary, or lower compensation levels for customer sales personnel associated with the products can lead to such product's sharply reduced usage in the provider's patient population. If the company's products are not included, or favorably positioned, within an adequate number of formularies, or if the pricing policies or sales\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\ncompensation programs of providers otherwise favor other products, the company's sales revenues, market share and gross margin could be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe company's industry is highly competitive and the consolidation of health care provider customers and the company's competitors could result in a loss of customers or in additional competitive pricing pressures.\nThe home medical equipment market is highly competitive and the company's products face significant competition from other well established manufacturers. Numerous initiatives and reforms instituted by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to reduce home medical equipment costs have caused pricing pressures which have resulted in a consolidation trend in the home medical equipment industry as well as among the company's customers, including home health care providers. In the past, some of the company's competitors, which may include distributors, have been lowering the purchase prices of their products in an effort to attract customers. This in turn has resulted in greater pricing pressures, including pressure to offer customers more competitive pricing terms, exclusion of products from or unfavorable position on provider formularies and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of the company's customers. Further consolidation could result in a loss of customers, increased collectability risks, or increased competitive pricing pressures. In addition, as reimbursement pressures persist, some customers may directly source their own products to secure a low-cost advantage.\nThe company's business strategy relies on certain assumptions concerning demographic trends that impact the market for its products. If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, demand for the company's products may be lower than expected.\nThe company's ability to achieve its business objectives is subject to a variety of factors, including the relative increase in the aging of the general population. The company believes that these trends will increase the need for its products. The projected demand for the company's products could materially differ from actual demand if the company's assumptions regarding these trends and acceptance of its products by health care professionals and patients prove to be incorrect or do not materialize. If the company's assumptions regarding these factors prove to be incorrect, the company may not be able to successfully implement the company's business strategy, which could adversely affect the company's results of operations. In\naddition, the perceived benefits of these trends may be offset by competitive or business factors, such as the introduction of new products by the company's competitors or the emergence of other countervailing trends, including lower reimbursement and pricing.\nRisks Related to Financial Results and Liquidity\nThe terms of the company's current and future debt facilities and financing arrangements may limit the company's flexibility in operating its business.\nThe company's credit agreement provides the company and certain of the company's U.S., Canadian, U.K. and French subsidiaries with the ability to borrow under senior secured revolving credit, letter of credit and swing line loan facilities. The aggregate borrowing availability under the credit facilities is determined based on borrowing base formulas set forth in the credit agreement. The credit facilities are secured by substantially all the company's domestic and Canadian assets, other than real estate, and by substantially all the personal property assets of the company's U.K. subsidiaries and Netherlands subsidiary. The credit agreement contains customary default provisions, with certain grace periods and exceptions, that include, among other things, failure to pay amounts due, breach of covenants, representations or warranties, bankruptcy, the occurrence of a material adverse effect, exclusion from any medical reimbursement program, and an interruption of any material manufacturing facilities for more than ten consecutive days.\nIn addition, the company may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the terms of the agreements governing existing debt restrict the company's ability to incur additional debt (including secured debt), such restrictions are subject to several exceptions and qualifications and such restrictions and qualifications may be waived or amended, and debt (including secured debt) incurred in compliance with such restrictions and qualifications (as they may be waived or amended) may be substantial. To the extent new debt, in particular secured debt, is added to the company's current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described above and below would increase.\nThe restrictive terms of the company's credit agreement and future debt may limit the company's ability to conduct and expand its business and pursue its business strategies. The company's ability to comply with the provisions of its credit agreements and agreements governing future debt can be affected by events beyond its control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, or by government enforcement actions, such as, for example, adverse impacts from the FDA consent decree of injunction. If the company is\nPart I Table of Contents\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nunable to comply with the provisions in the credit agreement or other debt, it could result in a default which could trigger acceleration of, or the right to accelerate, the related debt. Because of cross-default provisions in its agreements and instruments governing certain of the company's indebtedness, a default under the credit agreement or other debt could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, certain other company indebtedness. In addition, the company's lenders would be entitled to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness.\nThe company's ability to meet its liquidity needs will depend on many factors, including the operating performance of the business, as well as the company's continued compliance with the covenants under its credit agreement. Refer to \"Commercial and Operational Risks - If the company's business improvement efforts are ineffective, the company's strategic goals, business plans, financial performance or liquidity could be negatively impacted.\" and Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\" Notwithstanding the company's expectations, if the company's operating results decline, the company may be unable to comply with the financial covenants, and its lenders could demand repayment of the amounts outstanding under the company's credit facility.\nThe company also has an agreement with De Lage Landen, Inc. (\u201cDLL\u201d), a third-party financing company, to provide financing to the company's U.S. customers. Either party could terminate this agreement with 180 days' notice or 90 days' notice by DLL upon the occurrence of certain events. Should this agreement be terminated, the company's borrowing needs under the credit agreement could increase.\nThe company's leverage and debt obligations could adversely affect its financial condition, limit its ability to raise additional capital to fund its operations, impact the way it operates its business and prevent it from fulfilling its debt service and other obligations.\nThe company has significant outstanding indebtedness and may incur significant additional debt in the future. As of December 31, 2021, the company had outstanding, $2,650,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes that mature in June 2022 (the \u201c2022 Notes\u201d), $72,909,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Series I Convertible Senior Notes that mature in November 2024 (the \u201cSeries I 2024 Notes\u201d), $79,222,000 aggregate principal and accretion amount of 5.00% Series II Convertible Senior Notes that mature in November 2024 (the \"Series II 2024 Notes\") and $125,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes that mature in March 2026 (the \u201c2026 Notes\u201d). The company has an Amended and\nRestated Credit Agreement providing for asset-based lending senior secured revolving credit facilities which mature in January 2024 with outstanding indebtedness at December 31, 2021 of $35,502,000.\nThe company's indebtedness could have important negative consequences, including:\n\u2022reduced availability of cash for the company's operations and other business activities after satisfying interest payments and other requirements under the terms of its debt instruments;\n\u2022less flexibility to plan for or react to competitive challenges, and suffer a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that do not have as much indebtedness;\n\u2022difficulty in obtaining additional financing in the future;\n\u2022inability to comply with covenants in, and potential for default under, the company's debt instruments; and\n\u2022challenges to repaying or refinancing any of the company's debt.\nThe company\u2019s ability to satisfy its debt and other obligations will depend principally upon its future operating performance. As a result, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, legal and regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond the company\u2019s control, may affect its ability to make payments on its debt and other obligations. If it does not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt and other obligations, the company may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring its debt, exchanging debt for equity, selling assets, seeking additional capital or reducing or delaying capital investments. The company\u2019s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on the capital markets and the company\u2019s financial condition at the time. Restructuring or refinancing indebtedness could require the company to issue additional debt (including secured debt), pay additional fees and interest, issue potentially dilutive additional equity, further encumber certain of the company\u2019s assets, agree to covenants that could restrict its future operations and pay related transaction fees and expenses. Any such measures would require agreements with counterparties, including potentially the company\u2019s existing creditors, and may not be successful on attractive terms or otherwise. Whether or not successful, any such measures may have a negative impact on the company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, including on the market price of the company\u2019s common stock and debt securities.\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nRefer to Item 7. \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nThe company may not be able to repay or refinance its convertible notes, and the issuance of common shares upon conversion of the convertible notes could cause dilution to the company's existing shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the company had outstanding $2,650,000, $72,909,000, $79,222,000 and $125,000,000 aggregate principal amount (with accretion in the case of the Series II 2024 Notes) of its 2022 Notes, Series I 2024 Notes, its Series II 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes, respectively. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 1, 2021 (with respect to the 2022 Notes) and prior to the close of business on the business day preceding May 15, 2024 (with respect to the Series I 2024 Notes and Series II 2024 Notes), the notes will be convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions. Holders may convert their 2022 Notes at their option at any time after December 1, 2021 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding June 1, 2022, holders may convert their Series I 2024 and Series II 2024 Notes at their option at any time after May 15, 2024 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding November 15, 2024 and holders may convert their 2026 Notes at their option at any time after September 15, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding March 15, 2026.\nAny use of cash upon conversion or maturity of the notes could adversely affect the company\u2019s liquidity, and the company may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time it is required to pay cash in settlement of notes being converted or maturing. Furthermore, the company may seek to refinance the 2022 Notes, the Series I 2024, the Series II 2024 Notes and/or the 2026 Notes prior to maturity, and there is no assurance that the company will be able to do so on attractive terms or at all.\nThe company may settle conversions of the notes by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, common shares, or a combination of cash and common shares, at the company's election. If any such conversions occur and the company has authority, and so elects, to settle some or all of the converted notes in common shares, the number of shares issued could be significant and such an issuance could cause dilution to the interests of the existing shareholders.\nThe company's convertible notes have certain fundamental change and conditional conversion features which, if triggered, may adversely affect the company's financial condition.\nIf a fundamental change occurs under the company's 2022 Notes, Series I 2024, Series II 2024 Notes or its 2026 Notes the holders of the notes may require the company to purchase for cash any or all of the notes. A fundamental change includes a delisting of the company's common stock from eligible securities exchanges, subject to certain exceptions. Certain fundamental changes are beyond the control of the company. However, there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient funds at the time of the fundamental change to purchase all of the notes delivered for purchase, and it may not be able to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms, if at all. Likewise, if one of the conversion contingencies of the notes is triggered, holders of notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods. If the company desires to settle any portion of any converted notes through the payment of cash, there can be no assurance that it will have sufficient funds to purchase all of the notes delivered for purchase, and the company may not be able to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms, if at all. If the company elects to settle any converted notes through the issuance of common shares, it would have a dilutive effect on shareholders\u2019 interests.\nIf a fundamental change occurs under the company's 2022 Notes, the company may be obligated to settle the outstanding common shares warrants issued to the respective counterparties in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes. If exercised, the warrants may obligate the company to issue a substantial number of common shares to the counterparty, which would have a dilutive effect on shareholders\u2019 interests. If the warrant is terminated upon a fundamental change, the company may be obligated to make a substantial cash termination payment to the counterparty, and there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient funds to do so.\nIn addition, whether following a fundamental change or otherwise, the counterparties to the company\u2019s convertible note hedge and warrant transactions and capped call transactions or their respective affiliates may modify their initial hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives contracts with respect to the company\u2019s common shares and/or purchasing or selling common shares or other securities of the company in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the notes. This activity could cause, or prevent what would otherwise be a significant change in the market price of the company\u2019s common shares.\nPart I Table of Contents\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Information Technology and Reliance on Third Parties\nAny major disruption or failure of the company\u2019s information technology systems, or its failure to successfully implement new technology effectively, could adversely affect the company.\nThe company relies on various information technology systems to manage its operations. The company has outsourced substantially all of its information technology services to Birlasoft Solutions, Inc. The company has contracted with Birlasoft to implement, over a multi-year period, modifications and upgrades to the company's systems, including making changes to legacy systems, replacing legacy systems with successor systems with new functionality and acquiring new systems with new functionality. Among other projects, the company has engaged Birlasoft to assist in implementing a new enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") system across the company. These activities subject the company to inherent risks associated with replacing and upgrading these systems, including impairment of its ability to fulfill customer orders, potential disruption of its internal control structure, additional administration and operating expenses, reliance on Birlasoft providing sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems, demands on management time, and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new or upgraded systems or of integrating new or upgraded systems into the company\u2019s current systems. If any of these inherent risks develop or if Birlasoft\u2019s capabilities prove to be insufficient to successfully implement and operate the new systems, implementation may be substantially delayed, the assistance of alternative service providers may be engaged, the company\u2019s business may be disrupted, and costs may substantially increase. Even if successfully implemented, the new systems may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the risks and burdens of implementation, or at all. In addition, the difficulties with implementing new or upgraded technology systems may cause disruptions in its business operations. Any of these developments may have an adverse effect on the company's business and operations.\nCybersecurity threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the company's systems, networks, products and services, and a risk to the company's compliance with data privacy laws.\nGlobal IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of the company's systems and networks as well as the confidentiality, protection, availability and integrity of the company's data and any personal data on such networks or systems, including regulatory risks under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),\namong other risks. In addition, data security breaches can also occur as a result of a failure by the company or its employees to follow policies, procedures or training, or by acts, omissions or breaches by persons with whom the company has commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information.\nThrough its sales channels, the company may collect and store personal or confidential information that customers provide to purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs and register on the company's website, among other reasons. The company may also acquire and retain information about customers, product end users, suppliers and employees in the normal course of\nbusiness. The company also creates and maintains proprietary information that is critical to its business, such\nas its product designs and manufacturing processes. In addition to the company\u2019s own databases, it uses third-party service providers to store, process and transmit confidential or personal information on its behalf. Although the company contractually requires these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures and to comply with laws relating to privacy and data protection, the company cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a data security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems. Some of the company\u2019s information technology systems have aged and are no longer supported or maintained by the original system vendors. Despite the company's efforts to secure its systems and networks, and any personal or sensitive information stored thereon, the company could experience a significant data security breach. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate the company's or its vendors' information systems and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer, supplier, employee or other business or personal information, including company intellectual property. Third parties could also gain control of company systems and use them for criminal purposes. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could result in the loss of existing customers, difficulty in attracting new customers, exposure to claims from customers, governmental or data privacy or data protection authorities, financial institutions, payment card associations, employees and other persons, imposition of regulatory sanctions or penalties, incurring of additional expenses or lost revenues, or other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and results of operations.\nAs the company outsources functions, it becomes more dependent on the entities performing those functions. Disruptions or delays at the company\u2019s third-party service providers could adversely impact its operations.\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAs part of its actions to improve business efficiency, the company has sought opportunities to provide essential business services in a more cost-effective manner. In some cases, this results in the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers. For example, the company has recently outsourced a significant portion of its information technology functions to Birlasoft Solutions Inc. While the company believes it conducts appropriate diligence before entering into agreements with any outsourcing entity, the failure of one or more of such entities to meet the company\u2019s performance standards and expectations, including with respect to service levels, data security, compliance with data protection and privacy laws, providing services on a timely basis or providing services at the prices the company expects, may have an adverse effect on the company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the company could face increased costs or disruption associated with finding replacement vendors or hiring new employees in order to return these services in-house. The company may outsource other functions in the future, which would increase its reliance on third parties.\nRegulatory and Development Risks\nThe company remains subject to a consent decree of injunction with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and failure by the company to comply with the consent decree could adversely affect the company.\nIn December 2012, the company became subject to a consent decree of injunction filed by the FDA with respect to the company's Corporate facility and its Taylor Street manufacturing facility in Elyria, Ohio. The consent decree initially limited the company's (i) manufacture and distribution of power and manual wheelchairs, wheelchair components and wheelchair sub-assemblies at or from its Taylor Street manufacturing facility, except in verified cases of medical necessity, (ii) design activities related to wheelchairs and power beds that take place at the impacted Elyria facilities and (iii) replacement, service and repair of products already in use from the Taylor Street manufacturing facility. Under the terms of the consent decree, in order to resume full operations, the company had to successfully complete independent, third-party expert certification audits at the impacted Elyria facilities, comprising three distinct certification reports separately submitted to, and accepted by, the FDA; submit its own report to the FDA; and successfully complete a reinspection by the FDA of the company's Corporate and Taylor Street facilities.\nOn July 24, 2017, following its reinspection, the FDA notified the company that it was in substantial compliance with the QSR and the Federal Food, Cosmetic\n& Drug Act (The FDA Act), the FDA regulations and the terms of the consent decree that the company was permitted to resume full operations at those facilities including the resumption of unrestricted sales of products made in those facilities.\nThe consent decree will continue in effect for a minimum of five years from July 24, 2017, during which time the company's Corporate and Taylor Street facilities must complete two semi-annual audits in the first year and then four annual audits in the next four years performed by an independent company retained audit firm. The expert audit firm will determine whether the facilities remain in continuous compliance with the FDA Act, regulations and the terms of the consent decree. Thus far, the two semi-annual audits and the first three annual audits have been completed successfully. The FDA has the authority to inspect these facilities and any other FDA registered facility, at any time.\nIn 2021, FDA conducted an inspection of the company\u2019s Corporate and Taylor Street facilities from May 25 through June 24, 2021. At the close of the inspection, six FDA Form 483 observations were issued, and the company timely responded to FDA, has diligently taken actions to address FDA\u2019s inspectional observations, and has provided FDA monthly updates on the corrective actions taken to address these observations. On November 18, 2021, the company received a warning letter from the FDA, which we refer to as the Warning Letter, concerning certain of the inspectional observations in the June 2021 FDA Form 483 related to the complaint handling process, the corrective and preventive action, or CAPA, process, and medical device reporting, or MDR, associated with oxygen concentrators. On November 16, 2021, the company received a consent decree non-compliance letter from the FDA concerning the same complaint and CAPA handling matters as in the Warning Letter observations but associated with the Taylor Street products, which letter we refer to together with the Warning Letter as the FDA Letters. The company timely responded to the FDA Letters, has diligently taken actions to address FDA\u2019s concerns, and has provided FDA with periodic updates on the corrective actions taken to address the matters in the FDA Letters. The company remains committed to resolving the FDA\u2019s concerns; however, it is not possible to predict the outcome or timing of a resolution at this time. There can be no assurance that the FDA will be satisfied with the company\u2019s responses to the FDA Letters, nor any assurance as to the timeframe that may be required for the company to adequately address the FDA\u2019s concerns or whether the matters in the FDA Letters will result in an extension in the duration of the consent decree. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Government Regulation- 2012 Consent Decree, Taylor Street and Corporate Facilities\u201d for further discussion of the FDA Letters.\nPart I Table of Contents\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe FDA also has the authority to order the company to take a wide variety of remedial actions if the FDA finds that the company is not in compliance with the consent decree or FDA regulations. The FDA also has authority under the consent decree to assess liquidated damages for any violations of the consent decree, FDA regulations or the FDA Act. Any such failure by the company to comply with the consent decree, the FDA Act or FDA regulations, or any need to complete significant remediation as a result of any such audits or inspections, or actions taken by the FDA as a result of any such failure to comply, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nThe limitations previously imposed by the FDA consent decree negatively affected net sales in the North America segment and, to a certain extent, the Asia Pacific region beginning in 2012. The limitations led to delays in new product introductions. Further, uncertainty regarding how long the limitations would be in effect limited the company's ability to renegotiate and bid on certain customer contracts and otherwise led to a decline in customer orders.\nAlthough the company has been permitted to resume full operations at the Corporate and Taylor Street facilities, the negative effect of the consent decree on customer orders and net sales in the North America segment and Asia Pacific region has been considerable, and it is uncertain as to whether, or how quickly, the company will be able to rebuild net sales to more typical historical levels, irrespective of market conditions. Accordingly, when compared to the company's 2010 results, the previous limitations in the consent decree had, and likely may continue to have, a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAny failure by the company to comply with medical device regulatory requirements or receive regulatory clearance or approval for the company's products or operations in the United States or abroad could adversely affect the company's business.\nThe company's medical devices are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by the FDA, and by similar governmental authorities in the foreign countries where the company does business. The FDA regulates virtually all aspects of a medical device's development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, distribution and marketing. In addition, the company is required to file reports with the FDA if the company's products may have caused, or contributed to, a death or serious injury, or if they malfunction and would be likely to cause, or\ncontribute to, a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. In general, unless an exemption applies, the company's mobility and respiratory therapy products must receive a pre-market clearance from the FDA before they can be marketed in the United States. The FDA also regulates the export of medical devices to foreign countries. The company cannot be assured that any of the company's devices, to the extent required, will be cleared by the FDA through the pre-market clearance process or that the FDA will provide export certificates that are necessary to export certain of the company's products for sale in certain foreign countries. If the company is unable to obtain export certificates for its products, it will limit the company's ability to support foreign markets with such products, which may have an adverse impact on the company's business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the company is required to obtain pre-market clearances to market modifications to the company's existing products or market its existing products for new indications. The FDA requires device manufacturers themselves to make and document a determination as to whether a modification requires a new clearance; however, the FDA can review and disagree with a manufacturer's decision. The company may not be successful in receiving clearances in the future or the FDA may not agree with the company's decisions not to seek clearances for any particular device modification. The FDA may require a clearance for any past or future modification or a new indication for the company's existing products. Such submissions may require the submission of additional data and may be time consuming and costly, and ultimately, may not be cleared by the FDA.\nIf the FDA requires the company to obtain pre-market clearances for any modification to a previously cleared device, the company may be required to cease manufacturing and marketing the modified device or to recall the modified device until the company obtains FDA clearance, and the company may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. In addition, the FDA may not clear these submissions in a timely manner, if at all. The FDA also may change its policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, each of which could prevent or delay pre-market clearance of the company's devices, or could impact the company's ability to market a device that was previously cleared. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect the company's business.\nAny failure by the company to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA and other applicable U.S. regulatory requirements may subject the company to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions. These sanctions include warning letters, civil penalties, criminal penalties, injunctions, consent decrees, product seizure or detention, product recalls and total or partial suspension of production, any of which could materially adversely affect\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nthe company's business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. In November 2021, the company received the FDA Letters. See the preceding risk factor \u201c-The company remains subject to a consent decree of injunction with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and failure by the company to comply with the consent decree could adversely affect the company\u201d and \u201cItem 1. Business - Government Regulation - 2012 Consent Decree, Taylor Street and Corporate Facilities.\u201d\nAs part of its regulatory function, the FDA routinely inspects the facilities of medical device companies and has continued to actively inspect the company's facilities, other than through the processes established under the consent decree. The company expects that the FDA will from time to time, inspect substantially all the company's domestic and foreign FDA-registered operational facilities and may do so repeatedly. The results of regulatory claims, proceedings or investigations are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution or outcome of any matter that may arise out of any FDA inspection of the company's facilities, including, for example, the matters in the FDA Letters, could materially and adversely affect the company's business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nIn many of the foreign countries in which the company manufactures or markets its products, the company is subject to extensive medical device regulations that are similar to those of the FDA, including those in Europe. The regulation of the company's products in Europe falls primarily within the United Kingdom (\"UK\") and the European Economic Area, which consists of the European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Only medical devices that comply with certain conformity requirements of the European Medical Device Regulation (\"EMDR\") are allowed to be marketed within the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom. The company's Class I products were required to comply with the EMDR as of May 2021. Class IIa and IIb products are required to comply with the EMDR by no later than the expiration of their respective current Medical Device Directive (\"MDD\") certifications, which will begin to expire in September 2023. Products that fail to be certified with the EMDR may not be marketed or sold in the European Union. As a result of Brexit, beginning on January 1, 2021, the company's products sold in Great Britain have been required to be registered with the Medical and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (\"MHRA\") and the company is required to appoint an Authorized Representative (\"AR\") in the UK. Products in conformity with the MDD may continue to be marked with their CE marking in the UK until June 2023, after which time products must be certified by a UK recognized Notified Body. In addition, beginning May 26, 2021, the company's products sold in Switzerland have been required to be registered with Swissmedic and the company is required to appoint an AR in Switzerland. In addition, the national health or social\nsecurity organizations of certain foreign countries, including those outside Europe, require the company's products to be qualified before they can be marketed in those countries. Failure to receive, or delays in the receipt of, relevant foreign qualifications in the European Economic Area, the UK, Switzerland or other foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. The company and its products are subject to registration requirements and regulations in various states and political subdivisions inside and outside of the United States. Failure by the company to comply with these requirements and regulations could have an adverse effect on the company or its business.\nUnder the EMDR and MDD, Notified Bodies have the right to conduct unannounced audits. Under the EMDR, the company will be subject to annual audits by a Notified Body for its Class IIa and IIb products, which would include on-site audits of the company's facilities in Elyria, Ohio and unannounced audits at least once every five years. In addition, the relevant regulatory authorities in various European countries may conduct audits of the company's facilities. Any significant findings from any such audits may impact the company's ability to manufacture or market certain products in those markets, or result in other unfavorable outcomes, that could materially and adversely affect the company's business.\nIf the company fails to comply with applicable health care laws or regulations, the company could suffer severe civil or criminal sanctions or may be required to make significant changes to the company's operations.\nThe company sells its products principally to medical equipment and home health care providers who resell or rent those products to consumers. Many of those providers (the company's customers) are reimbursed by third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, for the company products sold to their customers and patients. The U.S. federal government and the governments in the states and other countries in which the company operates regulate many aspects of the company's business and the business of the company's customers. As a part of the health care industry, the company and its customers are subject to extensive government regulation, including numerous laws directed at preventing fraud and abuse and laws regulating reimbursement under various government programs. The marketing, invoicing, documenting and other practices of health care suppliers and manufacturers are all subject to government scrutiny. Government agencies periodically open investigations and obtain information from health care suppliers and manufacturers pursuant to the legal process. Violations of law or regulations can result in severe administrative, civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including disqualification from Medicare and other reimbursement programs, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. While the company has established numerous\nPart I Table of Contents\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\npolicies and procedures to address compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts will be effective to prevent a material adverse effect on the company's business from noncompliance issues.\nHealth care is an area of rapid regulatory change. Changes in the law and new interpretations of existing laws may affect permissible activities, the costs associated with doing business, and reimbursement amounts paid by federal, state and other third-party payors, all of which may affect the company and its customers. The company cannot predict the future of federal, state and local regulation or legislation, including Medicare and Medicaid statutes and regulations, or possible changes in health care policies in any country in which the company conducts business. Future legislation and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.\nLegislative developments in all regions in which the company operates may adversely affect the company.\nFuture healthcare legislation, including any significant reform of existing healthcare laws, whether in the U.S. or in our other global markets, along with any programs implemented by such laws, whether at a federal or state level, may reduce reimbursements for the company's products, may impact the demand for the company's products and may impact the prices at which the company sells its products. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nThe company's operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if the company becomes involved in litigation regarding its patents or other intellectual property rights.\nLitigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the company's industry, and other companies within the company's industry have used intellectual property litigation in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage. The company has been a party to lawsuits involving patents or other intellectual property. If the company were to receive an adverse judgment in any such proceeding, a court or a similar foreign governing body could invalidate or render unenforceable the company's owned or licensed patents, require the company to pay significant damages, seek licenses and/or pay ongoing royalties to third parties, require the company to redesign its products, or prevent the company from manufacturing, using or selling its products, any of which could have an adverse effect on the company's results of operations and financial condition. The company has\nbrought actions against third parties for infringement of the company's intellectual property rights. The company may not succeed in these actions. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property actions and lawsuits in the courts, proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or its foreign equivalents and related legal and administrative proceedings are both costly and time consuming. Protracted litigation to defend, prosecute or enforce the company's intellectual property rights could seriously detract from the time the company's management would otherwise devote to running its business. Intellectual property litigation relating to the company's products could cause its customers or potential customers to defer or limit their purchase or use of the affected products until resolution of the litigation.\nIf the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights or resolve successfully claims of infringement brought against it, the company's product sales and business could be affected adversely.\nThe company's business depends in part on its ability to establish, protect, safeguard and enforce its intellectual property and contractual rights and to defend against any claims of infringement, both of which involve complex legal, factual and marketplace uncertainties. The company relies on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark law and security measures to protect its intellectual property, but effective intellectual property protection may not be available in all places that the company sells its products or services, particularly in certain foreign jurisdictions, and patents provide protection for finite time periods. In addition, the company uses nondisclosure, confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with many of its employees, and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with certain third parties, in an effort to help protect its proprietary technology and know-how. If these agreements are breached or the company's intellectual property is otherwise infringed, misappropriated or violated, the company may have to rely on litigation to enforce its intellectual property rights. If any of these measures are unsuccessful in protecting the company's intellectual property, the company's business may be affected adversely.\nIn addition, the company may face claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of third parties' intellectual property that could interfere with its ability to use technology or other intellectual property rights that are material to the company's business operations. In the event that a claim of infringement, misappropriation or other violation against the company is successful, the company may be required to pay royalties or license fees to continue to use technology or other intellectual property rights that the company was using, or\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nthe company may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable time. If the company is unable to obtain licenses on reasonable terms, it may be forced to cease selling or using the products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, or to redesign or, in the case of trademark claims, rename its products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may not be possible, or if possible, may be time-consuming. Any litigation of this type, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to the company and adversely affect the company's business and financial condition.\nThe company also holds patent and other intellectual property licenses from third parties for some of its products and on technologies that are necessary in the design and manufacture of some of the company's products. The loss of these licenses could prevent the company from, or could cause additional disruption or expense in, manufacturing, marketing and selling these products, which could harm the company's business.\nManufacturing and Supply Risks\nDecreased availability or increased costs of materials could increase the company's costs of producing its products.\nThe company purchases raw materials, fabricated components, some finished goods and services from a variety of suppliers. Raw materials such as plastics, steel and aluminum, purchased electronics and other components are considered key raw materials. Where appropriate, the company employs contracts with its suppliers, both domestic and international. From time to time, however, the prices, availability, or quality of these materials fluctuate due to global market demands, import duties and tariffs, delays or interruptions in production or delivery, including ongoing shipping and logistics disruptions exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic or economic conditions, which could impair the company's ability to procure necessary materials or increase the cost of these materials. For example, global shortages of microprocessors for production of printed circuit boards have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on the company's ability to produce its products. Inflationary and other increases in costs of these materials have occurred in the past and may recur from time to time. In addition, freight costs associated with shipping and receiving product and sales are impacted by fluctuations in the cost of oil and gas. In addition, freight and transportation costs have been negatively impacted by the pandemic. A reduction in the supply or increase in the cost or change in quality of those materials or transportation costs, could impact the company's ability to manufacture\nits products and could increase the cost of production, which could negatively impact the company's revenues and profitability. For example, the tariffs on steel and aluminum on a wide range of products and components imported from China imposed by the U.S. as well as material cost increases imposed by domestic suppliers influenced by the tariffs, have had, and may continue to have, a significant adverse effect on the company's cost of product. The company is attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts of these tariffs, through identifying long-term alternative supply chain opportunities and other actions, including tariff exemptions which expired on January 1, 2021. The company's actions to date have greatly reduced the impact of tariffs. However, if the company is unsuccessful in mitigating the impact of tariffs in the future, its revenues, profitability and results of operations may continue to be adversely affected.\nInflationary economic conditions have increased, and may continue to increase, the company\u2019s costs of producing its products.\nThe company\u2019s products are manufactured using various metals and other commodity-based materials, including, steel and aluminum. Additionally, the company uses certain component parts, such as microprocessors, which may be in short supply and difficult or costly to obtain. Freight and labor costs also are significant elements of the company\u2019s production costs. Inflationary economic conditions increase these various costs. If the company is unable to mitigate inflationary increases through customer pricing actions, alternative supply arrangements or other cost reduction initiatives, its profitability may be adversely affected.\nThe company has fixed-price contracts with certain of its customers, which could subject the company to losses if it has cost overruns. While fixed price contracts enable the company to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject the company to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if the company is unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. This risk is further exacerbated when inflationary economic conditions persist.\nGeopolitical risks, such as those associated with Russia\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine, could result in increased market volatility and uncertainty, which could negatively impact the company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe uncertain nature, magnitude, and duration of hostilities stemming from Russia\u2019s recent military invasion of Ukraine, including the potential effects of sanctions limitations, retaliatory cyber-attacks on the world economy and markets, and potential shipping delays, have\nPart I Table of Contents\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\ncontributed to increased market volatility and uncertainty, which could have an adverse impact on macroeconomic factors that affect the company\u2019s business. As a result of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union governments, among others, have developed coordinated economic and financial sanctions packages. As the invasion of Ukraine continues, there can be no certainty regarding whether such governments or other governments will impose additional sanctions, or other economic or military measures against Russia.\nThe impact the invasion of Ukraine, including economic sanctions or additional war or military conflict, as well as potential responses to them by Russia, is currently unknown and they could adversely affect the company\u2019s business, supply chain, suppliers or customers. In addition, the continuation of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia could lead to other disruptions, instability and volatility in global markets and industries that could negatively impact the company\u2019s operations. It is not possible to predict the broader consequences of this conflict, which could include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, the availability of raw materials, supplies, freight and labor, currency exchange rates and financial markets, all of which could impact the company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe company's ability to manage an effective supply chain is a key success factor.\nThe company needs to manage its supply chain efficiently from sourcing to manufacturing and distribution. Successful supply chain management is based on building strong supplier relationships, built on conforming, quality products delivered on-time and at a fair price and operating efficiency. Cost reduction efforts depend on the company's execution of global and regional product platforms that create leverage in sourcing. If the company's supply chain management or cost reduction optimization efforts are ineffective, or if the supply chain continues to be adversely affected by disruption due to shortages, trade barriers or other factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the company's revenues and profitability can be negatively impacted.\nOther Regulatory and Litigation Risks\nThe company is subject to certain risks inherent in managing and operating businesses in many different foreign jurisdictions.\nThe company has significant international operations, including operations in Australia, Canada, New\nZealand, Mexico, Asia (primarily Thailand) and Europe. There are risks inherent in operating and selling products internationally, including:\n\u2022different regulatory environments and reimbursement systems;\n\u2022difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022foreign customers who may have longer payment cycles than customers in the United States;\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022tax rates in certain foreign countries that may exceed those in the United States and foreign earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements;\n\u2022the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other trade restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country;\n\u2022potential adverse changes in trade agreements between the United States and foreign countries, including the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA);\n\u2022potential adverse changes in economic and political conditions in countries where the company operates or where end-users of the company's products reside, or in their diplomatic relations with the United States;\n\u2022government control of capital transactions, including the borrowing of funds for operations or the expatriation of cash;\n\u2022potential adverse tax consequences, including those that may result from new United States tax laws, rules, regulations or policies;\n\u2022security concerns and potential business interruption risks associated with political and/or social unrest, or public health crisis, in foreign countries where the company's facilities or assets are located;\n\u2022the potential effects of geopolitical conflicts, such as the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, including retaliatory and regulatory actions, in response to such conflicts;\n\u2022difficulties associated with managing a large organization spread throughout various countries;\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n\u2022difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker intellectual property rights protection in some countries;\n\u2022required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and\n\u2022differing consumer product preferences.\nThe factors described above also could disrupt the company's product manufacturing and assembling operations or its key suppliers located outside of the United States or increase the cost to the company of conducting those operations or using those suppliers. For example, the company relies on its manufacturing operation in Mexico and suppliers in China and other countries to produce its products or components, and the global COVID-19 pandemic resulted in interruptions in production and supply of components and product on a global basis. Disruptions in, or increased costs related to, the company's foreign operations, particularly in Mexico, may impact the company's revenues and profitability. The factors described above also or the failure of the company to adequately comply with regulatory and legal requirements in foreign countries could adversely affect the company\u2019s ability to sell its products in those foreign countries or could subject the company to fines, penalties, or other adverse legal or regulatory enforcement.\nThe impact of \"Brexit\" may adversely affect the company.\nIn 2020, the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) exited the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d) and subsequently entered into a Free Trade Agreement with the EU. The company markets its main products in the UK, has contracts with the UK government and manufactures mattresses, seating and upholstery products in the UK. Changes in customs and value added tax accounting requirements have led to increased costs and logistical difficulties in delivering products into the UK. The company\u2019s operations in the UK are subject to UK regulatory requirements, which may diverge from EU requirements over time and lead to increased compliance costs. Brexit may increase the company's foreign exchange risk should the exchange rates between the British Pound and other currencies such as the U.S. Dollar and Euro materially change. The company has taken actions to mitigate such risks associated with Brexit but there is no assurance that its efforts will be entirely successful. If the company's mitigation efforts are not sufficient, the company's financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe company's products may be subject to product liability claims or recalls, which could be costly, harm the company's reputation and adversely affect its business.\nThe manufacture and sale of medical devices and related products exposes the company to a significant risk\nof product liability claims. From time to time, the company has been, and currently is, subject to a number of product liability claims alleging that the use of the company's products has resulted in serious injury or even death.\nEven if the company is successful in defending against any liability claims, these claims could nevertheless distract the company's management, result in substantial costs, harm the company's reputation, adversely affect the sales of all the company's products and otherwise harm the company's business. If there is a significant increase in the number of product liability claims, the company's business could be adversely affected.\nThe company is self-insured in North America for product liability exposures through its captive insurance company, Invatection Insurance Company, which currently has a policy year that runs from September 1 to August 31 and insures annual policy losses up to $10,000,000 per occurrence and $13,000,000 in the aggregate. The company also has additional layers of external insurance coverage, related to all lines of insurance coverage, insuring up to $75,000,000 in aggregate losses per policy year arising from individual claims anywhere in the world that exceed the captive insurance company policy limits or the limits of the company's per country foreign liability limits, as applicable. There can be no assurance that Invacare's current insurance levels will continue to be adequate or available at affordable rates.\nProduct liability reserves are recorded for individual claims based upon historical experience, industry expertise and indications from the third-party actuary. Additional reserves, in excess of the specific individual case reserves, are provided for incurred but not reported claims based upon actuarial valuations at the time such valuations are conducted. Historical claims experience and other assumptions are taken into consideration to estimate the ultimate reserves. For example, the actuarial analysis assumes that historical loss experience is an indicator of future experience, that the distribution of exposures by geographic area and nature of operations for ongoing operations is expected to be very similar to historical operations with no dramatic changes and that the government indices used to trend losses and exposures are appropriate. Estimates made are adjusted on a regular basis and can be impacted by actual loss awards and settlements on claims. While actuarial analysis is used to help determine adequate reserves, the company is responsible for the determination and recording of adequate reserves in accordance with accepted loss reserving standards and practices. If the company's reserves are not adequate to cover actual claims experience, the company's financial results could be adversely affected.\nPart I Table of Contents\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition, as a result of a product liability claim or if the company's products are alleged to be defective, the company may have to recall some of its products, may have to incur significant costs or may suffer harm to its business reputation.\nThe company is subject to ongoing medical device reporting regulations that require the company to report to the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries if the company's products cause, or contribute to, death or serious injury, or if they malfunction and would be likely to cause, or contribute to, death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. If a deficiency, defect in design or manufacturing or defect in labeling is discovered, the company may voluntarily elect to recall or correct the company's products. In addition, the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries could force the company to do a field correction or recall of the company's products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacturing. A government mandated or voluntary recall or field correction by the company could occur for various reasons, such as component failures, manufacturing errors or design defects, including defects in labeling. Any recall or field correction could divert managerial and financial resources and could harm the company's reputation with its customers, product users and the health care professionals that use, prescribe and recommend the company's products. The company could have product recalls or field actions that result in significant costs to the company in the future, and these actions could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. The company could have difficulty in implementing product recalls or field corrections in countries in which the company lacks adequate resources, facilities or personnel, and the failure to comply with the recall or field correction requirements of foreign governmental authorities could have an adverse impact on the company.\nOther Risk Factors - Other Financial Risks, Risks Related to Employees and the Company's Common Shares\nThe company has long-term finance leases on significant facilities which can affect the company's liquidity and cash flow.\nUnder the terms of the real estate leases for the company\u2019s facilities in Elyria and North Ridgeville, Ohio, and Sanford, Florida, defaults by the company under any one of such leases, would trigger a cross default under all related leases with the owner/landlord. The company also has a finance lease for its Albstadt, Germany facility. Should a default by the company occur, there could be a material adverse effect on the company's business, operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nThe company's revenues and profits are subject to exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations which can affect the company's profitability and cash flow.\nCurrency exchange rates are subject to fluctuation due to, among other things, changes in local, regional or global economic conditions, the imposition of currency exchange restrictions and unexpected changes in regulatory or taxation environments. The predominant currency used by the company's subsidiaries outside the U.S. to transact business is the functional currency used for each subsidiary. Through the company's international operations, the company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in exchange rates can have a significant impact on net sales and elements of cost. The company conducts a significant number of transactions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, because certain of the company's costs and revenues are denominated in other currencies, such as those from its European operations, the company's results of operations are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of those operations are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. For example, in prior years, the devaluation of the Euro had a negative impact on the translation of company's European segment net income into U.S. dollars, and the foreign currency impact of Brexit in the U.K. had a negative impact on acquisition of dollar and Euro denominated goods in the U.K. If other countries also exit the European Union, similar negative impacts may result. In addition, in light of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting tensions between the European Union, other European countries, as well as the United States, with Russia, any resulting material change to the valuation of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar could adversely impact the company's operating results.\nThe company uses foreign exchange forward contracts primarily to help reduce its exposure to transactional exchange rate risk. Despite the company's efforts to mitigate these risks, however, the company's revenues and profitability may be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations. The company does not have any similar arrangements that mitigate the company's exposure to foreign exchange translation risk and does not believe that any meaningful arrangement to do so is available to the company.\nThe company also is exposed to market risk through various financial instruments, including fixed rate and floating rate debt instruments. The company does at times use interest rate swap contracts to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations, but those efforts may not adequately protect the company from significant interest rate risks. Interest on some of the company's debt was based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nhas transitioned to being based primarily on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). These interest rates have been historically low. Increases in SOFR could have a significant impact on the company's reported interest expense, to the extent that the company has outstanding borrowings subject to SOFR-based interest rates.\nAdditional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect the company's future profitability and cash flow.\nThe company is subject to income taxes in the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. The domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the allocation of income among these different jurisdictions. The company's tax expense includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various other estimates and assumptions. In addition, the assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets. The company's future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the company's effective tax rate which could result from changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of its tax exposures. Corporate tax reform and tax law changes continue to be analyzed in many jurisdictions, including the potential impacts of new United States tax laws, rules, regulations or policies, and any legislation or regulations which may result from those policies.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act significantly revamped U.S. taxation of corporations, including a reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a limitation on interest deductibility, and a new tax regime for foreign earnings. The limitation on interest deductibility, the new U.S. taxes on accumulated and future foreign earnings, other adverse changes resulting from the Tax Act, or a change in the mix of domestic and foreign earnings, might offset the benefit from the reduced tax rate, and the company's future effective tax rates and/or cash taxes may increase, even significantly, or not decrease much, compared to recent or historical trends. Many of the provisions of the Tax Act are highly complex and may be subject to further interpretive guidance from the IRS or others. Some of the provisions of the Tax Act may be changed by a future Congress or challenged by the World Trade Organization (\u201cWTO\u201d) or be subject to trade or tax retaliation by other countries. Although the company\ncannot predict the nature or outcome of such future interpretive guidance, or actions by a future Congress, WTO or other countries, they could adversely impact the company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe company's net operating losses, foreign tax credits and interest carryforwards may be limited for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nIf a corporation with net operating losses, foreign tax credit carryforwards and interest carryforwards (\"Tax Attributes Carryforwards\") undergoes an \"ownership change\" within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), then such corporation's use of such \"pre-change\" Tax Attributes Carryforwards to offset income incurred following such ownership change generally will be subject to an annual limitation specified in Section 382. Such limitation also may apply to certain losses or deductions that are \"built-in\" (i.e., attributable to periods prior to the ownership change, but not yet taken into account for tax purposes) as of the date of the ownership change that are subsequently recognized. An ownership change generally occurs when there is either (i) a shift in ownership involving one or more \"5% shareholders,\" or (ii) and \"equity structure shift\" and, as a result, the percentage of stock of such corporation owned by one or more 5% shareholders (based on value) has increased by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage stock of such corporation owned by shareholders during the \"testing period\" (generally the three years preceding the testing date). If the use of the company's Tax Attributes Carryforwards to offset income is subject to such an annual limitation, it is possible that cash flows, business operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. Based on information that is publicly available, the company believes that a Section 382 ownership change has not occurred as of December 31, 2021. We will update our analysis prior to using our tax attributes.\nThe company's reported results may be adversely affected by increases in reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable.\nThe company has a large balance of accounts receivable and has established a reserve for the portion of such accounts receivable that the company estimates will not be collected because of the company's customers' non-payment. The specific reserve is based on historical trends and a general reserve is recorded to capture macroeconomic trends.\nPart I Table of Contents\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe inability to attract and retain, or loss of the services of, the company's key management and personnel could adversely affect its ability to operate the company's business.\nThe company's future success will depend, in part, upon the continued service of key managerial, engineering, marketing, sales and technical and operational personnel. In addition, the company's future success will depend on its ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, including personnel experienced in sales, supply chain, marketing and manufacturing of medical equipment and in quality systems and regulatory affairs. If the company is not successful in retaining its current personnel or in hiring or retaining qualified personnel in the future, the company's business may be adversely affected. The company's future success depends, to a significant extent, on the abilities and efforts of its executive officers and other members of its management team, such as the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and its Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as well as other members of its management team. The company had significant turnover in personnel in recent years and has had years in which annual bonuses and incentive compensation have not been earned and paid, and as a result, the company cannot be certain it can adequately recruit, hire and retain personnel or that its executive officers and other key employees will continue in their respective capacities for any period of time, and these employees may be difficult to replace. If the company loses the services of any of its management team or other key personnel, the company's business may be adversely affected.\nVolatility in the market price of the company's common shares could adversely affect its shareholders, its ability to finance operations or attract and retain leadership.\nThe market price of the company's common shares may be influenced by lower trading volume and concentrated ownership relative to many other publicly-held companies. Because several of the company's shareholders own significant amounts of the company's outstanding common shares, the common shares are relatively less liquid and therefore more susceptible to price fluctuations than many other companies' shares. If any one or more of these shareholders were to sell all or a portion of their holdings of company common shares at once or within short periods of time, or there was an expectation that such a sale was imminent, then the market price of the company's common shares could be negatively affected.\nPart I", "PERMNO": 45728, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "IVC"}
