{"cik": "1412665", "company": "MidWestOne Financial Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-06", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The value or market price of our securities could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nEconomic and Market Risks\nOur business is concentrated in and largely dependent upon the continued growth and welfare of the Iowa and Minneapolis/St. Paul markets.\nWe operate primarily in the central and eastern Iowa and Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota markets and their surrounding communities in the upper-Midwest. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are significantly impacted by changes in the economic conditions in those areas. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in these markets. Although our customers\u2019 businesses and financial interests may extend well beyond these market areas, adverse economic conditions that affect these market areas could reduce our growth rate, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us, affect the value of collateral underlying loans and generally affect our financial condition and results of operations. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability of increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; uncertainty in U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs; natural disasters; acts of war or terrorism; widespread disease or pandemics; or a combination of these or other factors. Because of our geographic concentration, we are less able than other regional or national financial institutions to diversify our credit risks across multiple markets.\nWeather-related events and other natural disasters, as well as man-made disasters, could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on financial results and condition.\nA significant portion of our operations are located in areas that are susceptible to floods, droughts, tornadoes and other severe weather events. Any of these, or any other severe weather event, could cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations or financial condition. While we maintain insurance covering many of these weather-related events, including coverage for lost profits and extra expense, there is no insurance against the disruption that a severe weather event could produce to the markets that we serve and the resulting adverse impact on our borrowers to timely repay their loans and the value of any collateral held by us. The severity and impact of weather-\nrelated events are difficult to predict and may be exacerbated by global climate change.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk, which could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability.\nShifts in short-term interest rates may reduce our net interest income, which is the principal component of our earnings. Net interest income is the difference between the amounts received by us on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid by us on our interest-bearing liabilities. When interest rates rise, the rate of interest we pay on our liabilities, such as deposits, may rise more quickly than the rate of interest that we receive on our interest-earning assets, such as loans, which could cause our profits to decrease. The impact on earnings can be adverse when the slope of the yield curve flattens, that is, when short-term interest rates increase more than long-term interest rates or when long-term interest rates decrease more than short-term interest rates.\nChanges in interest rates also can affect the value of loans, securities and other assets. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Further, when we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. Subsequently, we continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets would have an adverse impact on net interest income.\nRising interest rates will likely result in a decline in value of our fixed-rate debt securities. Any unrealized losses resulting from holding available for sale securities are recognized in other comprehensive income (or net income, if the decline is other-than- temporary), and reduce total shareholders\u2019 equity. Unrealized losses do not negatively impact our regulatory capital ratios; however, tangible common equity and the associated ratios used by many investors would be reduced. If debt securities in an unrealized loss position are sold, such losses become realized and will reduce our regulatory capital ratios.\nIn late 2015, the Federal Reserve\u2019s Open Market Committee began the process of raising short-term interest rates from near-zero levels, and the Federal Reserve raised the target federal funds rate by 100 basis points in 2018 and 75 basis points in 2017. In 2019, the Federal Reserve decreased the federal funds rate by 75 basis points. If the Federal Reserve increases the federal funds rate and short-term interest rates subsequently increase and long-term interest rates do not rise, or increase but at a slower rate, we could experience net interest margin compression as our rates on interest-earning assets decline measured relative to rates on our interest-bearing liabilities. Any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our net interest income and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe measure interest rate risk under various rate scenarios and using specific criteria and assumptions. A summary of this process, along with the results of our net interest income simulations, is included at Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under \u201cInterest Rate Risk.\u201d Although we believe our current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable and effectively managed, significant fluctuations in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nWe are subject to risk concerning the discontinuance of LIBOR.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. LIBOR makes up one of the most common interest rate indices in the world and is commonly referenced in financial instruments. We have exposure to LIBOR in various aspects through our financial contracts. Instruments that may be impacted include loans, securities, deposits, subordinated debentures and derivatives, among\nother financial contracts indexed to LIBOR and that mature after December 31, 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\") has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR, and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR.\nGiven the extensive use of LIBOR across financial markets the transition to an alternative rate presents various risks that could adversely impact the value of and return on the Company\u2019s existing instruments and contracts. In particular, any such transition could:\n\u2022\nadversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, the revenue and expenses associated with, and the value of our floating-rate obligations, loans, securities, deposits, subordinated debentures, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u2022\nprompt inquiries or other actions from regulators with respect to our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate;\n\u2022\nresult in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language, or lack of fallback language, in LIBOR-based instruments; and\n\u2022\nrequire the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark, such as SOFR.\nThe manner and impact of this transition, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain.\nCredit and Lending Risks\nWe must manage our credit risk effectively.\nThere are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, risks of nonpayment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and cash flows available to service debt and risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions. We attempt to minimize our credit risk through prudent loan application approval procedures, careful monitoring of the concentration of our loans within specific industries and periodic independent reviews of outstanding loans by our credit review department. We periodically examine our credit process and implement changes to improve our procedures and standards. However, we cannot assure you that such approval and monitoring procedures will reduce these credit risks. If the overall economic climate in the United States, generally, or our market areas, specifically, declines, or even if it does not, our borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans, and the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require increases in the provision for loan losses, which would cause our net income and return on equity to decrease.\nThe small to mid-sized businesses that we lend to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business developments, which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan.\nWe primarily serve the banking and financial services needs of small to mid-sized businesses. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, and may experience volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small and medium-sized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two people or a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loan. Should the economic conditions negatively impact the markets in which we operate, our borrowers may experience financial difficulties, and the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise, which could negatively impact our business.\nOur loan portfolio has a significant concentration of commercial real estate loans, which involve risks specific to real estate value.\nCommercial real estate lending comprises a significant portion of our lending business. Specifically, commercial real estate loans were $1.81 billion, or approximately 52.6% of our total loan portfolio, as of December 31, 2019. Of this amount, $583.6 million, or approximately 16.9% of our total loan portfolio, were loans secured by owner-occupied property, and $1.23 billion, or approximately 35.7% of our total loan portfolio, were secured by non-owner occupied property. The market value of real estate securing our commercial real estate loans can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in\nthe geographic area in which the real estate is located. Although a significant portion of such loans is secured by real estate as a secondary form of repayment, adverse developments affecting real estate values in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio. Additionally, real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of the loans generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic events or governmental regulations outside of the control of the borrower or lender could negatively impact the future cash flow and market values of the affected properties.\nIf problems develop in the commercial real estate sector, particularly within one or more of our markets, the value of collateral securing our commercial real estate loans could decline. In such case, we may not be able to realize the amount of security that we anticipated at the time of originating the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and/or capital. In light of the continued general uncertainty that exists in the economy and credit markets nationally, we may experience deterioration in the performance of our commercial real estate loan customers.\nCommercial, industrial and agricultural loans make up a significant portion of our loan portfolio.\nCommercial, industrial and agricultural loans (including credit cards and commercially related overdrafts) were $975.7 million, or approximately 28.3% of our total loan portfolio, as of December 31, 2019. Our commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most often, this collateral is accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation value of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any exists. As a result, in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing these loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. In addition, if the U.S. economy declines, this could harm the businesses of our commercial and industrial customers and reduce the value of the collateral securing these loans.\nPayments on agricultural loans are dependent on the successful operation or management of the farm property. The success of the farm may be affected by many factors outside the control of the borrower, including adverse weather conditions that prevent the planting of a crop or limit crop yields, such as hail, drought and floods (although borrowers may attempt to mitigate this risk by purchasing crop insurance), loss of livestock due to disease or other factors, declines in market prices for agricultural products both domestically and internationally, and the impact of government regulations, including changes in price supports, subsidies, tariffs, trade agreements, and environmental regulations. In addition, many farms are dependent on a limited number of key individuals whose injury or death may significantly affect the successful operation of the farm. If the cash flow from a farming operation is diminished, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. The primary crops in our market areas are corn and soybeans. Accordingly, adverse circumstances affecting these crops could have an adverse effect on our agricultural portfolio. Likewise, agricultural operating loans involve a greater degree of risk than lending on residential properties, particularly in the case of loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as farm equipment or assets such as livestock or crops. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio.\nWe establish our reserve or \u201callowance\u201d for loan losses at a level considered appropriate by management to absorb probable loan losses based on an analysis of the portfolio, market environment and other factors we deem relevant. The allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based upon relevant information available to us. The allowance contains an allocation for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships, as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified. Additions to the allowance for loan losses, which are charged to earnings through the provision for loan losses, are determined based on a variety of factors, including an analysis of the loan portfolio, historical loss experience and an evaluation of current economic conditions in our market areas. In addition, as a result of the implementation of CECL, the allowance for loan losses will reflect new or updated assumptions, model, and methods for estimating the allowance for loan losses to determine expected credit losses. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Although management has established an allowance for loan losses it believes is adequate to absorb probable and reasonably estimable losses in our loan portfolio, the allowance may not be adequate. We could sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the amount of our allowance for loan losses. Higher loan losses could arise for a variety of reasons,\nincluding changes in economic, operating and other conditions within our markets, as well as changes in the financial condition, cash flows, and operations of our borrowers.\nAt December 31, 2019, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total gross loans was 0.84% and as a percentage of total nonperforming loans was approximately 63.23%. Although management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to absorb probable loan losses on any existing loans that may become uncollectible, we cannot predict loan losses with certainty, and we cannot assure you that our allowance for loan losses will prove sufficient to cover actual loan losses in the future. We may be required to make additional provisions for loan losses in the future to supplement the allowance for loan losses, either due to management\u2019s decision to do so, as a result of the implementation of CECL, or because our banking regulators require us to do so. If we experience significant charge-offs in future periods or charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, we may need additional provisions to replenish the allowance for loan losses. An increase in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and, most likely, capital, and may have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Loan losses in excess of our reserves may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and could result in further losses in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our nonperforming loans, which includes nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, and loans modified under troubled debt restructurings, and excludes purchased credit impaired loans, totaled $46.0 million, or 1.33% of our loan portfolio, and our nonperforming assets, which include nonperforming loans plus foreclosed assets, net, totaled $49.7 million, or 1.44% of loans. In addition, we had $11.6 million in accruing loans (not included in the nonperforming loan totals) that were 31-89 days delinquent as of December 31, 2019.\nOur nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans or foreclosed assets, thereby adversely affecting our net income and returns on assets and equity, increasing our loan administration costs and adversely affecting our efficiency ratio. When we take collateral in foreclosure and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the collateral to its then-fair market value, which may result in a loss. These nonperforming loans and foreclosed assets also increase our risk profile and the capital our regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks. The resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant time commitments from management and can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. If we experience increases in nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets, our net interest income may be negatively impacted and our loan administration costs could increase, each of which could have an adverse effect on our net income and related ratios, such as return on assets and equity.\nWe may encounter issues with environmental law compliance if we take possession, through foreclosure or otherwise, of the real property that secures a loan.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. In the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property's value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCapital & Liquidity Risks\nLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our most important source of funds consists of customer deposits. Deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, provide a better risk/return trade-off. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we could lose a relatively low cost source of funds, which would require us to seek other, potentially higher cost funding alternatives. Other primary sources of funds consist of cash from operations, investment securities maturities and sales, and funds from sales of our stock. Additional liquidity is provided by brokered deposits, bank lines of credit, repurchase agreements and the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities or on terms that are\nacceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, pay our expenses, pay dividends to our shareholders, or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may desire or be required to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We intend to grow our business organically and to explore opportunities to grow our business by taking advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities, and such growth plans may require us to raise additional capital to ensure that we have adequate levels of capital to support such growth on top of our current operations. In order to accommodate future capital needs, we maintain a universal shelf registration statement, which allows for future sale up to $100 million of securities. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital, if needed or desired, on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed or desired, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth or acquisitions could be materially impaired.\nDowngrades in the credit rating of one or more insurers that provide credit enhancement for our state and municipal securities portfolio may have an adverse impact on the market for, and valuation of, these types of securities.\nWe invest in tax-exempt and taxable state and local municipal securities, some of which are insured by monoline insurers. As of December 31, 2019, we had $257.2 million of municipal securities (recorded values), which represented 32.7% of our total securities portfolio. Following the onset of the financial crisis, several of these insurers came under scrutiny by rating agencies. Even though management generally purchases municipal securities on the overall credit strength of the issuer, the reduction in the credit rating of an insurer may negatively impact the market for and valuation of our investment securities. Such a downgrade could adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to pay dividends is subject to certain limitations and restrictions, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue paying the same level of dividends in the future that we have paid in the past or that we will be able to pay future dividends at all.\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited by regulatory restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us is limited by its obligations to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity and by other general restrictions on dividends that are applicable to the Bank, including the requirement under the Iowa Banking Act that the Bank may not pay dividends in excess of its undivided profits. If these regulatory requirements are not met, the Bank will not be able to pay dividends to us, and we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.\nIn addition, as a bank holding company, our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends. The Federal Reserve guidelines generally require us to review the effects of the cash payment of dividends on common stock and other Tier 1 capital instruments (i.e., perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred debt) in light of our earnings, capital adequacy and financial condition. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve indicates that the board of directors of a bank holding company (including a financial holding company) should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the company\u2019s dividends if:\n\u2022\nthe company\u2019s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;\n\u2022\nthe prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company\u2019s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or\n\u2022\nthe company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.\nAlso, banking institutions that do not maintain a capital conservation buffer, comprised of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, greater than 2.5% above the regulatory minimum capital requirements will face constraints on the payment of dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall, unless prior regulatory approval is obtained. Accordingly, if the Bank fails to maintain the applicable minimum capital ratios and the capital conservation buffer, distributions to the Company may be prohibited or limited, and if the Company fails to maintain the applicable minimum capital\nratios and the capital conservation buffer, distributions to or stock repurchases from the Company\u2019s shareholders may be prohibited or limited.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $41.6 million of junior subordinated debentures held by three statutory business trusts that we control. Interest payments on the debentures, which totaled $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, must be paid before we pay dividends on our capital stock, including our common stock. We have the right to defer interest payments on the debentures for up to 20 consecutive quarters. However, if we elect to defer interest payments, all deferred interest must be paid before we may pay dividends on our capital stock.\nWe have counterparty risk, and therefore, we may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be negatively affected by the actions and the soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are generally interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, credit or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and regularly engage in transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional customers. Many of these transactions may expose us to credit or other risks if another financial institution experiences adverse circumstances. In certain circumstances, the collateral that we hold may be insufficient to fully cover the risk that a counterparty defaults on its obligations, which may cause us to experience losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetitive and Strategic Risks\nWe face intense competition in all phases of our business from banks and other financial institutions.\nThe banking and financial services businesses in our markets are highly competitive. Our competitors include large regional banks, local community banks, savings and loan associations, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, money market mutual funds, small local credit unions as well as large aggressive and expansion-minded credit unions, fintech companies, and other non-bank financial services providers. Many of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as we are. Many of our unregulated competitors compete across geographic boundaries and are able to provide customers with a competitive alternative to traditional banking services.\nIncreased competition in our markets may result in a decrease in the amounts of our loans and deposits, reduced spreads between loan rates and deposit rates or loan terms that are more favorable to the borrower. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and remain profitable. If increased competition causes us to significantly discount the interest rates we offer on loans or increase the amount we pay on deposits, our net interest income could be adversely impacted. If increased competition causes us to modify our underwriting standards, we could be exposed to higher losses from lending activities. Additionally, many of our competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets, have larger lending limits and offer a broader range of financial services than we can offer.\nConsumers and businesses are increasingly using non-banks to complete their financial transactions, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing consumers and businesses to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods. For example, the wide acceptance of Internet-based commerce has resulted in a number of alternative payment processing systems and lending platforms in which banks play only minor roles. Customers can now maintain funds in prepaid debit cards or digital currencies, and pay bills and transfer funds directly without the direct assistance of banks. The diminishing role of banks as financial intermediaries has resulted and could continue to result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the potential loss of lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a continuing need for technological change, and we may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology.\nThe financial services industry continues to undergo rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to enabling us to better serve our customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and the potential for cost reduction. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability, both internally and through our core processor, to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow our market share. Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As a result,\nthey may be able to offer additional or superior products to those that we will be able to offer, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, we cannot provide you with assurance that we will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our customers.\nWe may be adversely affected by risks associated with completed and potential acquisitions, including execution risks, failure to realize anticipated transaction benefits, and failure to overcome integration risks, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nWe plan to continue to grow our businesses organically but remain open to considering potential bank or other acquisition opportunities that make financial and strategic sense. In the event that we do pursue acquisitions, we may have difficulty executing on acquisitions and may not realize the anticipated benefits of any transaction we complete. Any of the foregoing matters could materially and adversely affect us.\nIn any acquisition that we complete, such as the acquisition of ATBancorp, we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated transaction benefits if the integration process takes longer or is more costly than expected or otherwise fails to meet our expectations. Acquisition activities could be material to our business and involve a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nWe may incur time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in our attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business.\n\u2022\nWe are exposed to potential asset and credit quality risks and unknown or contingent liabilities of the banks or businesses we acquire. If these issues or liabilities exceed our estimates, our earnings, capital and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\n\u2022\nThe acquisition of other entities generally requires integration of systems, procedures and personnel of the acquired entity. This integration process is complicated and time consuming and can also be disruptive to the customers and employees of the acquired business and our business. If the integration process is not conducted successfully, we may not realize the anticipated economic benefits of acquisitions within the expected time frame, or ever, and we may lose customers or employees of the acquired business. We may also experience greater than anticipated customer losses even if the integration process is successful.\n\u2022\nTo finance an acquisition, we may borrow funds or pursue other forms of financing, such as issuing convertible preferred stock, which may have high dividend rates or may be highly dilutive to holders of our common stock, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or issuing capital stock, which could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders.\n\u2022\nWe may be unsuccessful in realizing the anticipated benefits from acquisitions. For example, we may not be successful in realizing anticipated cost savings. We also may not be successful in preventing disruptions in service to existing customer relationships of the acquired institution, which could lead to a loss in revenues.\nIn addition to the foregoing, we may face additional risks in acquisitions to the extent we acquire new lines of business or new products, or enter new geographic areas, in which we have little or no current experience, especially if we lose key employees of the acquired operations. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. Our inability to overcome risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully implement our acquisition growth strategy and grow our business and profitability.\nAccounting and Tax Risks\nWe are subject to changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines.\nOur financial performance is impacted by accounting principles, policies and guidelines. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses.\nFrom time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards, such as the implementation of CECL, or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in these standards are continuously occurring, and given recent economic conditions, more drastic changes may occur. The implementation of such changes, such as CECL, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA new accounting standard may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FASB adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Company and the Bank for our first fiscal year after December 15, 2019. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, requires financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This changes the prior method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and has required us to greatly increase the types of data we need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. The actual impact of CECL depends on the characteristics of our financial instruments, economic conditions, and our economic and loss forecasts at the adoption date. The use of economic forecasting may increase the volatility of our allowance for loan losses and our earnings. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax law and may not realize tax benefits which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws at national or state levels could have an effect on the Company\u2019s short-term and long-term earnings. Tax law changes are both difficult to predict and are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Changes in tax laws could affect the Company\u2019s earnings as well as its customers\u2019 financial positions, or both. Changes in tax laws could also require the revaluation of the Company\u2019s net deferred tax position, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, current portions of the Company\u2019s net deferred tax assets relate to tax-effected state net operating loss carry-forwards, the utilization of which may be further limited in the event of certain material changes in the Company\u2019s ownership.\nIn addition, changes in ownership could further limit the Company\u2019s realization of deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods prior to the expiration of the related net operating losses and the limitation of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d). Section 382 of the Code contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating loss carry-forwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. The Company issued a significant amount of common stock in connection with the acquisition of Central Bancshares, Inc. (\u201cCentral\u201d) in 2015 and the acquisition of ATBancorp in 2019. While the issuance of stock does not affect an ownership change under Section 382, it may make it more likely that an ownership change under Section 382 will occur in the future. If the Company undergoes an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 as a result of future transactions involving our common stock, our ability to use net operating loss carry-forwards, tax credit carry-forwards or net unrealized built-in losses at the time of ownership change would be subject to the limitations of Section 382. The limitation may affect the amount of the Company\u2019s deferred income tax asset and, depending on the limitation, a portion of its built-in losses. Net operating loss carry-forwards or tax credit carry-forwards could expire before the Company would be able to use them. This could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nOperational Risks\nWe face the risk of possible future goodwill impairment.\nWe performed a valuation analysis of our goodwill, which increased to $91.9 million as a result of our acquisition of ATBancorp, as of October 1, 2019, which indicated no impairment existed. We will be required to perform additional goodwill impairment assessments on at least an annual basis, and perhaps more frequently, which could result in goodwill impairment charges. Any future goodwill impairment charge on the current goodwill balance, or future goodwill arising out of acquisitions that we are required to take, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by reducing our net income or increasing our net losses.\nWe could recognize losses on securities held in our securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the fair value of our securities portfolio was approximately $786.0 million. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. For example, fixed-rate securities acquired by us are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities, and instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause an other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer\nand any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain management and key personnel may affect future growth and earnings.\nMuch of our success and growth has been influenced by our ability to attract and retain management experienced in banking and financial services and familiar with the communities in our market areas. Our ability to retain our executive officers, current management teams, branch managers and loan officers will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategy. It is also critical, as we grow, to be able to attract and retain qualified additional management and loan officers with the appropriate level of experience and knowledge about our market areas to implement our operating strategy. The Dodd-Frank Act also directs the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives. These rules, when adopted, may make it more difficult to attract and retain the people we need to operate our businesses and limit our ability to promote our objectives through our compensation and incentive programs. The unexpected loss of services of any key management personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of our information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nAs a bank, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or our client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our clients, litigation or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us or our clients, denial or degradation of service attacks and malware or other cyber-attacks.\nThere continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. Several large corporations, including financial institutions and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their customers and employees and subjecting them to potential fraudulent activity. Some of our clients may have been affected by these breaches, which could increase their risks of identity theft and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us.\nInformation pertaining to us and our clients is maintained, and transactions are executed, on networks and systems maintained by us and certain third party partners, such as our online banking, mobile banking or accounting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our clients against fraud and security breaches and to maintain the confidence of our clients. Breaches of information security also may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our systems or the confidential information of our clients, including employees. In addition, increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our clients and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our clients to access our systems. Our third party partners\u2019 inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in a number of negative events, including losses to us or our clients, loss of business or clients, damage to our reputation, the incurrence of additional expenses, disruption to our business, additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses.\nWe depend on information technology and telecommunications systems of third parties, and any systems failures, interruptions or data breaches involving these systems could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems, third party servicers, accounting systems, mobile and online banking platforms and financial intermediaries. We outsource to third parties many of our major systems, such as data processing and mobile and online banking.\nThe failure of these systems, or the termination of a third party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third party systems fail or experience interruptions. A system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process loans or gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, result in potential noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, failures of third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or fraud or misconduct on the part of employees of any of these third parties, could disrupt our operations or adversely affect our reputation.\nIt may be difficult for us to replace some of our third party vendors, particularly vendors providing our core banking and information services, in a timely manner if they are unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future for any reason, and even if we are able to replace them, it may be at higher cost or result in the loss of customers. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of information and the monitoring of a large number of transactions on a minute-by-minute basis, and even a short interruption in service could have significant consequences. We also interact with and rely on retailers, for whom we process transactions, as well as financial counterparties and regulators. Each of these third parties may be targets of the same types of fraudulent activity, computer break-ins and other cybersecurity breaches described above, and the cybersecurity measures that they maintain to mitigate the risk of such activity may be different than our own and may be inadequate.\nAs a result of financial entities and technology systems becoming more interdependent and complex, a cyber incident, information breach or loss, or technology failure that compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including ourselves. As a result of the foregoing, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\nEmployee errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, and if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, compensation risk, legal and compliance risk, and reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. Our ability to successfully identify and manage risks facing us is an important factor that can significantly impact our results. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nOur internal controls may be ineffective.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information provided by customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. In deciding whether to extend credit, we may rely upon our customers' representations that their financial statements conform to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. We also may rely on customer representations and certifications, or other audit or accountants' reports, with respect to the business and financial condition of our clients. Our financial condition, results of operations, financial reporting and reputation could be negatively affected if we rely on materially misleading, false, inaccurate or fraudulent information.\nOur reputation could be damaged by negative publicity.\nReputational risk, or the risk to our business, financial condition or results of operations from negative publicity, is inherent in our business. Negative publicity can result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, inadequate protection of customer data, or ethical behavior of our employees, and from actions taken by regulators, ratings agencies and others as a result of that conduct. Damage to our reputation could impact our ability to attract new or maintain existing loan and deposit customers, employees and business relationships.\nRegulatory Risks\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, and the laws and regulations to which we are subject, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation by multiple regulatory agencies. These regulations may affect the manner and terms of delivery of our services. If we do not comply with governmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits or material restrictions on our businesses in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred, which may adversely affect our business operations. Changes in these regulations can significantly affect the services that we provide, as well as our costs of compliance with such regulations. These regulations may be impacted by the political ideologies of the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government as well as the heads of regulatory and administrative agencies, which may change as a result of elections. In addition, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements could affect our ability to attract and retain customers.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to stringent capital and liquidity requirements.\nAs a result of the implementation of the Basel III Rules, we were required to meet new and increased capital requirements beginning on January 1, 2015. In addition, beginning in 2016, banking institutions that do not maintain a capital conservation buffer, comprised of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, greater than 2.5% above the regulatory minimum capital requirements face constraints on the payment of dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall, unless prior regulatory approval is obtained. Accordingly, if the Bank or the Company fails to maintain the applicable minimum capital ratios and the capital conservation buffer, distributions by the Bank to the Company, or dividends or stock repurchases by the Company, may be prohibited or limited.\nFuture increases in minimum capital requirements could adversely affect our net income. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with the minimum capital requirements, our failure could result in our regulators taking formal or informal actions against us which could restrict our future growth or operations.\nFederal and state regulators periodically examine our business, and we may be required to remediate adverse examination findings.\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Iowa Division periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil money penalties, to fine or remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and\nplace our bank into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory action against us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe CRA requires our bank, consistent with safe and sound operations, to ascertain and meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income areas. Our bank\u2019s failure to comply with the CRA could, among other things, result in the denial or delay of certain corporate applications filed by us or our bank, including applications for branch openings or relocations and applications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or holding company. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations prohibit discriminatory lending practices by financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice, federal banking agencies, and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A challenge to an institution\u2019s compliance with fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nNon-compliance with the USA Patriot Act, the Bank Secrecy Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions against us.\nThe USA Patriot Act and the Bank Secrecy Act require financial institutions to design and implement programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Federal and state bank regulators also have focused on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. In recent years, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, these policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCommon Stock Risks\nThere is a limited trading market for our common shares, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nAlthough our common shares are listed for quotation on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the trading in our common shares has substantially less liquidity than many other companies listed on Nasdaq. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common shares at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. We cannot assure you that the volume of trading in our common shares will increase in the future.\nThe stock market can be volatile, and fluctuations in our operating results and other factors could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe stock market has experienced, and may continue to experience, fluctuations that significantly impact the market prices of securities issued by many companies. Market fluctuations could adversely affect our stock price. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, loss of investor confidence, interest rate changes, government shutdowns, trade wars, or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Moreover, our operating results may fluctuate and vary from period to period due to the risk factors set forth herein. As a result, period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our stock price could fluctuate significantly in response to our quarterly or annual results, annual projections and the impact of these risk factors on our operating results or financial position.\nCertain shareholders own a significant interest in the company and may exercise their control in a manner detrimental to your interests.\nCertain MidWestOne shareholders who are descendants of our founder collectively control approximately 17.4% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, certain MidWestOne shareholders that previously owned ATBancorp collectively control approximately 23.9% of our outstanding common stock. These shareholders may have the opportunity to exert influence on the outcome of matters required to be submitted to shareholders for approval. In addition, the significant level of ownership by these shareholders may contribute to the rather limited liquidity of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.", "PERMNO": 92593, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MOFG"}
