These statements are based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition and liquidity. Words that identify\nforward-looking statements include words such as \"may,\" \"could,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"possible,\" \"plan,\" \"predict,\" \"forecast,\" \"potential,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"may impact,\" \"on track,\" \"goal,\" \"strategy\" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance, an acquisition or our businesses. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. Those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements. Some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements include the risks discussed below.\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties discussed below that could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material may also materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nCurrent economic and political conditions make tax rules in jurisdictions subject to significant change: Our future results of operations could be affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings. In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law in the United States. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of tax reform as new guidance and regulations are published. In addition, further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise, including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has issued recommendations that, in some cases, would make substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax positions and principles. These contemplated changes, to the extent adopted by OECD members and/or other countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes.\nThe impact of United States healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain: In 2010 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted. While the provisions of the ACA are intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality of healthcare over time, other provisions of the legislation, including Medicare provisions aimed at decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, are having a meaningful effect on the way healthcare is developed and delivered and could have a significant effect on our business. There have been ongoing judicial and congressional efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the ACA. Among other things, the ACA imposed a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices that applies only to United States sales, which are a majority of our medical device sales. Congress suspended the excise tax for 2016 and 2017 and the suspension was once again upheld in January 2018 for two years. In December 2019, the excise tax was permanently repealed. We face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the ACA, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect\nDollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\nSTRYKER CORPORATION 2019 FORM 10-K\nof any future legislation or regulation in the United States may have on our business.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the classification, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and sale of our products: The classification, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive and evolving regulations and rigorous regulatory enforcement by the FDA, European Union (EU), the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China, and other governmental authorities in the United States and internationally. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances and/or approvals to market and sell our products can be costly and time consuming and the clearances and/or approvals might not be granted timely. We have ongoing responsibilities under the laws and regulations applicable to the manufacturing of products within our facilities and those contracted by third parties that are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and other governmental authorities to determine compliance with the quality system, medical device reporting regulations and other requirements. Costs to comply with regulations, including the EU Medical Device Regulation enacted by the EU in May 2017 and effective in May 2020, and the regulatory laws established by the NMPA in China, and costs associated with remediation can be significant. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to a range of sanctions, including substantial fines, warning letters that require corrective action, product seizures, recalls, the suspension of product manufacturing, revocation of approvals, exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs, substantial fines and criminal prosecution.\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare regulations, including anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws: The relationships that we, and third parties that market and/or sell our products, have with healthcare professionals, such as physicians, hospitals and other healthcare organizations, are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws. In addition, the United States and foreign government regulators have increased the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-bribery laws. We also must comply with a variety of other laws that impose extensive tracking and reporting related to all transfers of value provided to certain healthcare professionals. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we have in the past been, and in the future could be, required to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment of current or former employees and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs. In 2013 and 2018 we settled claims brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) related to the FCPA. Pursuant to these settlements, we paid fines and penalties, and we are working with an independent compliance consultant to implement recommendations that resulted from the independent compliance consultant\u2019s review of our commercial practices.\nWe are subject to data privacy and protection regulations and laws globally, and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws: We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personally identifiable healthcare information. For example, Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in May 2018, applies to all of our activities related\nto products and services that we offer to EU customers and employees. The GDPR established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to 4% of total company revenue). Other governmental authorities around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, which could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process personal data. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we have in the past been, and in the future could be, required to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices.\nWe may be adversely affected by product liability claims, unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements: We are exposed to potential product liability risks inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, many of which are implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. We are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters, including those relating to our Rejuvenate and ABGII Modular-Neck hip stems and LFIT Anatomic CoCr V40 Femoral Heads discussed in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. These matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable. In addition, we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable. We are self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses.\nIntellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products: The medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and, from time to time, we are the subject of claims of infringement or misappropriation. Regardless of outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert management and operating personnel from other business issues. A successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category.\nDependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios: Our long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. If we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection, it could allow others to sell products that directly compete with proprietary features in our product portfolio. Also, our issued patents may be subject to claims challenging their validity and scope and raising other issues. In addition, currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents.\nMARKET RISKS\nWe have exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into United States Dollars: We report our financial results in United States Dollars and approximately 30% of our net sales are denominated in foreign currencies, including the Australian Dollar, British Pound, Euro and Japanese Yen. Cross border transactions with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign currency exchange effects. While we use derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange, our hedging strategies may not be successful, and our unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the United States Dollar results in favorable or unfavorable translation\nDollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\nSTRYKER CORPORATION 2019 FORM 10-K\neffects when the results of our foreign locations are translated into United States Dollars.\nAdditional capital that we may require in the future may not be available to us or may only be available to us on unfavorable terms: Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including operating requirements, current and future acquisitions and the need to refinance existing debt. Our ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by our debt levels, unfavorable changes in economic conditions or uncertainties that affect the capital markets. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to and cost of financing. Higher borrowing costs or the inability to access capital markets could adversely affect our ability to support future growth and operating requirements.\nBUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe are subject to cost containment measures in the United States and other countries resulting in pricing pressures: Initiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business. These initiatives are sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing. Pricing pressure has also increased due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses, reduction in reimbursement levels and medical procedure volumes and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion, reimbursement and pricing generally.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry in which competition in the development and improvement of new and existing products is significant: The markets in which we compete are highly competitive. New products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis and our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by our competitors, who may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, have greater financial, marketing and other resources or be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.\nWe may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals: We seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in healthcare organizations such as hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development. We rely on these professionals to assist us in the development and improvement of proprietary products. If we are unable to maintain these relationships, our ability to develop, market and sell new and improved products could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on indirect distribution channels and major distributors that are independent of Stryker: In many markets, we rely on indirect distribution channels to market, distribute, and sell our products. These indirect channels often are the main point of contact for the healthcare professional and healthcare organization customers who buy and use our products. Our ability to continue to market, distribute, and sell our products may be at risk if the indirect channels choose to sell competitive products, choose to stop selling medical technology, or are subject to new or additional government regulation.\nWe are subject to additional risks associated with our extensive global operations: We develop, manufacture and distribute our products globally. Our global operations are subject to risks and potential costs, including changes in reimbursement,\nchanges in regulatory requirements, differing local product preferences and product requirements, diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries, tariffs and other trade protection measures, international trade disputes and import or export requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations, introduction of new internal business structures and programs, and political and economic instability (such as the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \"Brexit\"). Our business could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of global operations in an increasingly volatile environment.\nWe may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions: In addition to internally developed products, we invest in new products and technologies through acquisitions. Such investments are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us. The risks include the activities required and resources allocated to integrate new businesses, diversion of management time that could adversely affect management's ability to focus on other projects, the inability to realize the expected benefits, savings or synergies from the acquisition, the loss of key personnel, litigation resulting from the acquisition and exposure to unexpected liabilities of acquired companies. In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become or remain profitable.\nWe may be unable to close the Wright Medical acquisition or, if the acquisition does close, to capitalize on it: The completion of the acquisition of Wright Medical Group N.V. (Wright) is subject to a number of conditions. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory clearances, could delay the completion of the transaction for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all. Any delay in completing the transaction could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected benefits of the transaction or to realize them on a different timeline than expected. In addition, the terms and conditions of the required regulatory clearances for the acquisition may impose requirements, limitations or costs that may materially delay the completion of the transaction or could materially adversely affect the expected benefits of the transaction. Any breach by us of the acquisition agreement could also subject us to material liabilities related to the transaction.\nIf completed, the success of the Wright acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate Wright into our businesses and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, from the transaction. If we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe integration of Wright into Stryker may result in material challenges, including: the diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies; maintaining employee morale and retaining key management, sales and other employees; retaining existing business and operational relationships; the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; and unforeseen costs, expenses and liabilities (including litigation related liabilities) associated with the acquisition.\nWe may incur goodwill impairment charges related to one or more of our business units: We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that\nDollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\nSTRYKER CORPORATION 2019 FORM 10-K\nimpairment may exist. In evaluating the potential for impairment we make assumptions regarding revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows, tax rates and discount rates. These assumptions are uncertain and by nature may vary from actual results. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges.\nWe could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate: We operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally. Accordingly, our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations. Income tax authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings. Income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments.\nWe could experience a failure of a key information technology system, process or site or a breach of information security, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers: We rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems to conduct business. In addition, we rely on networks and services, including internet sites, cloud and SaaS solutions, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats pose potential risks to the security of our IT systems, networks and product offerings, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. A security breach, whether of our products, of our customers\u2019 network security and systems or of third-party hosting services, could impact the use of such products and the security of information stored therein. While we have made investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems, hiring of experts, employee training and security policies for employees and third-party providers, the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. If our IT systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action.\nAn inability to successfully manage the implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system could adversely affect our operations and operating results: We are in the process of implementing a new global ERP system. This system will replace many of our existing operating and financial systems. Such an implementation is a major undertaking, both financially and from a management and personnel perspective. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new ERP system could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key employees: Our sales, technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development, marketing and selling of new and existing products. If we are unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive work force in our highly competitive industry, we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives. In addition, if we are unable to maintain an inclusive culture that aligns our diverse work force with our mission and values, this could adversely impact our ability to recruit, hire, develop and retain key talent.\nInterruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business: We and our suppliers have manufacturing sites all over the world; however, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more plants or geographic regions. Orthopaedics has principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in the United States in Florida, Indiana, New Jersey and Virginia and outside the United States in China, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. MedSurg has principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in the United States in Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Puerto Rico, Texas and Washington and outside the United States in France, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. Neurotechnology and Spine has principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in California, Illinois, Indiana, Utah and Virginia and outside the United States in China, France, Ireland, and Switzerland. Damage to our facilities, to our suppliers\u2019 facilities, or to our central distribution centers in Indiana and the Netherlands as a result of natural disasters or otherwise, as well as issues in our manufacturing arising from a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, compliance concerns relating to the quality systems regulation, equipment breakdown or malfunction, environmental hazard incidents or changes to environmental regulations or other factors, could adversely affect the availability of our products. In the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products to meet customer demand. In the event of a significant interruption, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due to the need for regulatory approvals. We may experience loss of market share, additional expense and harm to our reputation.\nWe use a variety of raw materials, components, devices and third-party services in our global supply chains, production and distribution processes; significant shortages, price increases or unavailability of third-party services could increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the competitive position of our products: Our reliance on certain suppliers to secure raw materials, components and finished devices, and on certain third-party service providers, such as sterilization service providers, exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated increases in prices. In addition, several raw materials, components, finished devices and services are procured from a sole-source due to the quality considerations, unique intellectual property considerations or constraints associated with regulatory requirements. If sole-source suppliers or service providers are acquired or were unable or unwilling to deliver these materials or services, we may not be able to manufacture or have available one or more products during such period of unavailability and our business could suffer. In certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials or service providers for such services in a timely or cost effective manner, largely as a result of FDA and other regulations that require, among other things, validation of materials, components and services prior to their use in or with our products.\nDollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.", "PERMNO": 73139, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "SYK"}
