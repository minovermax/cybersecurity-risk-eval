Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks, together with other information provided to you in this Form 10-K. If any of the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. In that case, we might have to decrease, or may not be able to pay, dividends on our Class A shares, the trading price of our Class A shares could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Our Projects\nElectricity generated from wind energy depends heavily on suitable wind conditions and wind turbines being available for operation. If wind conditions are unfavorable or below our expectations, or our wind turbines are not available for operation, our projects\u2019 electricity generation and the revenue generated from our projects may be substantially below our expectations.\nThe revenue generated by our projects is principally dependent on the number of MWh generated in a given time period. The quantity of electricity generation from a wind power project depends heavily on wind conditions, which are variable. Variability in wind conditions can cause our project revenues to vary significantly from period to period. We base our decisions about which projects to acquire as well as our electricity generation estimates, in part, on the findings of long-term wind and other meteorological studies conducted on the project site and its region, which measure the wind\u2019s speed, prevailing direction and seasonal variations. Projections of wind resources also rely upon assumptions about turbine placement, wind turbine power curves, interference between turbines and the effects of vegetation, land use and terrain, which involve uncertainty and require us to exercise considerable judgment. We may make incorrect assumptions in conducting these wind and other meteorological studies. Any of these factors could cause our projects to generate less electricity than we expect and reduce our revenue from electricity sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if an operating project\u2019s historical wind resources are consistent with our long-term estimates, the unpredictable nature of wind conditions often results in daily, monthly and yearly material deviations from the average wind resources we may anticipate during a particular period. If the wind resources at a project are materially below the average levels we expect for a particular period, our revenue from electricity sales from the project could correspondingly be less than expected. A diversified portfolio of projects located in different geographical areas tends to reduce the magnitude of the deviation, but material deviations may still occur. Our cash available for distribution is most directly affected by the volume of electricity generated and sold by our projects. However, for a static portfolio of projects, our consolidated expenses, including operating expenses and interest payments on indebtedness, have less variability than the volume of electricity generated and sold. Accordingly, decreases in the volume of electricity generated and sold by our projects typically result in a proportionately greater decrease in our cash available for distribution. See Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Factors that Significantly Affect our Business-Factors Affecting our Operational Results-Electricity Sales and Energy Derivative Settlements of Our Operating Project.\u201d\nA reduction in electricity generation and sales, whether due to the inaccuracy of wind energy assessments or otherwise, could lead to a number of material adverse consequences for our business, including:\n\u2022\nour projects\u2019 hedging arrangements being ineffective or more costly;\n\u2022\nour projects\u2019 failure to produce sufficient electricity to meet our commitments under our PPAs, hedge arrangements or contracts for sale of RECs, which could result in our having to purchase electricity or RECs on the open market to cover our obligations or result in the payment of damages or the termination of a PPA; and\n\u2022\nour projects not generating sufficient cash flow to make payments of principal and interest as they become due on project-related debt, or distributing sufficient cash flow to pay dividends to holders of our Class A shares.\nWe may be unable to complete our current and any future construction projects on time, and our construction costs could increase to levels that make a project too expensive to complete or make the return on our investment in that project less than expected.\nThere may be delays or unexpected developments in completing our current and any future construction projects, which could cause the construction costs of these projects to exceed our expectations. Most of our construction projects are constructed under fixed-price and fixed-schedule contracts with construction and\nequipment suppliers. However, these contracts provide for limitations on the liability of these contractors to pay us liquidated damages for cost overruns and construction delays. We may suffer significant construction delays or construction cost increases as a result of underperformance of these contractors and equipment suppliers, as well as other suppliers, to our projects. For example, while we maintained a Q4 2014 commercial operation date, during the second half of 2014 we received claims for significant cost increases and schedule relief in the construction of Grand. Samsung C&T Canada Ltd. (a subsidiary of Samsung C&T Corporation), the project construction provider, has in correspondence asserted claims against Grand and the third party owner of an adjacent 100 MW solar project that jointly owns transmission facilities with Grand that were constructed by the project construction provider, totaling approximately C$56.3 million. Grand has, in turn, in correspondence asserted claims against the project construction provider totaling approximately C$53.1 million. Legal action has not yet been commenced by any party against the other in connection with the dispute, and the parties are seeking to resolve the dispute without arbitration. While we continue to be in ongoing discussions with the project construction provider with whom we had a fixed-priced and fixed-schedule contract regarding the validity of their claims and believe it may be possible to negotiate a settlement to the dispute where Grand\u2019s remaining budgeted project contingencies could cover some or all of the settlement amount, no assurances can be given that we can reach a settlement, such settlement amount would be covered entirely by the remaining budgeted project contingencies or otherwise be favorable, arbitration or legal action will not be commenced, or we will not have to bear increased costs associated with this dispute which could make the return on our investment in the project less than expected. To the extent any settlement amount would not be covered entirely by the remaining budgeted project contingencies at Grand, we would be responsible for 45% of the uncovered amount, representing our proportional ownership interest in the project. Grand does not believe it is possible at this point to estimate the amount of any damages to be paid or received in connection with the dispute, and no reserve has been recorded in Grand\u2019s financial statements. One of our partners in Grand is a related party to the project construction provider.\nAdditionally, various other factors could contribute to construction-cost overruns and construction delays, including:\n\u2022\ninclement weather conditions;\n\u2022\nfailure to receive turbines or other critical components and equipment necessary to maintain the operating capacity of our projects, in a timely manner or at all;\n\u2022\nfailure to complete interconnection to transmission networks, which relies on several third parties, including interconnection facilities provided by local utilities;\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain all necessary rights to land access and use;\n\u2022\nfailure to receive quality and timely performance of third-party services;\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain environmental and other permits or approvals;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet domestic content requirements;\n\u2022\nappeals of environmental and other permits or approvals that we hold;\n\u2022\nlawful or unlawful protests by or work stoppages resulting from local community objections to a project;\n\u2022\nshortage of skilled labor on the part of our contractors;\n\u2022\nadverse environmental and geological conditions; and\n\u2022\nforce majeure or other events out of our control.\nAny of these factors could give rise to construction delays and construction costs in excess of our expectations. These circumstances could prevent our construction projects from commencing operations or from meeting our original expectations about how much electricity they will generate or the returns they will achieve. In addition, substantial delays could cause defaults under our financing agreements or under PPAs that require completion of project construction by a certain date at specified performance levels or could result in the loss or\nreduction of expected tax benefits. Our inability to transition our construction projects into financially successful operating projects would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay dividends.\nOur projects rely on a limited number of key power purchasers. The power purchaser for our Santa Isabel project has been downgraded.\nThere are a limited number of possible power purchasers for electricity and RECs produced in a given geographic location. Because our projects depend on sales of electricity and RECs to certain key power purchasers, our projects are highly dependent upon these power purchasers fulfilling their contractual obligations under their respective PPAs. Our projects\u2019 power purchasers may not comply with their contractual payment obligations or may become subject to insolvency or liquidation proceedings during the term of the relevant contracts and, in such event, we may not be able to find another purchaser on similar or favorable terms or at all. In addition, we are exposed to the creditworthiness of our power purchasers and there is no guarantee that any power purchaser will maintain its credit rating, if any. To the extent that any of our projects\u2019 power purchasers are, or are controlled by, governmental entities, our projects may also be subject to legislative or other political action that impairs their contractual performance. Failure by any key power purchasers to meet its contractual commitments or the insolvency or liquidation of one or more of our power purchasers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor example, our 101 MW Santa Isabel project located on the south coast of Puerto Rico sells 100% of its electricity generation including environmental attributes to PREPA under a 20-year PPA. The credit ratings of PREPA and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico were downgraded multiple times in 2014. As of February 26, 2015, the credit rating of PREPA was Caa3, CCC, and CC by each of Moody\u2019s, Standard & Poor\u2019s, and Fitch, respectively, which ratings are all below investment grade. In addition, in June 2014, Puerto Rico enacted legislation purportedly to establish a regime for public corporations in Puerto Rico like PREPA to restructure their debt and other obligations. The validity of such legislation was challenged in U.S. federal court, and in February 2015, the court declared such legislation unconstitutional. The Secretary of Justice of Puerto Rico indicated the government will consider its next steps after reviewing the court\u2019s decision. PREPA has entered into a forbearance agreement until March 2015 with certain of its lenders, and as a part of that agreement has hired a chief restructuring officer to produce a restructuring plan. While as of March 2, 2015, PREPA is current with respect to payments due under the PPA, a failure by PREPA to perform its payment obligations under the PPA, or a restructuring of its obligations under judicially determined valid legislation, may affect its obligations under the PPA which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA prolonged environment of low prices for natural gas, other conventional fuel sources, or competing renewable resources could have a material adverse effect on our long-term business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically low prices for traditional fossil fuels, particularly natural gas, could cause demand for wind power to decrease and adversely affect both the price available to us under power sale agreements that we may enter into in the future and the price of the electricity we generate for sale on a spot-market basis. Approximately 11% of the electricity generated from our projects will be subject to spot-market pricing through at least April 2019. Low spot-market power prices, if combined with other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash available for distribution. Additionally, cheaper conventional fuel sources or competing renewable resources could also have a negative impact on the power prices we are able to negotiate upon the expiration of our current power sale agreements or upon entering into a power sale agreement for a subsequently acquired power project. As a result, the price of our power or RECs subject to the open market could be materially and adversely affected, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash available for distribution. Accordingly, in such event, our future growth prospects could be adversely affected if we remain solely focused on renewable energy projects and are unable to transition to conventional power projects such as gas-fired power projects.\nNatural events and operational problems may cause our power production to fall below our expectations.\nOur electricity generation levels depend upon our ability to maintain the working order of our wind turbines and balance of the plant. A natural disaster, severe weather, accident, failure of major equipment, shortage of or inability to acquire critical replacement or spare parts, failure in the operation of any future transmission facilities that we may acquire, including the failure of interconnection to available electricity transmission or distribution networks, could damage or require us to shut down our turbines or related equipment and facilities, impeding our ability to maintain and operate our facilities and decreasing electricity generation levels and our revenues. For example, our Ocotillo and Santa Isabel (Siemens) and Gulf Wind (MHI) projects have experienced certain blade failures in the last two years. We believe the Siemens blade failures have been fully addressed. Since commercial operation of Gulf Wind, four blades have failed. We have been working with MHI to complete a root cause analysis, testing of the 354 blades at the project, and development of a protocol for determining which blades might have sufficient deficiencies that could pose a threat to long-term reliable operation. As of February 15, 2015, MHI has replaced, or is scheduled to replace, 55 blades under the equipment warranty. While the testing and replacement of blades has adversely affected turbine availability at Gulf Wind, MHI has compensated us for all of the turbine down time under our equipment warranty. MHI has agreed to extend the equipment warranty until November 2015 while we continue discussions on addressing a longer term arrangement to address these potential deficiencies, although we can give no assurance that we will be able to reach any longer term agreement with MHI. If these potential deficiencies do in fact occur and result in blade failures, replacement costs or other effects, and MHI does not address such deficiencies under the equipment warranty or other arrangement, any such effects could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nIn addition, climate change may have the long-term effect of changing wind patterns at our projects. Changing wind patterns could cause changes in expected electricity generation. These events could also degrade equipment or components and the interconnection and transmission facilities\u2019 lives or maintenance costs. Even though our projects enter into warranty agreements with the turbine manufacturer for two- to ten-year terms, such agreements are typically subject to an aggregate maximum cap and there can be no assurance that the supplier will be able to fulfill its contractual obligations.\nIn addition, replacement and spare parts for wind turbines and key pieces of electrical equipment may be difficult or costly to acquire or may be unavailable. Sources for some significant spare parts and other equipment are often located outside of the jurisdictions in which our power projects operate. Additionally, our operating projects generally do not hold spare substation main transformers. These transformers are designed specifically for each wind power project, and order lead times can be lengthy. If one of our projects had to replace any of its substation main transformers, it would be unable to sell all of its power until a replacement is installed. To the extent we experience a prolonged interruption at one of our operating projects due to natural events or operational problems and such events are not fully covered by insurance, our electricity generation levels could materially decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe have a limited operating history and our growth may make it difficult for us to manage our project expansion efficiently.\nWe have a relatively new portfolio of assets, including several projects that have only recently commenced commercial operations or that we expect will commence commercial operations prior to the end of 2015. Stockholders should consider our prospects in light of the risks and uncertainties growing companies encounter in rapidly evolving industries such as ours. Also, our anticipated near-term growth could make it difficult for us to manage our project expansion efficiently due to an inability to employ a sufficient number of skilled personnel or otherwise to effectively manage our capital expenditures and control our costs, including the requisite general and administrative costs necessary to achieve our anticipated growth. These challenges could adversely affect our ability to manage our current or future operating projects in an efficient manner and complete construction of our construction projects in a timely manner, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur operations are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.\nOur projects are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which our projects operate or will operate. These laws and regulations require our projects to obtain and maintain permits and approvals, undergo environmental impact assessments and review processes and implement environmental, health and safety programs and procedures to control risks associated with the siting, construction, operation and decommissioning of power projects. For example, to obtain permits some projects are, in certain cases, required to undertake programs to protect and maintain local endangered or threatened species. If such programs are not successful, our projects could be subject to increased levels of mitigation, penalties or revocation of our permits.\nIf our projects do not comply with applicable laws, regulations or permit requirements, or if there are endangered or threatened species fatalities at our projects, we may be required to pay penalties or fines or curtail or cease operations of the affected projects. Violations of environmental and other laws, regulations and permit requirements, including certain violations of laws protecting wetlands, migratory birds, bald and golden eagles and threatened or endangered species, may also result in criminal sanctions or injunctions.\nCertain environmental laws impose liability on current and previous owners and operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances, even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. In addition to actions brought by governmental agencies, private plaintiffs may also bring claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances on a property or exposure to such substances. Our projects\u2019 liabilities at properties we own or operate arising from past releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permit requirements may change or become more stringent. Any such changes could require our projects to incur additional material costs. Our projects\u2019 costs of complying with current and future environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permit requirements, and any liabilities, fines or other sanctions resulting from violations of them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur projects rely on interconnections to transmission lines and other transmission facilities that are owned and operated by third parties. Our projects are exposed to interconnection and transmission facility development and curtailment risks, which may delay the completion of our construction projects or reduce the return to us on those investments.\nOur projects depend upon interconnection to electric transmission lines owned and operated by regulated utilities to deliver the electricity we generate. A failure or delay in the operation or development of these interconnection or transmission facilities could result in our losing revenues because such a failure or delay could limit the amount of power our operating projects deliver or delay the completion of our construction projects. In addition, certain of our operating projects\u2019 generation of electricity may be curtailed without compensation due to transmission limitations or limitations on the electricity grid\u2019s ability to accommodate intermittent electricity generating sources, reducing our revenues and impairing our ability to capitalize fully on a particular project\u2019s potential. Such a failure or curtailment at levels above our expectations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the future we may acquire projects with their own generator leads to available electricity transmission or distribution networks. In some cases, these facilities may cover significant distances. A failure in our operation of these facilities that causes the facilities to be temporarily out of service, or subject to reduced service, could result in lost revenues because it could limit the amount of electricity our operating projects are able to deliver. In addition, should there be any excess capacity available in those generator lead facilities, and should a third party request access to such capacity, FERC would, or other authorities might, require our projects to provide service over such facilities for that excess capacity to the requesting third party at regulated rates. Should this occur, the\nprojects could be subject to additional regulatory risks and costly compliance burdens associated with being considered the owner and operator of a transmission facility.\nThe loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees may adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our operating projects and complete our construction projects on schedule.\nWe depend on our experienced management team and the loss of one or more key executives could have a negative impact on our business. We also depend on our ability to retain and motivate key employees and attract qualified new employees. Because the wind power industry is relatively new, there is a scarcity of experienced employees in the wind power industry. We may not be able to replace departing members of our management team or key employees. Integrating new executives into our management team and training new employees with no prior experience in the power industry could prove disruptive to our projects, require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention and ultimately prove unsuccessful. An inability to attract and retain sufficient technical and managerial personnel could limit our ability to effectively manage our operating projects and complete our construction projects on schedule and within budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe reintegration event may adversely affect our costs.\nFollowing the occurrence of the reintegration event, we will be faced with increased costs associated with employing a larger number of employees. If Pattern Development reduces the scope of its development activities and is therefore not paying us for the services of the reintegrated employees pursuant to the terms of the Management Services Agreement and our development activities remain insignificant, we may not immediately require the services of all such employees. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur use and enjoyment of real property rights for our projects may be adversely affected by the rights of lienholders and leaseholders that are superior to those of the grantors of those real property rights to our projects.\nOur projects generally are, and any of our future projects are likely to be, located on land occupied pursuant to long-term easements, leases and rights-of-way. The ownership interests in the land subject to these easements, leases and rights-of-way may be subject to mortgages securing loans or other liens (such as tax liens) and other easement, lease rights and rights-of-way of third parties (such as leases of oil or mineral rights) that were created prior to our projects\u2019 easements, leases and rights-of-way. As a result, certain of our projects\u2019 rights under these easements, leases or rights-of-way may be subject, and subordinate, to the rights of those third parties. We perform title searches, obtain title insurance and enter into non-disturbance agreements to protect ourselves against these risks. Such efforts may, however, be inadequate to protect our operating projects against all risk of loss of our rights to use the land on which our projects are located, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain lands, such as lands under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management, or the \u201cBureau of Land Management,\u201d are subject to contractual rights that permit the Bureau of Land Management to adjust rent due on properties to market terms. Any such loss or curtailment of our rights to use the land on which our projects are located and any increase in rent due on such lands could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating projects are, and other future projects may be, subject to various governmental regulations, approvals, and compliance requirements that regulate the sale of electricity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur current projects in operation in the United States are operating as \u201cExempt Wholesale Generators,\u201d or \u201cEWGs,\u201d as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, as amended, or \u201cPUHCA,\u201d and\ntherefore are exempt from certain regulation under PUHCA. Other than Gulf Wind, Panhandle 1 and Panhandle 2, our operating projects in the United States are, however, public utilities under the Federal Power Act subject to rate regulation by FERC. Our future projects in the United States will also likely be subject to such rate regulation once they are placed into service. Our projects in the United States that are subject to FERC rate regulation are required to obtain acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of energy (i.e., not retail sales to consumers), capacity and ancillary services, including their ability to charge \u201cmarket-based rates.\u201d FERC may revoke or revise an entity\u2019s authorization to make wholesale sales at market-based rates if FERC subsequently determines that such entity and its affiliates can exercise horizontal or vertical market power, create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions or market manipulation. In addition, public utilities in the United States are subject to FERC reporting requirements that impose administrative burdens and that, if violated, can expose the company to criminal and civil penalties or other risks.\nMost of our North American projects are located in regions in which the wholesale electric markets are administered by ISOs and Regional Transmission Organizations, or \u201cRTOs.\u201d Several of our current operating projects are subject to the California ISO, or \u201cCAISO,\u201d which is the ISO that prescribes rules for the terms of participation in the California energy market; ERCOT, which is the ISO that prescribes the rules for and terms of participation in the Texas energy market; and the Independent Electricity System Operator, or \u201cIESO,\u201d which is the ISO that administers the wholesale electricity market in Ontario. Many of these entities can impose rules, restrictions and terms of service that are quasi-regulatory in nature and can have a material adverse impact on our business. For example, ISOs and RTOs have developed bid-based locational pricing rules for the energy markets that they administer. In addition, most ISOs and RTOs have also developed bidding, scheduling and market behavior rules, both to curb the potential exercise of market power by electricity generating companies and to ensure certain market functions and system reliability. These actions could materially adversely affect our ability to sell, and the price we receive for, our energy, capacity and ancillary services.\nAll of our current operating projects located in North America are also subject to the reliability standards of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or \u201cNERC.\u201d If we fail to comply with the mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties. Although our U.S. projects are not subject to state utility regulation because our projects sell power exclusively on a wholesale basis, we are subject to certain state regulations that may affect the sale of electricity from our projects, the operations of our projects, as well as the potential for state electricity taxes. Changes in regulatory treatment at the state level are difficult to predict and could have a significant impact on our ability to operate and on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur industry could be subject to increased regulatory oversight.\nOur industry could be subject to increased regulatory oversight. Changing regulatory policies and other actions by governments and third parties with respect to curtailment of electricity generation, electricity grid management restrictions, interconnection rules and transmission may all have the effect of limiting the revenues from, and increasing the operating costs of, our projects which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to regulatory restructuring initiatives at the federal, provincial and state levels, the electricity industry has undergone changes over the past several years. Future government initiatives will further change the electricity industry. Some of these initiatives may delay or reverse the movement towards competitive markets. We cannot predict the future design of wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that on-going regulatory changes will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur projects are not able to insure against all potential risks and may become subject to higher insurance premiums.\nOur projects are exposed to the risks inherent in the construction and operation of wind power projects, such as breakdowns, manufacturing defects, natural disasters, terrorist attacks and sabotage. We are also exposed to\nenvironmental risks. We have insurance policies covering certain risks associated with our business. Our insurance policies do not, however, cover losses as a result of certain force majeure events. In addition, our insurance policies for our projects may cover losses as a result of certain types of natural disasters, terrorist attacks or sabotage, among other things, but such coverage is not always available in the insurance market on commercially reasonable terms and is often capped at predetermined limits. In addition, our insurance policies are subject to annual review by our insurers and may not be renewed on similar or favorable terms or at all. A serious uninsured loss or a loss significantly exceeding the limits of our insurance policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations may have an impact on our financial results and condition.\nWe have exposures to currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily the Canadian dollar, related to buying, selling and financing our business in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate. A portion of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we expect net revenue from non-U.S. dollar markets to continue to represent a portion of our net revenue. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may disrupt the business of our suppliers by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Historically, we have reduced our exposure by aligning our costs with the currency in which we obtain revenues or, if that is impracticable, through financial instruments that provide offsets or limits to our exposures. However, any measures that we may implement in the future to reduce the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations and other risks of our global operations may not be effective or may be expensive. We cannot provide assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations.\nIn addition, foreign currency translation risk arises upon the translation of statement of financial position and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars for purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, which are presented in U.S. dollars. The assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar denominated subsidiaries are translated at the closing rate at the date of reporting and income statement items are translated at the average rate for the period. All resulting exchange differences are recognized in a separate component of equity, \u201cForeign currency translation, net of tax,\u201d and are recorded in \u201cOther comprehensive income, net of tax\u201d. These currency translation differences may have significant negative or positive impacts. Upon the disposal of a non-U.S. dollar denominated subsidiary, the cumulative amount of exchange differences relating to that non-U.S. dollar denominated subsidiary are reclassified from equity to profit or loss. Our foreign currency translation risk mainly relates to our operations in Canada and Chile.\nForeign currency transaction risk arises when we or our subsidiaries enter into transactions where the settlement occurs in a currency other than the functional currency of us or our subsidiary. Exchange differences (gains and losses) arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translation of monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous financial statements are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. In order to reduce significant foreign currency transaction risk from our operating activities, we may use forward exchange contracts to hedge forecasted cash inflows and outflows. Furthermore, most non-U.S. dollar denominated debts are held by non-U.S. dollar denominated subsidiaries in the same functional currency of those subsidiary operations.\nOur cross-border operations require us to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nDoing business in multiple countries requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to liabilities. These laws and regulations may apply to our companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions\nand partnering activities. In particular, our non-U.S. operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or the \u201cFCPA.\u201d The FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their officers, directors, employees and agents acting on their behalf from corruptly offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires companies to make and keep books, records and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets and to maintain a system of adequate internal accounting controls. As part of our business, we deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA. As a result, business dealings between our employees and any such foreign official could expose our company to the risk of violating anti-corruption laws even if such business practices may be customary or are not otherwise prohibited between our company and a private third-party. Violations of these legal requirements are punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts as well as other remedial measures. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations; however, we cannot assure stockholders that these policies and procedures will completely eliminate the risk of a violation of these legal requirements, and any such violation (inadvertent or otherwise) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe own, and in the future may acquire, certain projects in joint ventures, and our partners\u2019 interests may conflict with our and our stockholders\u2019 interests.\nWe own, and in the future may acquire, certain projects in joint ventures, including South Kent and Grand, in each of which we have a 50% and 45% interest, respectively, and El Array\u00e1n, in which we have a 70% interest. In the future, we may invest in other projects with a joint venture partner, including certain Pattern Development-owned projects. Joint ventures inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, which could result in an increase in the financial, legal, operational or compliance risks associated with a project, including, but not limited to, variances in accounting and internal control requirements. To the extent we do not have a controlling interest in a project, our joint venture partners could take actions that decrease the value of our investment and lower our overall return. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise in the future between our company and our stockholders, on the one hand, and our joint venture partners, on the other hand, where our joint venture partners\u2019 business interests are inconsistent with our and our stockholders\u2019 interests. Further, disagreements or disputes between us and our joint venture partners could result in litigation, which could increase our expenses and potentially limit the time and effort our officers and directors are able to devote to our business, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches, including cybersecurity breaches, and other disruptions could compromise our business operations and critical and proprietary information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data and proprietary information regarding our business, employees, shareholders, offtakers, service providers, business partners and other individuals in our data center and on our network. Additionally, we use and are dependent upon information technology systems that utilize sophisticated operational systems and network infrastructure to run our wind farms. Through our 24/7 operations control center, we can, among other things, monitor and control each wind turbine, monitor regional and local climate, track real time market prices and, for some of our projects, monitor certain environmental activities. The secure maintenance of information and information technology systems is critical to our operations. Despite security measures we have employed, including certain measures implemented pursuant to mandatory NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection standards, our infrastructure may be increasingly vulnerable to attacks by hackers or terrorists as a result of the rise in the sophistication and volume of cyberattacks. Also, our information and information technology systems may be breached due to viruses, human error, malfeasance or other malfunctions and disruptions. Any such attack or breach could: (i) compromise our turbines and wind\nfarms thereby adversely affecting generation and transmission to the grid; (ii) adversely affect our operations; (iii) corrupt data; or (iv) result in unauthorized access to the information stored on our networks, including, company proprietary information and employee data causing the information to be publicly disclosed, lost or stolen or result in incidents that could result in harmful effects on the environment and human health, including loss of life. Any such attack, breach, access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in lost revenue, the inability to conduct critical business functions, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, increased regulation, increased protection costs for enhanced cyber security systems or personnel, damage to our reputation and/or the rendering of our disclosure controls and procedures ineffective, all of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisition Strategy and Future Growth\nThe growth of our business depends on locating and acquiring interests in additional attractive independent power and transmission projects at favorable prices.\nOur business strategy includes acquiring power and transmission projects that are either operational, construction-ready, or in limited circumstances, under development. We intend to pursue opportunities to acquire projects from third-party IPPs where we may submit bids from time to time and from Pattern Development pursuant to our Purchase Rights. Various factors could affect the availability of attractive projects to grow our business, including:\n\u2022\ncompeting bids for a project, including a project subject to our Purchase Rights, from other IPPs, including companies that may have substantially greater capital and other resources than we do;\n\u2022\nfewer third-party acquisition opportunities than we expect, which could result from, among other things, available projects having less desirable economic returns or higher risk profiles than we believe suitable for our business plan and investment strategy;\n\u2022\nPattern Development\u2019s failure to complete the development of (i) the Identified ROFO Projects, which could result from, among other things, permitting challenges, failure to procure the requisite financing, equipment or interconnection, or an inability to satisfy the conditions to effectiveness of project agreements such as PPAs and (ii) any of the other projects in its development pipeline, in a timely manner, or at all, in either case, which could limit our acquisition opportunities under our Purchase Rights;\n\u2022\nour failure to exercise our Purchase Rights or acquire assets from Pattern Development;\n\u2022\nour failure to successfully develop and finance projects, to the extent that we decide to pursue development activities with respect to new power projects; and\n\u2022\nlocal opposition to wind turbine installations is growing in certain markets due to concerns about noise, health and other alleged impacts of wind power projects. In addition, indigenous communities in the United States and Canada, including Native Americans and First Nations, are becoming more involved in the development of wind power projects and have certain treaty rights that can negatively affect the viability of power projects. As a result, for these and other reasons, litigation and challenges to wind power projects has increased.\nAny of these factors could prevent us from executing our growth strategy or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, even if we consummate acquisitions that we believe will be accretive to cash available for distribution per share, those acquisitions may in fact result in a decrease in cash available for distribution per Class A share as a result of incorrect assumptions in our evaluation of such acquisitions, unforeseen consequences or other external events beyond our control. Furthermore, if we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and stockholders will not generally have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources.\nAcquisition of power projects involves numerous risks.\nOur strategy includes acquiring power projects. The acquisition of power projects involves numerous risks, many of which may not be able to be discovered through our due diligence process, including exposure to previously existing liabilities and unanticipated costs associated with the pre-acquisition period; difficulty in integrating the acquired projects into our existing business; and, if the projects are in new markets, the risks of entering markets where we have limited experience. While we will perform our due diligence on prospective acquisitions, we may not be able to discover all potential operational deficiencies in such projects or problematic wind characteristics. A failure to achieve the financial returns we expect when we acquire power projects could have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our growth strategy and, ultimately, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur growth strategy is dependent upon the acquisition of attractive power projects developed by third-parties, including Pattern Development, and an inability of such development companies to obtain the requisite financing to develop and construct projects could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business.\nPower project development is a capital intensive, high-risk business that relies heavily on and, therefore, is subject to the availability of debt and equity financing sources to fund projected construction and other projected capital expenditures. As a result, in order to successfully develop a power project, development companies, including Pattern Development, from which we may seek to acquire power projects, must obtain at-risk funds sufficient to complete the development phase of their projects. We, on the other hand, must anticipate obtaining funds from equity or debt financings, including tax equity transactions, or from government grants in order to successfully complete our acquisitions and fund the required construction and other capital costs of the acquired projects. We currently intend to acquire power projects that are construction-ready, which is generally the point in time when the project is able to procure construction financing. Any significant disruption in the credit and capital markets, or a significant increase in interest rates, could make it difficult for development companies to successfully develop attractive projects as well as limit a project\u2019s ability to obtain financing to complete the construction of a project we may seek to acquire. If development companies from which we seek to acquire projects are unable to raise funds when needed or if we or they are unable to secure construction financing, the ability to grow our project portfolio may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our growth strategy and, ultimately, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to grow our cash available for distribution is substantially dependent on our ability to make acquisitions from Pattern Development or third parties on economically favorable terms.\nOur goal of growing our cash available for distribution and increasing dividends to our Class A stockholders is substantially dependent on our ability to make and finance acquisitions on terms that result in an increase in cash available for distribution per Class A share. We target a 10% to 12% annual growth rate in our cash available for distribution per share over three years from 2014. To grow our cash available for distribution per Class A share through acquisitions, we must be able to acquire new generation assets, such as the Identified ROFO Projects, on economically favorable terms. If we are unable to make accretive acquisitions from Pattern Development or third parties because we are unable to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable purchase contracts, obtain financing on economically acceptable terms (as a result of the then current market value of our Class A shares or otherwise) or are outbid by competitors, we may not be able to realize our targeted growth in cash available for distribution per Class A share.\nThe energy industry in Canada, the United States and Chile benefits from governmental support that is subject to change.\nThe energy industry in Canada and the United States, including both fossil fuel and renewable energy sources, in general benefits from various forms of governmental support. Renewable energy sources in Canada benefit from federal and provincial incentives, such as RPS programs, accelerated cost recovery deductions, the\navailability of off-take contracts through RFPs and the Ontario FIT program and other commercially oriented incentives. Renewable energy sources in the United States have benefited from various federal and state governmental incentives, such as PTCs, ITCs, ITC cash grants, loan guarantees, RPS programs and accelerated tax depreciation. ITC cash grants expired with respect to wind energy on January 1, 2013. PTCs and ITCs for wind energy expired on January 1, 2014, unless construction began before January 1, 2015 and further extensions are under consideration for renewal in 2015. Whether the credits will be extended in the future, and the form of any such extension, is uncertain. Renewable energy sources in Chile benefit from the Renewable and Non-Conventional Energy Law, which guarantees a fixed-price for renewable energy until 2024. The existence of these incentives is reflected in, and allows us to reduce, the price we charge for electricity generated by our projects. To the extent that these governmental incentive programs are not renewed or similar incentives are not made available, new wind power projects may need to increase the price of electricity sold to power purchasers, which could result in decreased demand for wind power, and could reduce the number of projects available to us for acquisition which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our growth strategy and, ultimately, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWind power procurement in Canada is a provincial matter, with relatively irregular, infrequent and competitive procurement windows.\nEach province in Canada has its own regulatory framework and renewable energy policy, with few material federal policies to drive the growth of renewable energy. Renewable energy developers must anticipate the future policy direction in each of the provinces, secure viable projects before they can bid to procure a PPA through highly competitive PPA auctions. Most markets are relatively small. Energy policy in our key market of Ontario is subject to a political process, including with respect to its FIT program, and renewable energy procurements may change dramatically as a result of changes in the provincial government or political climate.\nWe face competition primarily from other renewable energy IPPs and, in particular, other wind power companies.\nWe believe our primary competitors are infrastructure funds and some wind power companies or IPPs focused on renewable energy generation. We compete with these companies to acquire well-developed projects with projected stable cash flows that can be built in a cost-effective manner. We also compete with other wind power developers and operators for the limited pool of personnel with requisite industry knowledge and experience. Furthermore, in recent years, there have been times of increased demand for wind turbines and their related components, causing turbine suppliers to have difficulty meeting the demand. If these conditions return in the future, turbine and other component manufacturers may give priority to other market participants, including our competitors, who may have resources greater than ours.\nWe compete with other renewable energy companies (and power companies in general) for the lowest cost financing, which provides the highest returns for our projects. Once we have acquired a construction project and put it into operation, we may compete on price if we sell electricity into power markets at wholesale market prices. Depending on the regulatory framework and market dynamics of a region, we may also compete with other wind power companies and other renewable energy generators, when our projects bid on or negotiate for long-term power sale agreements or sell electricity or RECs into the spot-market. Our ability to compete on price with other wind power companies and other renewable energy IPPs may be negatively impacted if the regulatory framework of a region favors other sources of renewable energy over wind power.\nWe have no control over where our competitors may erect wind power projects. Our competitors may erect wind power projects adjacent to our wind projects that may cause upwind array losses to occur at our wind projects. Upwind array losses reflect the diminished wind resource available at a project resulting from interference with available wind caused by adjacent wind turbines. An adjacent wind power project that causes upwind array losses could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nAny change in power consumption levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe amount of wind power consumed by the electric utility industry is affected primarily by the overall demand for electricity, environmental and other governmental regulations and the price and availability of fuels such as nuclear, coal, natural gas and oil as well as other sources of renewable energy. A decline in prices for these fuels could cause demand for wind power to decrease and adversely affect the demand for renewable energy. For example, low natural gas prices have led, in some instances, to increased natural gas consumption by electricity-generating utilities in lieu of other power sources. To the extent renewable energy and wind power, in particular, becomes less cost-competitive on an overall basis as a result of a lack of governmental incentives, cheaper alternatives or otherwise, demand for wind power and other forms of renewable energy could decrease. Slow growth in overall demand for electricity or a long-term reduction in the demand for renewable energy could have a material adverse effect on our plan to grow our business and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash available for distribution.\nSome states and provinces with RPS programs have met, or will in the near future, meet such targets through projects under contract, which could cause demand for new wind power and other power capacity to decrease.\nSome states with RPS targets have met, or in the near future will meet, their targets through the recent increase in renewable energy development activity. For example, California, which has one of the most aggressive RPS in the United States, is poised to meet its current target of 25% renewable energy generation by 2016 and has the potential to meet its goal of 33% renewable power generation by 2020 with already-proposed new renewable power projects. Ontario anticipates meeting its renewable energy target of 10.7 GW, which excludes hydroelectric sources, by 2018. As a result of achieving these targets, and if these U.S. states and Canadian provinces do not increase their targets in the near future, demand for additional wind power generating capacity could decrease. To the extent other states and provinces do not become market leaders in their stead or increase their RPS targets, demand for power from wind power and other renewable energy projects could decrease in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our growth.\nNew projects being developed that we may acquire may need governmental approvals and permits, including environmental approvals and permits, for construction and operation. Any failure to obtain necessary permits could adversely affect the amount of our growth.\nThe design, construction and operation of wind power projects are highly regulated, require various governmental approvals and permits, including environmental approvals and permits, and may be subject to the imposition of related conditions that vary by jurisdiction. In some cases, these approvals and permits require periodic renewal and a subsequently issued permit may not be consistent with the permit initially issued. We cannot predict whether all permits required for a given project will be granted or whether the conditions associated with the permits will be achievable. The denial or loss of a permit essential to a project or the imposition of impractical conditions upon renewal could impair our ability to construct and operate a project. In addition, we cannot predict whether the permits will attract significant opposition or whether the permitting process will be lengthened due to complexities, legal claims or appeals. Delay in the review and permitting process for a project can impair or delay our ability to construct or acquire a project or increase the cost such that the project is no longer attractive to us.\nIn developing certain of our projects Pattern Development experienced delays in obtaining non-appealable permits and we may experience delays in the future. For example, when we acquired our Ocotillo project, it was then the subject of four active lawsuits brought by a variety of project opponents, all of which have challenged the prior issuance of Ocotillo\u2019s primary environmental analysis and right-of-way entitlement. We had commenced commercial operations at the Ocotillo project in anticipation of securing favorable rulings on these lawsuits. See Item 3 - \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d In Ontario, anti-wind advocacy groups opposed the environmental permit granted to our South Kent and Grand projects. The permits were appealed before the Environmental\nReview Tribunal, which later dismissed the appeals. We are subject to the risk of being unable to complete our projects if any of the key permits are revoked. If this were to occur at any future project, we would likely lose a significant portion of our investment in the project and could incur a loss as a result, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur strategic relationship with Pattern Development through which we expect Pattern Development to help us locate and obtain new projects is limited. Our Purchase Rights may expire and if we do not exercise our Project Purchase Right or if we are not competitive with third party offers, Pattern Development is generally not restricted from competing with us, other than with respect to the Non-Competition Agreement, and, in certain circumstances, Pattern Development may sell its projects to third parties.\nTo the extent we do not exercise our Purchase Rights (or upon their expiration), Pattern Development may sell its projects (including the Pattern Development retained Gulf Wind interest) or Pattern Development itself or substantially all of its assets may be sold to third parties, including our competitors. Even if we are interested in acquiring an asset or investing in an opportunity offered to us by Pattern Development, Pattern Development may offer at an inopportune time for us, or we may not be able to reach an agreement on pricing or other terms. If we are unable to reach an agreement with Pattern Development or its equity owners or if we decline to make an offer, Pattern Development or its equity owners may seek alternative buyers, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our growth strategy and, ultimately, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, our Gulf Wind Call Right terminates upon the second anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, or October 2, 2015, and our Project Purchase Right and our Pattern Development Purchase Right terminate upon the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, or October 2, 2018, but are subject to automatic five-year renewals unless either party dissents at the time of renewal. In addition, our Project Purchase Right and our Pattern Development Purchase Right terminate upon the third occasion on which we decline to exercise our Project Purchase Right with respect to an operational or construction-ready project and following which Pattern Development has sold the project to an unrelated third party. Following termination of our Project Purchase Right and our Pattern Development Purchase Right, Pattern Development will be under no obligation to offer any of its projects to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our growth strategy and ultimately on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOnce our Purchase Rights terminate, the Non-Competition Agreement with Pattern Development will also terminate, and at such time, Pattern Development will no longer be restricted from competing with us for acquisitions.\nThe loss of one or more of our or Pattern Development\u2019s executive officers or key employees may adversely affect our ability to implement our growth strategy.\nIn addition to relying on our management team for managing our projects, our growth strategy relies on our and Pattern Development\u2019s executive officers and key employees for their strategic guidance and expertise in the selection of projects that we may acquire in the future. Because the wind power industry is relatively new, there is a scarcity of experienced executives and employees in the wind power industry. As a result, if one or more of our or Pattern Development\u2019s executive officers or key employees leaves and neither we nor Patten Development are able to find a suitable replacement, our ability to implement our growth strategy may be diminished, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we currently own only wind power projects, in the future, we may decide to expand our acquisition strategy to include other types of power projects or transmission projects. Any future acquisition of non-wind power projects or transmission projects may present unforeseen challenges and result in a competitive disadvantage relative to our more-established competitors.\nIn the future, we may expand our acquisition strategy to include other types of power projects or transmission projects. In September 2014, we announced the addition of our first solar project, Conejo Solar, a\n104MW photovoltaic solar power project being constructed in Chile, to our list of Identified ROFO Projects. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify other attractive non-wind or transmission acquisition opportunities or acquire such projects at a price and on terms that are attractive or that, once acquired, such projects will operate profitably. Additionally, these acquisitions could expose us to increased operating costs, unforeseen liabilities or risks, and regulatory and environmental concerns associated with entering new sectors of the power industry, including requiring a disproportionate amount of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have an adverse impact on our business as well as place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to more established non-wind energy market participants. A failure to successfully integrate such acquisitions into our existing project portfolio as a result of unforeseen operational difficulties or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with litigation or administrative proceedings that could materially impact our operations, including proceedings in the future related to power projects we subsequently acquire.\nWe are subject to risks and costs, including potential negative publicity, associated with lawsuits, in particular, with respect to environmental claims and lawsuits or claims contesting the construction or operation of our projects. See \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings.\u201d The result of and costs associated with defending any such lawsuit, regardless of the merits and eventual outcome, may be material and could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In the future, we may be involved in legal proceedings, disputes, administrative proceedings, claims and other litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business related to a power project that we subsequently acquire. For example, individuals and interest groups may sue to challenge the issuance of a permit for a power project or seek to enjoin construction or operation of a power project. We may also become subject to claims from individuals who live in the proximity of our power projects based on alleged negative health effects related to acoustics caused by wind turbines. In addition, we have been and may subsequently become subject to legal proceedings or claims contesting the construction or operation of our power projects. Any such legal proceedings or disputes could delay our ability to complete construction of a power project in a timely manner, or at all, or materially increase the costs associated with commencing or continuing commercial operations at a power project. Settlement of claims and unfavorable outcomes or developments relating to these proceedings or disputes, such as judgments for monetary damages, injunctions or denial or revocation of permits, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our growth strategy and, ultimately, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Activities\nOur substantial amount of indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to operate our business and impair our ability to pay dividends.\nOur consolidated indebtedness as of December 31, 2014 is approximately $1.50 billion, or approximately 56% of our total capitalization of $2.67 billion at such date.\nOf this amount, approximately $437.0 million represents project-level debt that matures prior to 2021. We do not have available cash or short-term liquid investments sufficient to repay all of this medium-term indebtedness and we have not obtained commitments for refinancing this debt. Therefore, we may not be able to extend the maturity of this indebtedness or to otherwise successfully refinance current maturities if the project finance markets deteriorate substantially or we choose not to raise corporate-level debt in place of project-level debt. Refinancing such indebtedness may force us to accept then-prevailing market terms that are less favorable than the existing indebtedness. If, for any reason, we are unable to refinance the existing indebtedness, those projects may be in default of their existing obligations, which may result in a foreclosure on the project collateral and loss of the project. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences, including, for example:\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with the covenants in the agreements governing these obligations could result in an event of default under those agreements, which could be difficult to cure, or result in our bankruptcy;\n\u2022\nour debt service obligations require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us and our ability to borrow to operate and grow our business;\n\u2022\nour limited financial flexibility could reduce our ability to plan for and react to unexpected opportunities; and\n\u2022\nour substantial debt service obligations make us vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, credit and capital markets, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation and place us at a disadvantage compared with competitors with less debt.\nAny of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we do not comply with our obligations under our debt instruments, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, borrow additional amounts or sell securities, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms or at all. In addition, increases in interest rates and changes in debt covenants may reduce the amounts that we can borrow, reduce our cash flows and increase the equity investment we may be required to make to complete construction of our projects. These increases could cause some of our projects to become economically unattractive. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate sufficient operating cash flow to repay our indebtedness, we could be in default under our lending agreements and could be required to delay construction of our wind power projects, reduce overhead costs, reduce the scope of our projects or abandon or sell some or all of our projects, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our subsidiaries default on their obligations under their project-level debt, we may decide to make payments to lenders to prevent foreclosure on the collateral securing the project-level debt, which would, without such payments, cause us to lose certain of our wind power projects.\nOur subsidiaries incur various types of debt. Non-recourse debt is repayable solely from the applicable project\u2019s revenues and is secured by the project\u2019s physical assets, major contracts, cash accounts and, in many cases, our ownership interest in the project subsidiary. Limited recourse debt is debt where we have provided a limited guarantee, and recourse debt is debt where we have provided a full guarantee, which means if our subsidiaries default on these obligations, we will be liable directly to those lenders, although in the case of limited recourse debt only to the extent of our limited recourse obligations. To satisfy these obligations, we may be required to use amounts distributed by our other subsidiaries as well as other sources of available cash, reducing our cash available to execute our business plan and pay dividends to holders of our Class A shares. In addition, if our subsidiaries default on their obligations under non-recourse financing agreements, we may decide to make payments to prevent the lenders of these subsidiaries from foreclosing on the relevant collateral. Such a foreclosure would result in our losing our ownership interest in the subsidiary or in some or all of its assets. The loss of our ownership interest in one or more of our subsidiaries or some or all of their assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, on our cash available for distribution.\nWe are subject to indemnity obligations.\nWe provide a variety of indemnities in the ordinary course of business to contractual counterparties and to our lenders and other financial partners. For example, the Hatchet Ridge indemnity indemnifies MetLife Capital, Limited Partnership (\u201cMetLife\u201d), the owner participant, under the Hatchet Ridge Wind Lease Financing against certain tax losses.\nIn addition, although we primarily rely on limited recourse or non-recourse financing at our project-level entities we sometimes provide specific indemnities to support such financings. For example, some of our subsidiaries in the United States had obtained construction bridge loans to finance a portion of project construction costs, and in certain cases, such loans were secured by the ITC cash grant proceeds received from the U.S. Treasury. We have assumed certain indemnities that were originally provided by Pattern Development to certain of these bridge lenders and other on-going term lenders in the event that the ITC cash grant is recaptured by the U.S. Treasury, in whole or in part. The cash grant indemnities are in effect for five years from the date the relevant project commences commercial operations. If, for any of those subsidiaries which received the ITC cash grant, the ITC cash grant is recaptured, in whole or in part, we may be required to make payments under the indemnities to prevent the lenders of those subsidiaries from foreclosing on the relevant project collateral. Payment by us under a cash grant indemnity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, on our cash available for distribution.\nOur failure to pay any of these indemnities would enable the applicable project lenders to foreclose on the project collateral. The payments we may be obligated to make pursuant to these indemnities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, on our cash available for distribution. See \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Description of Credit Agreements.\u201d\nOur hedging activities may not adequately manage our exposure to commodity and financial risk, which could result in significant losses or require us to use cash collateral to meet margin requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, which could impair our ability to execute favorable financial hedges in the future.\nCertain of the electricity we generate is sold on the open market at spot-market prices. In order to stabilize all or a portion of the revenue from such sales, we have entered, and may in the future enter, into financial swaps, day-ahead sales transaction or other hedging arrangements. We may acquire additional assets in the future with similar hedging agreements. In an effort to stabilize our revenue from electricity sales from these projects, we evaluate the electricity sale options for each of our projects, including the appropriateness of entering into a PPA, a physical sale, a financial swap, or combination of these arrangements. If we sell our electricity into an ISO market without a PPA, we may enter into a physical sale or financial swap to stabilize all or a portion of our estimated revenue stream. Under the term of our existing physical sales, we are obligated to physically deliver electricity to a common delivery point. Under these arrangements, we sell the electricity produced at our facility to the ISO at the project node and buy energy at the common delivery point to meet the delivery obligations under the physical sale. The delivery obligations under the physical sale are for specified volumes in each hour for an overall quantity that we estimate we are highly likely to produce. Under the terms of our existing financial swaps, we are not obligated to physically deliver or purchase electricity. Instead, we receive payments for specified quantities of electricity based on a fixed-price and are obligated to pay our counterparty the market price for the same quantities of electricity. These financial swaps cover quantities of electricity that we estimate we are highly likely to produce. Gains or losses under the physical sales and financial swaps are designed to be offset by decreases or increases in our revenues from spot sales of electricity in liquid ISO markets. However, the actual amount of electricity we generate from operations may be materially different from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including variable wind conditions and wind turbine availability. If a project does not generate the volume of electricity covered by the associated physical sale or swap contract, we could incur significant losses if electricity prices in the market rise substantially above the fixed-price provided for in the physical sale or financial swap. If a project generates more electricity than is contracted in the physical sale or financial swap, the excess production will not be hedged and the related revenues will be exposed to market-price fluctuations.\nWe would also incur financial losses as a result of adverse changes in the mark-to-market values of the financial swaps or if the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to make payments when due. We could also experience a reduction in cash flow if we are required to post margin in the form of cash collateral to secure our delivery or payment obligations under these hedging agreements. We are not currently required to post cash\ncollateral or issue letters of credit to backstop our obligations under our hedging arrangements after commercial operation has been achieved, but we may be required to do so in the future. However, if we were required to do so, our available cash or available borrowing capacity under the credit facilities under which these letters of credit are issued would be correspondingly reduced.\nWe enter into PPAs when we sell our electricity into markets other than deregulated ISO markets or where we believe it is otherwise advisable. Under a PPA, we contract to sell all or a fixed proportion of the electricity generated by one of our projects, sometimes bundled with RECs and capacity or other environmental attributes, to a power purchaser, often a utility. We do this to stabilize our revenues from that project. We are exposed to the risk that the power purchaser will fail to perform under a PPA, with the result that we will have to sell our electricity at the market price, which could be substantially lower than the price provided in the applicable PPA. In most instances, we also commit to sell minimum levels of generation. If the project generates less than the committed volumes, we may be required to buy the shortfall of electricity on the open market or make payments of liquidated damages or be in default under a PPA, which could result in its termination.\nWe sometimes seek to sell forward a portion of our RECs or other environmental attributes to fix the revenues from those attributes and hedge against future declines in prices of RECs or other environmental attributes. If our projects do not generate the amount of electricity required to earn the RECs or other environmental attributes sold forward or if for any reason the electricity we generate does not produce RECs or other environmental attributes for a particular state, we may be required to make up the shortfall of RECs or other environmental attributes through purchases on the open market or make payments of liquidated damages. Further, current market conditions may limit our ability to hedge sufficient volumes of our anticipated RECs or other environmental attributes, leaving us exposed to the risk of falling prices for RECs or other environmental attributes. Future prices for RECs or other environmental attributes are also subject to the risk that regulatory changes will adversely affect prices.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Class A Shares\nWe are a holding company with no operations of our own, and we depend on our power projects for cash to fund all of our operations and expenses, including to make dividend payments.\nOur operations are conducted almost entirely through our power projects and our ability to generate cash to meet our debt service obligations or to pay dividends is dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from our project subsidiaries through distributions or intercompany loans. Our power projects\u2019 ability to generate adequate cash depends on a number of factors, including wind conditions, timely completion of our construction projects, the price of electricity, payments by key power purchasers, increased competition, foreign currency exchange rates, compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and other factors. See \u201cItem 1A - Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Projects.\u201d Our ability to declare and pay regular quarterly cash dividends is subject to our obtaining sufficient cash distributions from our project subsidiaries after the payment of operating costs, debt service and other expenses. See Item 5 \u201cMarket for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters-Cash Dividend Policy.\u201d We may lack sufficient available cash to pay dividends to holders of our Class A shares due to shortfalls attributable to a number of operational, commercial or other factors, including insufficient cash flow generation by our projects, as well as unknown liabilities, the cost associated with governmental regulation, increases in our operating or general and administrative expenses, principal and interest payments on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 outstanding debt, tax expenses, working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs.\nOur cash available for distribution to holders of our Class A shares may be reduced as a result of restrictions on our subsidiaries\u2019 cash distributions to us under the terms of their indebtedness.\nWe intend to declare and pay regular quarterly cash dividends on all of our outstanding Class A shares. However, in any period, our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A shares depends on the performance\nof our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute cash to us as well as all of the other factors discussed under Item 5 \u201cMarket for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters-Cash Dividend Policy.\u201d The ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us may be restricted by, among other things, the provisions of existing and future indebtedness.\nRestrictions on distributions to us by our subsidiaries under our revolving credit facility and the agreements governing their respective project-level debt could limit our ability to pay anticipated dividends to holders of our Class A shares. These agreements contain financial tests and covenants that our subsidiaries must satisfy prior to making distributions. If any of our subsidiaries is unable to satisfy these restrictions or is otherwise in default under such agreements, it would be prohibited from making distributions to us that could, in turn, limit our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A shares. The terms of our project indebtedness typically require commencement of commercial operations prior to our ability to receive cash distributions from a project. The terms of any such indebtedness also typically include cash management or similar provisions, pursuant to which revenues generated by projects subject to such indebtedness are immediately, or upon the occurrence of certain events, swept into an account for the benefit of the lenders under such debt agreements. As a result, project revenues typically only become available to us after the funding of reserve accounts for, among other things, debt service, taxes and insurance at the project level. In some instances, projects may be required to sweep cash to reserve funds intended to mitigate the results of pending litigation or other potentially adverse events. If our projects do not generate sufficient cash available for distribution, we may be required to fund dividends from working capital, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from future offerings, the sale of assets or by obtaining other debt or equity financing, which may not be available, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our Class A shares and on our ability to pay dividends at anticipated levels or at all. See \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Description of Credit Agreements.\u201d\nOur ability to pay regular dividends on our Class A shares is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors.\nOur Class A stockholders have no contractual or other legal right to dividends. The payment of future dividends on our Class A shares will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Our Board of Directors will have the authority to establish cash reserves for the prudent conduct of our business, and the establishment of or increase in those reserves could result in a reduction in cash available for distribution to pay dividends on our Class A shares at anticipated levels. Accordingly, we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our Class A shares, which could adversely affect the market price of our Class A shares.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired and investors\u2019 views of us could be harmed.\nU.S. securities laws require, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Because we ceased being an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act on December 31, 2014, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we are not able to comply with these requirements in a timely manner, or if we identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our shares could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchanges on which we list, the SEC, the Canadian Securities Administrators or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. During 2014, we filed with the SEC amendments to our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for each of the quarters ended March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014 to correct errors therein. Management reported\nmaterial weaknesses in our system of internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2014, June 30, 2014 and September 30, 2014. We had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting with respect to design and operation of controls over the methodology used to calculate earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2014. In addition, management determined that a material weakness existed in internal control over financial reporting related to the review and application of technical accounting principles. While management has taken actions to remediate the material weaknesses and believes such material weaknesses have been remedied, we may be incorrect in such assessment. Moreover, a number of our transactions, including business combinations and other acquisitions, require complex accounting and significant accounting estimates which can result in errors in the reported amounts of acquired assets or liabilities. Accordingly, additional material weaknesses may occur in the future, and we may be unable to provide holders of our securities with the required financial information in a timely and reliable manner which could subject us to litigation and regulatory enforcement actions.\nEven if we conclude, from time to time, that our internal control over financial reporting provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements. This, in turn, could have an adverse impact on trading prices for our Class A shares, and could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets.\nRisks Regarding Our Cash Dividend Policy\nWe do not have a sufficient operating history as an independent company upon which to rely in evaluating whether we will have sufficient cash available for distribution and other sources of liquidity to allow us to pay dividends on our Class A shares at our current quarterly dividend levels on an annualized basis. While we believe that we will have sufficient available cash to enable us to pay the aggregate dividend on our Class A shares for the year ending December 31, 2015, we may be unable to pay the quarterly dividend or any amount on our Class A shares during these periods or any subsequent period. Holders of our Class A shares have no contractual or other legal right to receive cash dividends from us on a quarterly or other basis and, while we currently intend to at least maintain our current dividend and to grow our business and continue to increase our dividend per Class A share over time, our cash dividend policy is subject to all the risks inherent in our business and may be changed at any time. Some of the reasons for such uncertainties in our stated cash dividend policy include the following factors:\n\u2022\nOur revolving credit facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants that will subject certain of our project subsidiaries to restrictions on making distributions to us. See Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Description of Credit Agreements-Revolving Credit Facility.\u201d Our subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions on distributions under the agreements governing their respective project-level debt. Additionally, we may incur debt in the future to acquire new power projects, the terms of which will likely require commencement of commercial operations prior to our ability to receive cash distributions from such acquired projects. These agreements likely will contain financial tests and covenants that our subsidiaries must satisfy prior to making distributions. The current financial tests and covenants applicable to our subsidiaries are described in Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Description of Credit Agreements.\u201d If any of our subsidiaries is unable to satisfy these restrictions or is otherwise in default under our financing agreements, it would be prohibited from making distributions to us, which could, in turn, limit our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A shares at our intended level or at all.\n\u2022\nOur Board of Directors will have the authority to establish cash reserves for the prudent conduct of our business, and the establishment of or increase in those reserves would reduce the cash available to pay our dividends.\n\u2022\nWe may lack sufficient cash available for distribution to pay our dividends due to operational, commercial or other factors, some of which are outside of our control, including insufficient cash flow\ngeneration by our projects, as well as unexpected operating interruptions, insufficient wind resources, legal liabilities, the cost associated with governmental regulation, changes in governmental subsidies or regulations, increases in our operating or selling, general and administrative expenses, principal and interest payments on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 outstanding debt, tax expenses, working capital requirements and anticipated cash reserve needs.\nWe are an SEC foreign issuer under Canadian securities laws and, therefore, are exempt from certain requirements of Canadian securities laws applicable to other Canadian reporting issuers.\nAlthough we are a reporting issuer in Canada, we are an SEC foreign issuer under Canadian Securities laws and are exempt from certain Canadian securities laws relating to continuous disclosure obligations and proxy solicitation if we comply with certain reporting requirements applicable in the United States, provided that the relevant documents filed with the SEC are filed in Canada and sent to our Class A stockholders in Canada to the extent and in the manner and within the time required by applicable U.S. requirements. In some cases the disclosure obligations applicable in the United States are different or less onerous than the comparable disclosure requirements applicable in Canada for a Canadian reporting issuer that is not exempt from Canadian disclosure obligations. Therefore, there may be less or different publicly available information about us than would be available if we were a Canadian reporting issuer that is not exempt from such Canadian disclosure obligations.\nPattern Development\u2019s general partner and its officers and directors have fiduciary or other obligations to act in the best interests of Pattern Development\u2019s owners, which could result in a conflict of interest with us and our stockholders.\nPattern Development holds approximately 25% of our outstanding Class A shares, representing in the aggregate an approximate 25% voting interest in our company. Upon the occurrence of the Conversion Event on December 31, 2014, Pattern Development and the management holders who had previously held our Class B shares became entitled to receive dividends, beginning on January 1, 2015, on these shares which have been converted to Class A shares. We are party to the Management Services Agreement, pursuant to which each of our executive officers (including our Chief Executive Officer), with the exception of our Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, Operations, is a shared PEG executive and devotes time to both our company and Pattern Development as needed to conduct our respective businesses. As a result, these shared PEG executives have fiduciary and other duties to Pattern Development. Conflicts of interest may arise in the future between our company (including our stockholders other than Pattern Development) and Pattern Development (and its owners and affiliates). Our directors and executive officers owe fiduciary duties to the holders of our shares. However, Pattern Development\u2019s general partner and certain of its officers and directors also have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of Pattern Development\u2019s limited partners, which interest may differ from or conflict with that of our company and our other stockholders.\nPattern Development\u2019s share ownership may limit other stockholders ability to influence corporate matters.\nPattern Development or its affiliates hold approximately 25% of the combined voting power of our shares, and this concentration of voting power may limit other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters, and as a result, actions may be taken that other stockholders may not view as beneficial. As a result of its ownership in our company, Pattern Development has significant influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors. In addition, even though a recent sale of shares by Pattern Development resulted in a decrease of its ownership interest in our company from 35% to 25% such that it is no longer entitled to certain contractual approval rights pursuant to the Shareholder Approval Rights Agreement (see \u201cItem 5. Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters\u201d), Pattern Development or its affiliates through its remaining shareholdings still may have the ability to exercise substantial influence over our company, including with respect to decisions relating to our capital structure, issuing additional Class A shares or other equity securities, paying dividends on our Class A shares, incurring additional debt, making acquisitions,\nselling properties or other assets, merging with other companies and undertaking other extraordinary transactions. In any of these matters, the interests of Pattern Development and its affiliates may differ from or conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nCertain of our executive officers will continue to have an economic interest in, as well as provide services to Pattern Development, which could result in conflicts of interest.\nCertain of our executive officers provide services to Pattern Development pursuant to the terms of the Management Services Agreement between our company and Pattern Development and, as a result, in some instances, have fiduciary or other obligations to Pattern Development. Additionally, our Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President, Business Development, Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Senior Vice President, Fiscal and Administrative Services and Senior Vice President, Engineering and Construction have economic interests in Pattern Development and, accordingly, the benefit to Pattern Development from a transaction between Pattern Development and our company will proportionately inure to their benefit as holders of economic interests in Pattern Development. Pattern Development is a related party under the applicable securities laws governing related party transactions and, as a result, any material transaction between our company and Pattern Development (except the occurrence of the reintegration event) is subject to our corporate governance guidelines, which require prior approval of any such transaction by the conflicts committee, which is comprised solely of independent members of our Board of Directors. Those of our executive officers who have economic interests in Pattern Development may be conflicted when advising the conflicts committee or otherwise participating in the negotiation or approval of such transactions. These executive officers have significant project- and industry-specific expertise that could prove beneficial to the conflicts committee\u2019s decision-making process and the absence of such strategic guidance could have a material adverse effect on our company\u2019s ability to evaluate any such transaction and, in turn, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRiverstone is under no obligation to offer us an opportunity to participate in any business opportunities that it may consider from time to time, including those in the energy industry, and, as a result, Riverstone\u2019s existing and future portfolio companies may compete with us for investment or business opportunities.\nConflicts of interest could arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and Riverstone, including its portfolio companies, on the other hand, concerning among other things, potential competitive business activities or business opportunities. Riverstone is a private equity firm in the business of making investments in entities primarily in the energy industry. As a result, Riverstone\u2019s existing and future portfolio companies (other than Pattern Development, which is subject to the Non-Competition Agreement) may compete with us for investment or business opportunities. These conflicts of interest may not be resolved in our favor.\nSubject to the terms of the Non-Competition Agreement with, and our Purchase Rights granted to us by, Pattern Development, we have expressly renounced any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any business opportunity that may be from time to time presented to Riverstone or any of its officers, directors, agents, stockholders, members or partners or business opportunities that such parties participate in or desire to participate in, even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so, and no such person shall be liable to us for breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a director or officer or controlling stockholder or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person pursues or acquires any such business opportunity, directs any such business opportunity to another person or fails to present any such business opportunity, or information regarding any such business opportunity, to us unless, in the case of any such person who is our director or officer, any such business opportunity is expressly offered to such director or officer solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer. Riverstone has advised us that it does not have a formal policy regarding business opportunities presented to the investment funds managed or advised by it and their respective portfolio companies, but Riverstone\u2019s practice has been that any business opportunities may be pursued by any such fund or directed to any such portfolio company except when the business opportunity has been presented to an employee of Riverstone or its affiliates solely in his or her capacity as a director of a portfolio company.\nAs a result, Riverstone may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and may direct such opportunities to other businesses in which it has invested, in which case we may not become aware of or otherwise have the ability to pursue such opportunities. Further, such businesses may choose to compete with us for these opportunities. As a result, our renouncing our interest and expectancy in any business opportunity that may be from time to time presented to Riverstone could adversely impact our business or prospects if attractive business opportunities are procured by such parties for their own benefit rather than for ours.\nOur actual or perceived failure to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest with Pattern Development could damage our reputation, increase our exposure to potential litigation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur conflicts committee is required to review, and make recommendations to the full Board of Directors regarding, any future transactions involving the acquisition of an asset or investment in an opportunity offered to us by Pattern Development to determine whether the offer is fair and reasonable (including any acquisitions by us of assets of Pattern Development pursuant to our Purchase Rights). However, our establishment of a conflicts committee may not prevent holders of our shares from filing derivative claims against us related to these conflicts of interest and related party transactions. Regardless of the merits of their claims, we may be required to expend significant management time and financial resources on the defense of such claims. Additionally, to the extent we fail to appropriately deal with any such conflicts, it could negatively impact our reputation and ability to raise additional funds and the willingness of counterparties to do business with us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMarket interest and foreign exchange rates may have an effect on the value of our Class A shares.\nOne of the factors that influences the price of our Class A shares will be the effective dividend yield of our Class A shares (i.e., the yield as a percentage of the then market price of our Class A shares) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates, which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates, may lead prospective purchasers of our Class A shares to expect a higher dividend yield and, our inability to increase our dividend as a result of an increase in borrowing costs, insufficient cash available for distribution or otherwise, could result in selling pressure on, and a decrease in the market price of, our Class A shares as investors seek alternative investments with higher yield. Additionally, we intend to pay a regular quarterly dividend in U.S. dollars and, as a result, to the extent the value of the U.S. dollar dividend decreases relative to Canadian dollars, the market price of our Class A shares in Canada could decrease.\nThe price of our Class A shares may fluctuate significantly, and stockholders could lose all or part of their investment.\nVolatility in the market price of our shares may prevent stockholders from being able to sell their Class A shares at or above the price stockholders paid for their shares. The market price of our Class A shares could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual results of operations or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\na change in interest rates or changes in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the Canadian securities regulators and the SEC;\n\u2022\nchanges in, or failure to meet, earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track our Class A shares or the stock of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nthe failure of research analysts to cover our Class A shares;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us, our power purchasers or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nmaterial litigation or government investigations;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable tax laws;\n\u2022\nchanges in general conditions in the United States, Canadian and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events;\n\u2022\nchanges in key personnel;\n\u2022\nsales of Class A shares by us or members of our management team;\n\u2022\ntermination of lock-up agreements with our management team and principal stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe granting or exercise of employee stock options;\n\u2022\nvolume of trading in our Class A shares; and\n\u2022\nthe realization of any risks described under \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nIn addition, volatility in the stock markets has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the price of our Class A shares could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company, and these fluctuations could materially reduce the share price of our Class A shares and cause stockholders to lose all or part of their investment. Further, in the past, market fluctuations and price declines in a company\u2019s stock have led to securities class action litigation. If such a suit were to arise, it could have a substantial cost and divert our resources regardless of the outcome.\nWe incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could harm our operating results, and such costs may increase when we cease to be an emerging growth company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with current corporate governance requirements, Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, as well as rules implemented by the SEC, the Canadian Securities Administrators and the stock exchanges on which our Class A shares are traded.\nThe expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have increased dramatically over the past several years. Greater expenditures may be necessary in the future with the advent of new laws and regulations pertaining to public companies. If we are not able to comply with these requirements in a timely manner, the market price of our Class A shares could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, the Canadian Securities Administrators, the applicable stock exchanges or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nAs a result of the FPA and FERC\u2019s regulations in respect of transfers of control, absent prior authorization by FERC, neither we nor Pattern Development can convey, nor will an investor in our company generally be permitted to obtain, a direct and/or indirect voting interest in 10% or more of our issued and outstanding voting securities, and a violation of this limitation could result in civil or criminal penalties under the FPA and possible further sanctions imposed by FERC under the FPA.\nWe are a holding company with U.S. operating subsidiaries that are \u201cpublic utilities\u201d (as defined in the FPA) and, therefore, subject to FERC\u2019s jurisdiction under the FPA. As a result, the FPA requires us or Pattern\nDevelopment, as the case may be, either to (i) obtain prior authorization from FERC to transfer an amount of our voting securities sufficient to convey direct or indirect control over any of our public utility subsidiaries or (ii) qualify for a blanket authorization granted under or an exemption from FERC\u2019s regulations in respect of transfers of control. Similar restrictions apply to purchasers of our voting securities who are a \u201cholding company\u201d under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, or \u201cPUHCA,\u201d in a holding company system that includes a transmitting utility or an electric utility, or an \u201celectric holding company,\u201d regardless of whether our voting securities were purchased in our initial public offering, subsequent offerings by us or Pattern Development, in open market transactions or otherwise. A purchaser of our voting securities would be a \u201cholding company\u201d under the PUHCA and an electric holding company if the purchaser acquired direct or indirect control over 10% or more of our voting securities or if FERC otherwise determined that the purchaser could directly or indirectly exercise control over our management or policies (e.g., as a result of contractual board or approval rights). Under the PUHCA, a \u201cpublic-utility company\u201d is defined to include an \u201celectric utility company,\u201d which is any company that owns or operates facilities used for the generation, transmission or distribution of electric energy for sale, and which includes EWGs such as our U.S. operating subsidiaries. Accordingly, absent prior authorization by FERC or a general increase to the applicable percentage ownership under a blanket authorization, for the purposes of sell-side transactions by us or Pattern Development and buy-side transactions involving purchasers of our securities that are electric holding companies, no purchaser can acquire 10% or more of our issued and outstanding voting securities. A violation of these regulations by us or Pattern Development, as sellers, or an investor, as a purchaser of our securities, could subject the party in violation to civil or criminal penalties under the FPA, including civil penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation and other possible sanctions imposed by FERC under the FPA.\nAs a result of the FPA and FERC\u2019s regulations in respect of transfers of control, and consistent with the requirements for blanket authorizations granted thereunder or exemptions therefrom, absent prior authorization by FERC, no purchaser of our common shares in open market, or in subsequent offerings of our voting securities, will be permitted to purchase an amount of our securities that would cause such purchaser and its affiliate and associate companies to collectively hold 10% or more of our voting securities outstanding. Additionally, investors should manage their investment in us in a manner consistent with FERC\u2019s regulations in respect of obtaining direct or indirect \u201ccontrol\u201d of our company. Accordingly, absent prior authorization by FERC, investors in our common shares that are electric holding companies are advised not to acquire a direct and/or indirect voting interest in 10% or more of our issued and outstanding voting securities, whether in connection with an offering by us or Pattern Development, open market purchases or otherwise.\nProvisions of our organizational documents and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, as a result, depress the trading price of our Class A shares.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our Board of Directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprohibit our stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take corporate actions other than those desired.\nFuture sales of our shares in the public market could lower our Class A share price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities may dilute stockholders\u2019 ownership in us and may adversely affect the market price of our Class A shares.\nIn May 2014, we completed a follow-on offering of our Class A shares. In total, 21,117,171 Class A shares were sold. Of this amount, we sold 10,810,810 Class A shares and Pattern Development, a selling stockholder, sold 10,306,361 of our Class A shares. In addition, in February 2015, we completed another follow-on offering of our Class A shares. In total 12,000,000 Class A shares were sold. Of this amount, we issued and sold 7,000,000 Class A shares and Pattern Development, a selling shareholder, sold 5,000,000 of our Class A shares. If we sell, or if Pattern Development sells, additional large numbers of our Class A shares, or if we issue a large number of shares of our Class A common stock in connection with future acquisitions, financings, or other circumstances, the market price of our Class A shares could decline significantly. Moreover, the perception in the public market that we or Pattern Development might sell Class A shares could depress the market price of those shares.\nIn addition, on May 6, 2014, Pattern Development entered into a loan agreement pursuant to which it may pledge up to 18,700,000 Class A shares to secure a $100.0 million loan. If Pattern Development were to default on its obligations under the loan, the lenders, upon the expiration of certain lock-up agreements, would have the right to sell shares to satisfy Pattern Development\u2019s obligation. Such an event could cause our stock price to decline. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A shares or the effect, if any, that future issuances or sales of our shares will have on the market price of our shares. Sales of substantial amounts of our shares (including sales pursuant to Pattern Development\u2019s registration rights and shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A shares.", "PERMNO": 14168, "SIC": 4991, "TIC": "PEGI"}
