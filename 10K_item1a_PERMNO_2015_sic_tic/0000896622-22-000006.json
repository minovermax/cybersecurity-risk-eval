{"cik": "896622", "company": "APTARGROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or other events to materially differ from the results or events contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. You should carefully consider the following factors in addition to other information contained in this report before purchasing any shares of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Operations and Industry\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business, and future developments could continue to cause adverse effects, which may be material. During 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected our sales of products to our prescription pharma customers due to lower incidences of common illnesses and doctors appointments and to our travel and retail beauty business and on-the-go beverage customers and, while during 2021 we have experienced a return toward pre-pandemic levels in several of our markets, there remain uncertainties related to the pandemic that could adversely affect our business. Customer demand across all segments may decrease quickly as a result of future developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the extent, duration and severity of further resurgences, the availability, adoption and efficacy of approved vaccines and treatments, the length of time it takes for normal economic and operating conditions to resume, additional governmental actions that may be taken and/or extended in response to further resurgences of the virus, and numerous other uncertainties. Such events may result in business and manufacturing disruption, inventory shortages due to disruptions to our supply chain and distribution channels, delivery delays, increased risk associated with customer payments, increased labor cost and reduced labor availability, and reduced sales and operations, any of which could materially affect our stock price, business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe majority of our office and management personnel are working remotely and the majority of our facilities remained operational during 2021 as each of our segments produce dispensing systems that have been determined to be essential products by various government agencies around the world. The health and safety of our workforce is of primary concern and we may need to enact further precautionary measures to help minimize the risk of our employees being exposed to the virus and overall organization fatigue. Further, our management team is focused on mitigating the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has required and will continue to require a large investment of time and resources across the entire company, thereby diverting their attention from other priorities that existed prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. Incremental operating costs related to heightened cleaning and sanitizing procedures at our factories, personal protective equipment for our employees and temporary labor costs necessary to attract and retain employees and address absenteeism, among others, will be necessary as the pandemic continues in the near-term. If these conditions worsen, or continue to last for an extended period of time, our ability to manage our business may be impaired, and operational risks, cybersecurity risks and other risks facing us even prior to the pandemic may be elevated.\nIf there is deterioration in economic conditions in a particular region or market, our business and operating results could be materially adversely impacted. Due to our strong balance sheet, diverse product offerings, various end-markets served, and our broad geographic presence, we believe we are well positioned to withstand temporary slowness in any one particular region or market. However, economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. A tightening of credit in financial markets or other factors may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, customers or distributors could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults, inventory or supply challenges and pricing pressures. An interruption in supply may also impact our ability to meet customer demands. Consumer demand for our customers\u2019 products and shifting consumer preferences are unpredictable and could have a negative impact on our customers and our customers\u2019 demand for our products.\nEmployee retention or labor cost inflation could disrupt our business. Labor cost and availability are subject factors that are beyond our control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce participation rates. As a result, there is no assurance that we will be able to recruit, train, assimilate, motivate and retain employees in the future. The loss of a substantial number of our employees or a prolonged labor dispute could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe face strong global competition and our market share could decline. All of the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we continue to experience competition in all product lines and segments. Competitors, including privately and publicly held entities that range from regional to international companies, are becoming increasingly credible in the core markets in which we do business. We expect the market for our products to remain competitive, as consolidation among our competitors is increasing in the current economic climate.\nCustomers and consumers are increasingly requesting solutions that can be refilled and reused as the market moves toward more sustainable products. A competitor's design innovation or ability to provide more sustainable products could have an adverse impact on our business. If we are unable to compete successfully, our market share may decline, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n10/ATR\n2021 Form 10-K\nGeopolitical conditions, including trade disputes and direct or indirect acts of war or terrorism, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our operations could be disrupted by geopolitical conditions, trade disputes, international boycotts and sanctions, political and social instability, acts of war, terrorist activity or other similar events. Such events could make it difficult, impossible or more expensive to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, all of which could adversely affect our business globally or in certain regions. In addition, our customers may export their finished products using our dispensing devices that were sold in other regions and an adverse geopolitical event may impact the sales of our customers\u2019 products and thus indirectly negatively impact the demand for our dispensing solutions. Although our business is diversified across ten end markets and many geographies and we believe our diverse business model, coupled with our diverse and global customer base, allow some protection from dependency on any one geographic region, country or even trade route, our diversification efforts may not be successful in insulating our operations from disruptive geopolitical conditions and we do face some risk related to trade policies specific to any country we operate in or to which our customers export their products.\nAt the end of 2021 and into January 2022, tensions between the U.S. and Russia escalated when Russia assembled large numbers of military ground forces on the Ukraine-Russia border, increasing speculation that Russia may attempt to invade Ukraine in the near future. A potential invasion of Ukraine and any retaliatory measures taken by the U.S. and NATO have created global security concerns that could have a lasting impact on regional and global economies. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 2% of our consolidated net sales were from Russia and Ukraine, however less than 1% is imported into Russia and Ukraine and therefore we do not expect a material impact to our consolidated results if the situation escalates.\nConsolidation of our customer base could impact our business. We believe mergers and acquisitions within our customer base create opportunities for increasing sales due to the breadth of our product line, our international presence and our long-term relationships with certain customers. However, consolidation of our customers could lead to pricing pressures, concentration of credit risk and fewer opportunities to introduce new products to the market.\nThe success or failure of our customers\u2019 products, particularly in the pharmaceutical market, may materially affect our operating results and financial condition. In the pharmaceutical market, the proprietary nature of our customers\u2019 products and the success or failure of their products in the market using our dispensing systems may have a material impact on our operating results and financial condition. We may potentially work for years on modifying our dispensing device to work in conjunction with a customer\u2019s drug formulation. If the customer\u2019s pharmaceutical product is not approved by regulatory bodies or it is not successful on the market, the associated costs may not be recovered.\nHigher raw material costs and other inputs and an inability to offset these higher costs with price increases may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The cost of raw materials and other inputs (particularly plastic resin, rubber, metal, anodization costs and transportation and energy costs) are volatile and susceptible to rapid and substantial changes due to factors beyond our control, such as changing economic conditions, currency fluctuations, weather conditions, political unrest and instability in energy-producing nations, and supply and demand pressures. Raw material costs may continue to increase in the coming years due to market fluctuation and the use of post-consumer resin for our sustainable product offerings and, although we have generally been able to increase selling prices to cover increased costs, future market conditions may prevent us from passing these increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases. In addition, we may not be able to improve productivity or realize savings from our cost reduction programs sufficiently enough to offset the impact of increased raw material costs. As a result, higher raw material costs could result in declining margins and operating results.\nIn difficult market conditions, our fixed costs structure combined with potentially lower revenues may negatively impact our results. Our business is characterized by relatively high fixed costs and, notwithstanding our utilization of third-party manufacturing capacity, most of our production requirements are met by our own manufacturing facilities. In difficult environments, we are generally faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in product demand. During such periods, our plants may not operate at full capacity and the costs associated with this excess capacity are charged directly to cost of sales. Difficult market conditions in the future may adversely affect our utilization rates and consequently our future gross margins, and this, in turn, could have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, our business, operating results and financial position could be materially adversely affected. The majority of our European and Latin American employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements made either at the local or national level in their respective countries. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that this will continue. If disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage, we could experience a significant disruption of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial position.\nSingle sourced materials and manufacturing sites could adversely impact our ability to deliver product. We source certain materials, especially some resins and rubber components for our pharmaceutical segment, from a single source. Any disruption in the supply of these materials could adversely impact our ability to deliver product to our customers. Similarly, we have certain components and products that are manufactured at a single location or from a single machine or mold. Any disruption to the manufacturing process could also adversely impact our ability to deliver product to our customers.\n11/ATR\n2021 Form 10-K\nWe are exposed to risks from lawsuits and claims, including intellectual property infringement claims and product liability claims, as well as investigations, audits and other proceedings, which may result in substantial costs and expenses or interruption of our normal business operations. We are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business, which include infringement, product liability, commercial, employment, tort, and other litigation. The failure of our devices to operate as intended may result in a product liability claim against us. We believe we maintain adequate levels of product liability insurance coverage. However, a product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage or not covered by existing insurance may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. We are also from time to time subject to claims from third parties suggesting that we may be infringing on their intellectual property rights. If we were held liable for infringement, we could be required to pay damages, obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products.\nIn addition, we are subject to investigations, audits and other proceedings initiated by federal, state, international, national, provincial and local authorities, including regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration as a result of our Pharma segment. We are also subject to indemnification claims under various contracts. Current and future litigation, proceedings or indemnification claims that we face may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management regardless of the outcome. In addition, these matters could lead to increased operating costs or interruptions of our normal business operations. Litigation, proceedings and indemnification claims involve uncertainties and the eventual outcome of any such matter could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nIncreased global cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated, targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our operations. Increased global information security threats and more sophisticated, targeted computer crime pose a risk to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data, operations and infrastructure, as well as the data of our customers. We continue to assess potential threats and make investments seeking to reduce the risk of these threats by employing a number of security measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, ensuring strong data protection standards including authentication mechanisms are in place and safeguarding our critical information assets.\nWe also periodically test our systems for vulnerabilities and regularly rely on third parties to conduct such tests. To date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these threats; however, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent unauthorized access or loss of functionality to our or our third-party providers' systems. Even with these mitigations, our information systems remain potentially vulnerable to sophisticated cybersecurity threats, particularly as more business activities have shifted online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.\nIf our integration of acquisitions are unsuccessful, our financial performance may suffer. We continue to pursue growth through acquisitions, including the recent Voluntis, Hengyu, Fusion and Noble acquisitions. If our integration efforts, including unlocking synergies, are unsuccessful we may not realize the full potential of the acquisitions and as a result our financial performance may suffer.\nRisks Related to Financial, Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results. A majority of our operations are located outside of the United States. Because of this, movements in exchange rates may have an impact on the translation of the financial statements of our foreign entities. Our primary foreign exchange exposure is to the euro, but we have foreign exchange exposure to the Chinese yuan, Brazilian real, Mexican peso, Swiss franc, and other Asian, European and South American currencies. A strengthening U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies has a dilutive translation effect on our financial statements. Conversely, a weakening U.S. dollar has an additive translation effect. In some cases, we sell products denominated in a currency different from the currency in which the related costs are incurred. We manage our exposures to foreign exchange principally with forward exchange contracts to economically hedge certain transactions and firm purchase and sales commitments denominated in foreign currencies. The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially affect our operating results.\nWe have approximately $974.2 million in recorded goodwill at December 31, 2021, and changes in future business conditions could cause this asset to become impaired, requiring write-downs that would reduce our operating income. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill amounts annually, or more frequently when evidence of potential impairment exists. The impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. A decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill and, as a result, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. See \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d in Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information.\nGovernment regulation on environmental matters regarding recycling or environmental sustainability policies could impact our business. Future government regulations mandating the use or limitations of certain materials could impact our manufacturing processes or the technologies we use forcing faster development and adoption of alternative materials or assets used in the production of our products.\n12/ATR\n2021 Form 10-K\nFuture government regulations of healthcare cost containment policies may impact our pharmaceutical sales. Review by governments of the number of drugs and prices thereof that will be paid by their insurance systems could affect future sales to the pharmaceutical industry and thereby adversely affect prices of and demand for our pharmaceutical products.\nWe may be adversely affected by the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) or other Interbank Rates (IBORs) to Risk Free Rates for our variable rate loans, derivative contracts and other financial assets and liabilities. We have loans, derivative contracts and other financial instruments which are directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR to establish their interest rate and/or value. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which is the LIBOR administrator's regulator, has announced that the publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors and all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors have ceased effective January 1, 2022, with the remaining most common U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors (overnight and one, three, six and twelve months) ceasing immediately after June 30, 2023.\nThe transition from LIBOR may cause us to incur increased costs and additional risk. Our revolving credit facility contains provisions allowing for a transition away from U.S. dollar LIBOR, but those provisions are contingent on our ability to negotiate new benchmark rates, spreads and calculation methods with the administrative agent. Although the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") has been identified as a recommended alternative reference rate to U.S. dollar LIBOR, SOFR has a limited history and SOFR-based reference rates may perform differently from U.S. dollar LIBOR, which may affect our net interest expense, change our market risk profile and require changes to our risk, pricing and hedging strategies.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOwnership by Certain Significant Stockholders. Currently, Aptar has four institutional stockholders who each own between 5% and 11% of our outstanding common stock. None of these stockholders have direct representation on our Board of Directors. If one of these stockholders decides to sell significant volumes of our stock, this could put downward pressure on the price of the stock.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new tax legislation or rules or exposure to additional tax liabilities. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate may be subject to change. Our effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.\nWe are also subject to examination of our returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase in jurisdictions where we have significant operations, or if the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our financial condition and operating results could be materially, adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 79133, "SIC": 3089, "TIC": "ATR"}
