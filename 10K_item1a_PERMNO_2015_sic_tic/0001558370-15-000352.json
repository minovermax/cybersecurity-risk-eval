{"cik": "1366246", "company": "GLU MOBILE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which may affect our future financial performance. If any of the events or circumstances described below occurs, our business and financial performance could be harmed, our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline. The risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face. There may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our business and financial performance. Because of the risks and uncertainties discussed below, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nWe have a history of net losses, may incur substantial net losses in the future and our recent profitability and growth may not be indicative of future profitability or growth.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception, including a net loss of $20.5 million in 2012, and a net loss of $19.9 million in 2013. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $244.1 million. Although we achieved profitability and significant growth in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, this profitability and growth was primarily related to the success of our Kim Kardashian: Hollywood game, and we do not expect to maintain the growth we experienced in 2014. In 2014, our costs increased in absolute dollars over 2013 levels, and we expect this trend to continue in 2015 as we implement additional initiatives designed to increase revenues, such as increasing the number of games we develop, increased payments of upfront license fees or minimum guarantees to secure licenses to well-known third-party brands, properties and other content, developing games with greater complexity and higher production values, making investments related to our games-as-a-service, or GaaS capabilities, increasing the amount we spend in acquiring new players and otherwise marketing our new titles (particularly since advertising costs in our industry have generally been rising). In connection with increasing the number of games we are able to develop and enhancing our development efforts, we have announced a plan to hire six new development teams in 2015, and we expect to hire around 135 additional employees to staff those new teams and to bolster existing studio teams and our central services in San Francisco. If our revenues do not increase to offset these additional expenses, if we experience unexpected increases in operating expenses or if we are required to take additional charges related to impairments or restructurings, we will incur losses and will not be able to maintain profitability on a sustained basis. If we are unable to significantly increase our revenues or reduce our expenses, it will continue to negatively affect our operating results and our ability to sustain profitability.\nWe have a relatively new and evolving business model.\nIn early 2010, we changed our business model to focus on becoming a leading developer and publisher of \u201cfree-to-play\u201d games for smartphones, tablets and other next-generation platforms. Free-to-play games are games that a player can download and play for free, but which allow players to access a variety of additional content and features for a fee and to engage with various advertisements and offers that generate revenues for us. We launched our first free-to-play titles in the fourth quarter of 2010, so we have a relatively short history operating under this business model. This limits the experience upon which we can draw when making operating decisions. In addition, part of our strategy is to continue transitioning towards becoming a GaaS company, and we may not successfully execute this transition. Our efforts to develop free-to-play games and transition towards becoming a GaaS company may prove unsuccessful or, even if successful, it may take more time than we anticipate to achieve significant revenues because, among other reasons:\n\u00b7\nwe may have difficulty optimizing the monetization of our games due to our relatively limited experience creating games that include micro-transaction capabilities, advertising and offers, as well as our limited experience in offering the features that are often associated with free-to-play games published by GaaS companies, such as tournaments, live events and more frequent content updates;\n\u00b7\nwe intend to continue to develop the majority of our games based upon our own intellectual property, rather than well-known licensed brands and properties, and we may encounter difficulties in generating sufficient consumer interest in and downloads of our games, particularly since we have had relatively limited success\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ngenerating significant revenues from games based on our own intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nmany well-funded public and private companies have released, or plan to release, free-to-play games, including those provided under the GaaS model, and this competition will make it more difficult for us to differentiate our games and derive significant revenues from them;\n\u00b7\nfree-to-play games, including those delivered as a service, have a relatively limited history, and it is unclear how popular this style of game will become or remain or its revenue potential;\n\u00b7\nour free-to-play strategy assumes that a large number of players will download our games because they are free and that we will then be able to effectively monetize the games; however, players may not widely download our games for a variety of reasons, including poor consumer reviews or other negative publicity, ineffective or insufficient marketing efforts, lack of sufficient community features, lack of prominent storefront featuring and the relatively large file size of some of our games-our thick-client games often utilize a significant amount of the available memory on a user\u2019s device, and due to the inherent limitations of the smartphone platforms and telecommunications networks, which at best only allow applications that are less than 100 megabytes to be downloaded over a carrier\u2019s wireless network, players must download one of our thick-client games either via a wireless Internet (wifi) connection or initially to their computer and then side-loaded to their device;\n\u00b7\neven if our games are widely downloaded, we may fail to retain users or optimize the monetization of these games for a variety of reasons, including poor game design or quality, lack of community features, gameplay issues such as game unavailability, long load times or an unexpected termination of the game due to data server or other technical issues, or our failure to effectively respond and adapt to changing user preferences through game updates;\n\u00b7\nwe may have difficulty hiring the additional monetization, live operations, server technology, user experience and product management personnel that we require to support our continued transition to becoming a GaaS company, or may face difficulties in developing our GaaS technology platform and incorporating it into our products;\n\u00b7\nwe will depend on the proper and continued functioning of our own servers and third-party infrastructure to operate our connected games that are delivered as a service;\n\u00b7\nthe billing and provisioning capabilities of some smartphones and tablets are currently not optimized to enable users to purchase games or make in-app purchases, which make it difficult for users of these smartphones and tablets to purchase our games or make in-app purchases and could reduce our addressable market, at least in the short term; and\n\u00b7\nthe Federal Trade Commission has indicated that it intends to review issues related to in-app purchases, particularly with respect to games that are marketed primarily to minors (for example, the FTC reached a settlement with Apple in January 2014 and with Google in September 2014 on this issue), and the commission might issue rules significantly restricting or even prohibiting in-app purchases or name us as a defendant in a future class-action lawsuit.\nIf we do not achieve a sufficient return on our investment with respect to our free-to-play business model, it will negatively affect our operating results and may require us to formulate a new business strategy.\nWe rely on a very small portion of our total players for nearly all of our revenues that we derive from in-app purchases.\nSince our free-to-play games can be downloaded and played for free, we have succeeded in generating a significant\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nnumber of game installations and significant user-base growth. However, we rely on a very small portion of our total players for nearly all of our revenues derived from in-app purchases (as opposed to advertisements and incentivized offers). Since the launch of our first free-to-play titles in the fourth quarter of 2010, the percentage of unique paying players for our largest revenue-generating free-to-play games has typically been less than 2%, when measured as the number of unique paying users on a given day divided by the number of unique users on that day, though this percentage fluctuates, and it may be higher than 2% for certain of our games during specific, relatively short time periods, such as immediately following worldwide launch or the week following content updates, marketing campaigns or certain other events. To significantly increase our revenues, we must increase the number of players who convert into a paying player by making in-app purchases, increase the amount that our paying players spend in our games and/or increase the length of time our players generally play our games. We have to date encountered difficulties with game monetization (for example, developing a sufficient quantity and variety of virtual goods to enable a relatively large scale of in-app purchases by an individual user). We might not succeed in our efforts to increase the monetization rates of our users, particularly if we do not succeed in our transition to becoming a GaaS company. If we are unable to convert non-paying players into paying players, if we are unable to retain our paying players or if the average amount of revenues that we generate from our players does not increase or declines, our business may not grow, our financial results will suffer, and our stock price may decline.\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from Apple\u2019s App Store and the Google Play Store, and if we are unable to maintain a good relationship with each of Apple and Google or if either of these storefronts were unavailable for any prolonged period of time, our business will suffer.\nThe majority of our smartphone revenues is derived from Apple\u2019s iOS platform, which accounted for 61.8% of our total revenues in 2014 compared with 59.6% of our total revenues in 2013. We generated the majority of these iOS-related revenues from the Apple App Store, which represented 52.2% and 50.1% of our total revenues in 2014 and 2013, respectively, with the significant majority of such revenues derived from in-app purchases. We generated the balance of our iOS-related revenues from offers and advertisements in games distributed on the Apple App Store and, to a far lesser extent, sales of premium games. In addition, we derived approximately 35.4% and 30.5% of our total revenues in 2014 and 2013, respectively, from the Android platform. We generated the majority of our Android-related revenues from the Google Play Store, which represented approximately 24.8% and 19.2% of our total revenues for 2014 and 2013, respectively, with the significant majority of such revenues derived from in-app purchases. We believe that we have good relationships with each of Apple and Google, which have contributed to the majority of our games released in 2014 being featured on their storefronts when they were commercially released. If we do not continue to receive prominent featuring, users may find it more difficult to discover our games and we may not generate significant revenues from them. We may also be required to spend significantly more on marketing campaigns to generate substantial revenues on these platforms. In addition, currently neither Apple nor Google charges a publisher when it features one of their apps. If either Apple or Google were to charge publishers to feature an app, it could cause our marketing expenses to increase considerably. Accordingly, any change or deterioration in our relationship with Apple or Google could materially harm our business and likely cause our stock price to decline.\nWe also rely on the continued functioning of the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. In the past these digital storefronts have been unavailable for short periods of time or experienced issues with their in-app purchasing functionality. For example, on March 11, 2015, the Apple App Store experienced an approximately 12-hour global outage, which resulted in players and potential players of our games being unable to download our games and unable to make in-app purchases within our games during such outage. If either of these events recurs on a prolonged basis or other similar issues arise that impact our ability to generate revenues from these storefronts, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results. In addition, if these storefront operators fail to provide high levels of service, our players\u2019 ability to access our games may be interrupted or players may not receive the virtual currency or goods for which they have paid, which may adversely affect our brand.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe operators of digital storefronts on which we publish our free-to-play games and the advertising channels through which we acquire some of our players in many cases have the unilateral ability to change and interpret the terms of our and others\u2019 contracts with them.\nWe distribute our free-to-play games through direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, for which the distribution terms and conditions are often \u201cclick through\u201d agreements that we are not able to negotiate with the storefront operator. For example, we are subject to each of Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s standard click-through terms and conditions for application developers, which govern the promotion, distribution and operation of apps, including our games, on their storefronts. Each of Apple and Google can unilaterally change its standard terms and conditions with no prior notice to us. In addition, the agreement terms can be vague and subject to changing interpretations by the storefront operator. Further, these storefront operators typically have the right to prohibit a developer from distributing its applications on its storefront if the developer violates its standard terms and conditions. For example, in the second quarter of 2011, Apple began prohibiting certain types of virtual currency-incented advertising offers in games sold on the Apple App Store. These offers accounted for approximately one-third of our smartphone revenues during the three months ended June 30, 2011, and our inability to subsequently use such offers negatively impacted our smartphone revenues thereafter. In addition, Apple informed us early in the fourth quarter of 2012 that we could no longer include links to Tapjoy\u2019s HTML5 website in our games, which has since negatively impacted our ability to generate revenue through incented offers. Most recently, Apple has implemented certain restrictions related to games that include guns, including changing its game rating methodology, which has resulted in all of our games that include gun violence receiving a 17+ rating, and prohibiting certain depictions of guns in game icons and other storefront art; these restrictions, could potentially negatively impact the number of people playing these \u201cshooter\u201d games and the revenues we generate from these games. In addition, during the second quarter of 2014, there were reports that Apple was considering prohibiting certain types of virtual currency-incented video advertising in games sold on the Apple App Store. These incented video advertisements generate a meaningful percentage of our overall smartphone revenues, and any prohibition of these advertisements would have had a negative impact on our smartphone revenues. If Apple or Google, or any other key storefront operator, determines that we or one of our key vendors are violating its standard terms and conditions, by a new interpretation or otherwise or prohibits us from distributing our games on its storefront, it would materially harm our business and likely cause our stock price to significantly decline.\nIn addition, in the first quarter of 2014, Facebook prohibited HasOffers, whose software development kit we had incorporated into our games to track advertising metrics, from participating in Facebook\u2019s mobile measurement program because Facebook asserted that HasOffers had violated its agreement with Facebook. As a result, we removed HasOffers\u2019 software development kit from our games and replaced it with software from a new vendor. While this change did not adversely impact our revenues or operations, any similar changes or prohibitions in the future could negatively impact our revenues or otherwise materially harm our business, and we may not receive significant or any advance warning of such changes.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nApple\u2019s requirement that beginning February 1, 2015 all new applications, and beginning June 1, 2015 all updates to existing applications, submitted to the Apple App Store must include 64-bit support and be built with the iOS 8 software development kit, could harm our business.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, Apple informed developers that beginning on February 1, 2015 all new applications, and beginning June 1, 2015 all updates to existing applications, submitted to the Apple App Store must include 64-bit support and be built with the iOS 8 software development kit. We have not in the past built our games to include 64-bit support nor did the Unity development engine that we utilize to create many of our games support 64-bit development; however, we are currently working with Unity to ensure that we meet Apple\u2019s requirement. If we fail to implement 64-bit support for all of our games currently under development that we intend to launch after February 1, 2015 as well as any of our currently released games that we intend to update after June 1, 2015, it would negatively impact our revenues in 2015 and potentially beyond. In addition, due to the expense involved in supporting 64-bit development, we will likely not continue updating certain of our existing games after June 1, 2015 that we otherwise would have continued to update due to the cost of upgrading such games to 64-bit versus our expected returns for such games, which will cause the revenues that we generate from these games to decline more quickly than they otherwise would have. Furthermore, building our games to support 64-bit development will increase the file size of our games, which could reduce the number of downloads of these games, particularly if we are unable to keep the size of the games below 100 megabytes, which is the maximum file size that can currently be downloaded over any carrier\u2019s wireless network.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do.\nDeveloping, distributing and selling mobile games is a highly competitive business, characterized by frequent product introductions and rapidly emerging new platforms, technologies and storefronts. For players, we compete primarily on the basis of game quality, brand and customer reviews. We compete for promotional and storefront placement based on these factors, as well as our relationship with the digital storefront owner, historical performance, perception of sales potential and relationships with licensors of brands, properties and other content. For content and brand licensors, we compete based on royalty and other economic terms, perceptions of development quality, porting abilities, speed of execution, distribution breadth and relationships with storefront owners. We also compete for experienced and talented employees.\nWe compete with a continually increasing number of companies, including Activision, DeNA, Disney, Electronic Arts (EA Mobile), Gameloft, GREE, GungHo Online Entertainment, King Digital Entertainment, Nexon, Warner Brothers and Zynga and many well-funded private companies, including Kabam, Machine Zone, Rovio, Storm 8/Team Lava and Supercell. In addition, we face competition from online game developers and distributors who are primarily focused on specific international markets, such as Tencent Holdings Limited in Asia. We could also face increased competition if those companies choose to compete more directly in the United States or the other markets that are significant to us or if large companies with significant online presences such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook or Yahoo, choose to enter or expand in the games space or develop competing games.\nIn addition, given the open nature of the development and distribution for smartphones and tablets and the relatively low barriers to entry, we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch games and other content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. As an example of the competition that we face, it has been estimated that more than 1.4 million applications, including more than 300,000 active games, were available on Apple\u2019s U.S. App Store as of December 31, 2014. The proliferation of titles in these open developer channels makes it difficult for us to differentiate ourselves from other developers and to compete for players without substantially increasing our marketing expenses and development costs.\nSome of our competitors and our potential competitors have one or more advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, which include:\n\u00b7\nsignificantly greater financial resources;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\ngreater experience with the free-to-play games and GaaS business models and more effective game monetization;\n\u00b7\nstronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide;\n\u00b7\ngreater experience and effectiveness integrating community features into their games, operating as a GaaS company and increasing the revenues derived from their users;\n\u00b7\nthe capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and non-mobile products;\n\u00b7\nlarger installed user bases from their existing mobile games;\n\u00b7\nlarger installed user bases from related platforms, such as console gaming or social networking websites, to which they can market and sell mobile games;\n\u00b7\nmore substantial intellectual property of their own from which they can develop games without having to pay royalties;\n\u00b7\nlower labor and development costs and better overall economies of scale;\n\u00b7\ngreater platform-specific focus, experience and expertise; and\n\u00b7\nbroader global distribution and presence.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively or we are not as successful as our competitors in our target markets, our sales could decline, our margins could decline and we could lose market share, any of which would materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur financial results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict, which in turn could cause volatility in our stock price.\nOur revenues and operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. In addition, we may not be able to accurately predict our future revenues or results of operations. We base our current and future expense levels on our internal operating plans and sales forecasts, and our operating costs are to a large extent fixed. As a result, we may not be able to reduce our costs sufficiently to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenues, and even a small shortfall in revenues could disproportionately and adversely affect financial results for that quarter.\nIn addition to other risk factors discussed in this section, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly results include:\n\u00b7\nour ability to increase the number of our paying players and the amount that each paying player spends in our games;\n\u00b7\nthe popularity and monetization rates of our new games released during the quarter and the ability of games released in prior periods to sustain their popularity and monetization rates;\n\u00b7\nthe number and timing of new games released by us and our competitors, particularly those games that may represent a significant portion of revenues in a quarter, which timing can be impacted by internal development delays, shifts in product strategy and how quickly digital storefront operators review and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\napprove our games for commercial release;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the prominence of storefront featuring for our games and those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nthe loss of, or changes to, one of our distribution platforms;\n\u00b7\nchanges to the Apple iOS platform or the Google Android platform that we are not able to adapt to our game offerings;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in the size and rate of growth of overall consumer demand for smartphones, tablets, games and related content;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the mix of revenues derived from games based on original intellectual property versus licensed intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the mix of revenues derived from in-app purchases, advertisements and offers, which mix often depends on the nature of new titles launched during the quarter;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the mix of revenues derived from first party titles and third party titles;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the amount of money we spend marketing our titles in a particular quarter, including the average amount we pay to acquire each new user, as well as changes in the timing of these marketing expenses within the quarter;\n\u00b7\ndecisions by us to incur additional expenses, such as increases in research and development, or unanticipated increases in vendor-related costs, such as hosting fees;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of successful mobile device launches;\n\u00b7\nthe seasonality of our industry;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting rules, such as those governing recognition of revenue, including the period of time over which we recognize revenue for in-app purchases of virtual currency and goods within certain of our games;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of charges related to any future impairments of goodwill, intangible assets, prepaid royalties and guarantees; for example, in 2012 we impaired $3.6 million of our goodwill related to our APAC reporting unit and in 2013 and 2014 we impaired $435,000 and $257,000, respectively, related to contractual minimum guarantee commitments in our Glu Publishing business; and\n\u00b7\nmacro-economic fluctuations in the United States and global economies, including those that impact discretionary consumer spending.\nIf we fail to develop and publish new mobile games that achieve market acceptance, as well as continue to enhance our existing games, particularly our most successful games, our revenues would suffer.\nOur business depends on developing and publishing mobile games that consumers will download and spend time and money playing. We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, analytics and marketing to introduce new games and continue to update our successful free-to-play games, and we often must make decisions about these matters well in advance of product release to timely implement them. Our success depends, in part, on unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, including consumer preferences, competing games, new mobile platforms and the availability of other entertainment activities. If our games do not meet consumer expectations, or they\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nare not brought to market in a timely and effective manner, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. Even if our games are successfully introduced and initially adopted, a failure to continue to update them with compelling content or a subsequent shift in the entertainment preferences of consumers could cause a decline in our games\u2019 popularity that could materially reduce our revenues and harm our business, operating results and financial condition, which effect is magnified for our most successful games, such as Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, Racing Rivals and Deer Hunter 2014. It is difficult to predict when and how quickly one of our games will decline. As a result of the life cycle of our games, our business depends on our ability to consistently and timely launch new games or versions of games that achieve significant popularity and have the potential to become franchise games. If rates of decline are higher than expected in a particular quarterly period and/or we experience delays in the launch of new games that we expect to offset these declines, we may not meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for a given quarter. In addition, our Kim Kardashian: Hollywood game benefitted significantly from awareness of the game through media coverage and social media channels, and such viral success can be difficult to predict or to repeat in the future, even for games based on highly popular celebrities such as Katy Perry. Furthermore, we compete for the discretionary spending of consumers, who face a vast array of entertainment choices, including games played on personal computers and consoles, television, movies, sports and the Internet. If we are unable to sustain sufficient interest in our games compared to other forms of entertainment, our business and financial results would be seriously harmed.\nIf we do not successfully establish and maintain awareness of our brand and games, if we incur excessive expenses promoting and maintaining our brand or our games or if our games contain defects or objectionable content, our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe believe that establishing and maintaining our brand is critical to establishing a direct relationship with players who purchase our products from direct-to-consumer channels and to maintaining our existing relationships with distributors and content licensors, as well as potentially developing new such relationships. Increasing awareness of our brand and recognition of our games is particularly important in connection with our strategic focus of developing games based on our own intellectual property. Our ability to promote the Glu brand and increase recognition of our games depends on our ability to develop high-quality, engaging games. If consumers, digital storefront owners and branded content owners do not perceive our existing games as high-quality or if we introduce new games that are not favorably received by them, then we may not succeed in building brand recognition and brand loyalty in the marketplace. In addition, globalizing and extending our brand and recognition of our games is costly and involves extensive management time to execute successfully, particularly as we expand our efforts to increase awareness of our brand and games among international consumers. Although we make significant sales and marketing expenditures in connection with the launch of our games, these efforts may not succeed in increasing awareness of our brand or the new games. If we fail to increase and maintain brand awareness and consumer recognition of our games, our potential revenues could be limited, our costs could increase and our business, operating results and financial condition could suffer.\nIn addition, if a game contains objectionable content, we could experience damage to our reputation and brand. The majority of our successful free-to-play games are in the action genre, and we expect that the majority of the games that we will release in 2015 will be in that category. Some of these games contain violence or other content that certain consumers may find objectionable. For example, Apple has assigned each of our shooter games a 17-and-older rating due to its violence. In addition, Google required us to submit two versions of our Blood & Glory and Contract Killer: Zombies games, one of which did not depict blood. Despite these ratings and precautions, consumers may be offended by certain of our game content and children to whom these games are not targeted may choose to play them without parental permission nonetheless. In addition, our employees or employees of outside developers could include hidden features in one our games without our knowledge, which might contain profanity, graphic violence, sexually explicit or otherwise objectionable material. If consumers believe that a game we published contains objectionable content, it could harm our brand, consumers could refuse to buy it or demand a refund, and could pressure the digital storefront operators to no longer allow us to publish the game on their platforms. Similarly, if any of our games are introduced with defects or have playability issues, we may receive negative user reviews and our brand may be damaged. These issues could be exacerbated if our customer service department does not timely and adequately address issues that our players have encountered with our games.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe have depended on a small number of games for a significant portion of our revenues in recent fiscal periods. If these games do not continue to succeed or we do not release highly successful new games, our revenues would decline.\nIn the mobile gaming industry, new games are frequently introduced, but a relatively small number of games account for a significant portion of industry sales. Similarly, a significant portion of our revenues comes from a limited number of games, although the games in that group have shifted over time. Despite only having been launched in June 2014, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood was our largest revenue generating title in 2014, with Deer Hunter 2014 also accounting for more than 10% of our revenues in 2014; no other game accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2014. While we expect Kim Kardashian: Hollywood to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues during the first quarter of 2015, we expect revenues from this title to continue to decline. We expect revenues from new game releases and content updates to partially offset the decline, but do not expect such offsets to enable us to maintain current revenue levels during the first quarter of 2015. In addition, revenues from Kim Kardashian: Hollywood are in part tied to the continued popularity of Kim Kardashian West and her marketing efforts though social media and other channels, and we have little to no control over these matters and they are hard for us to predict. Accordingly, we must continue to launch new games that generate significant revenues to continue to grow revenues in the future, which we have sometimes failed to do. For example, in the third quarter of 2012, we launched 11 new games, only two of which generated significant revenues, which, in part, contributed to our revenues declining from the second quarter of 2012. Developing and launching our games and providing future content updates requires us to invest significant time and resources with no guarantee that our efforts will result in significant revenues. If our new games are not successful or if we are not able to cost-effectively extend the lives of our successful games, our revenues could be limited and our business and operating results would suffer.\nWe rely on a combination of our own servers and technology and third party infrastructure to operate our games. If we experience any system or network failures, cyber attacks or any other interruption to our games, it could reduce our sales, increase costs or result in a loss of revenues or end users of our games.\nWe rely on digital storefronts and other third-party networks to deliver games to our players and on their or other third parties\u2019 billing systems to track and account for our game downloads. We also rely on our own servers and third-party infrastructure to operate our connected games, and our reliance on such third-party infrastructure and our GaaS technology platform will increase as we continue transitioning to becoming a GaaS company. In particular, a significant portion of our game traffic is hosted by Amazon Web Services, which service provides server redundancy and uses multiple locations on various distinct power grids. Amazon may terminate its agreement with us upon 30 days\u2019 notice. Amazon experienced a power outage during the second quarter of 2012, which affected the playability of our games for approximately one day. In addition, Amazon effected a large scale maintenance reboot of a portion of its systems during September 2014 to remedy a security flaw. While neither of these events adversely impacted our business, a similar outage of a longer duration could. In addition, the operation of our online-only games that we began releasing in the fourth quarter of 2013 will depend on the continued functionality of our GaaS technology platform. As a result, we could experience unexpected technical problems with regard to the operation of our online-only games, particularly if the number of concurrent users playing our games is significantly more than we anticipate. Any technical problem with, cyber attack on, or loss of access to these third parties\u2019 or our systems, servers or other technologies, including the GaaS technology platform, could result in the inability of end users to download or play our games, cause interruption to gameplay, prevent the completion of billing for a game or result in the loss of users\u2019 virtual currency or other in-app purchases, interfere with access to some aspects of our games or result in the theft of end-user personal information. For example, in July 2014, users could not play our Kim Kardashian: Hollywood game for about six hours due to a problem with one of our servers, and in November 2014 and March 2015, we experienced similar outages with respect to our Racing Rivals game. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2013, our Eternity Warriors 3 title was inoperable for approximately eight consecutive hours due to technical issues with our GaaS platform. We were also the victim of a cyber attack in early November 2014, when an animal rights group took down our main website and user forums. In October 2013, we were also the victim of a \u201cCryptoLocker\u201d ransomware attack that temporarily prevented our access to sensitive company files. Although these incidents did not result in a material loss of revenues, any future incidents, particularly of longer duration, could damage our brand and reputation and result in a material loss of revenues. Further, if virtual assets are lost, or if users do not receive their purchased virtual currency, we may be required to issue refunds, we may receive negative publicity and game ratings, we may lose players of our games, and we may become subject to\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nregulatory investigation or class action litigation, any of which would negatively affect our business. Any of these problems could harm our reputation or cause us to lose players or revenues or incur substantial repair costs and distract management from operating our business.\nIf we fail to maintain and enhance our capabilities for porting games to a broad array of mobile devices, particularly those running the Android operating system, our revenues and financial results could suffer.\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from the sale of virtual goods within our games for smartphones and tablets that run Apple\u2019s iOS or Google\u2019s Android operating system. Unlike the Apple ecosystem in which Apple controls both the device (iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad) and the storefront (Apple\u2019s App Store), the Android ecosystem is highly fragmented since a large number of OEMs manufacture and sell Android-based devices that run a variety of versions of the Android operating system, and there are many Android-based storefronts in addition to the Google Play Store. For us to sell our games to the widest possible audience of Android users, we must port our games to a significant portion of the more than 1,000 Android-based devices that are commercially available, many of which have different technical requirements. Since the number of Android-based smartphones and tablets shipped worldwide is growing significantly, it is important that we maintain and enhance our porting capabilities, which could require us to invest considerable resources in this area. These additional costs could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we must continue to increase the efficiency of our porting processes or it may take us longer to port games to an equivalent number of devices, which would negatively impact our margins. If we fail to maintain or enhance our porting capabilities, our revenues and financial results could suffer.\nWe use a game development engine licensed from Unity Technologies to create many of our games. If we experience any prolonged technical issues with this engine or if we lose access to this engine for any reason, it could delay our game development efforts and cause our financial results to fall below expectations for a quarterly or annual period, which would likely cause our stock price to decline.\nWe use a game development engine licensed from Unity Technologies to create many of our games, and we expect to continue to use this engine for the foreseeable future. Because we do not own this engine, we do not control its operation or maintenance. As a result, any prolonged technical issues with this engine might not be resolved quickly, despite the fact that we have contractual service level commitments from Unity. In addition, although Unity cannot terminate our agreement absent an uncured material breach of the agreement by us, we could lose access to this engine under certain circumstances, such as a natural disaster that impacts Unity or a bankruptcy event. If we experience any prolonged issues with the operation of the Unity game development engine or if we lose access to this engine for any reason, it could delay our game development efforts and cause us to not meet revenue expectations for a quarterly or annual period, which would likely cause our stock price to decline. Further, if one of our competitors acquired Unity, the acquiring company would be less likely to renew our agreement, which could impact our game development efforts in the future, particularly with respect to sequels to games that were created on the Unity engine.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from advertisements and offers that are incorporated into our free-to-play games through relationships with third parties. If we lose the ability to provide these advertisements and offers for any reason, or if any events occur that negatively impact the revenues we receive from these sources, it would negatively impact our operating results.\nWe derive revenues from our free-to-play games through in-app purchases, advertisements and offers. We incorporate advertisements and offers into our games by implementing third parties\u2019 software development kits. We rely on these third parties to provide us with a sufficient inventory of advertisements and offers to meet the demand of our user base. If we exhaust the available inventory of these third parties, it will negatively impact our revenues. If our relationship with any of these third parties terminates for any reason, or if the commercial terms of our relationships do not continue to be renewed on favorable terms, we would need to locate and implement other third party solutions, which could negatively impact our revenues, at least in the short term. Furthermore, the revenues that we derive from advertisements and offers is subject to seasonality, as companies\u2019 advertising budgets are generally highest during the fourth quarter and decline significantly in the first quarter of the following year, which negatively impacts our revenues in the first quarter (and conversely significantly increases our marketing expenses in the fourth quarter).\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn addition, the actions of the storefront operators can also negatively impact the revenues that we generate from advertisements and offers. For example, in the second quarter of 2011, Apple began prohibiting certain types of virtual currency-incented advertising offers in games sold on the Apple App Store. These offers accounted for approximately one-third of our revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2011, and our inability to use such offers has negatively impacted our revenues. In addition, during the second quarter of 2014, there were reports that Apple was considering prohibiting certain types of virtual currency-incented video advertising in games sold on the Apple App Store. These incented video advertisements generate a meaningful percentage of our overall revenues, and any prohibition of these advertisements would have had a negative impact on our revenues. Any similar changes in the future that impact our revenues that we generate from advertisements and offers could materially harm our business.\nWe may not, or may be unable to, renew our existing brand and content licenses when they expire and may not choose to obtain additional licenses, which could negatively impact our revenues if we fail to replace such revenues with revenues from games based on our own intellectual property.\nAlthough we generated 93.3% of our revenues from games based on our own intellectual property during 2013, that percentage declined to 62.7% for 2014, largely due to the success of Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and, to a lesser extent, Robocop: The Official Game, Racing Rivals, and Tap Sports: Baseball. We expect our revenues derived from games based on third party intellectual property to increase further in 2015, as we expect to continue to derive significant revenue from Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and to release games based on newly licensed brands, properties and other content, including through our partnership with Katy Perry, and games based on the James Bond and Terminator motion picture franchises and other third party celebrities, brands and content, which, if successful, would further increase the revenues we generate from third party intellectual property. Certain of our licenses expire at various times during the next several years, and we may be unable to renew these licenses on terms favorable to us or at all. In addition, these licensors could decide to license to our competitors or develop and publish their own mobile games, competing with us in the marketplace. Failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses or to obtain additional licenses would prevent us from continuing to offer our current licensed games and introducing new mobile games based on such licensed content, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSecuring license agreements to develop, publish and market games based on third-party licensed brands, properties and other content, such as with Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, Robocop: The Official Game, Hercules: The Official Game and our forthcoming games based on the James Bond movie franchise and Katy Perry, among others, typically requires that we make minimum guaranteed royalty payments, and to the extent such payments become impaired, our operating results would be harmed.\nIn connection with recently announced partnerships and other potential partnerships with celebrities and other third-party brands, properties and content, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant minimum guaranteed royalty requirements at a rate substantially higher than in prior years. As a result, we may incur increased levels of impairments on such prepaid royalty guarantees if our forecasts for these games are lower than we anticipated at the time we entered into the agreements. For example, in 2013 and 2014 we impaired $435,000 and $257,000, respectively, related to contractual minimum guarantee commitments in our Glu Publishing business. As a result, our impairments on prepaid royalty guarantees may rise in 2015 or in later periods.\nWe publish games developed by third parties, which exposes us to a number of potential operational and legal risks.\nOur Glu Publishing team is focused on entering into relationships with developers of games, primarily in Asian and Eastern European markets, where we will localize and globally publish those games. Our Glu Publishing business exposes us to a number of potential operational and legal risks. For example, we may be required to provide third party developers with upfront license fees or non-recoupable minimum guarantees in order to obtain the rights to publish their games, and we may incur significant costs marketing these games after they have been commercially launched. The games may not be commercially successful if they do not appeal to a Western audience, if our limited experience in publishing other developers\u2019 games leads to unexpected results or for any other reason, which would negatively impact our operating results. Further, in the third quarter of 2013, we were required to take an impairment charge of $435,000 related to certain minimum guarantee commitments. In addition, if any of the games created by third party developers\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nwith which we work infringe intellectual property owned by others, or otherwise violate any third party\u2019s rights or any applicable laws and regulations, such as laws with respect to data collection and privacy, we would be exposed to potential legal risks by publishing these games.\nOur business and growth may suffer if we are unable to hire and retain key personnel.\nOur future success will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to retain and motivate our key personnel, namely our management team, particularly Niccolo de Masi, our President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as experienced game development personnel. In addition, to grow our business, execute on our business strategy and replace departing employees, we must identify, hire and retain qualified personnel, particularly additional monetization, live operations, server technology, user experience and product management personnel to support our continued transition to becoming a GaaS company. Competition for qualified management, game development and other staff is intense. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel may be particularly difficult for us if our stock price remains relatively depressed, since individuals may elect to seek employment with other companies that they believe have better long-term prospects. Competitors have in the past and may in the future attempt to recruit our employees, and our management and key employees are not bound by agreements that could prevent them from terminating their employment at any time. As we continue to develop expertise in free-to-play mobile gaming, operating a GaaS company and monetization in particular, our competitors may increasingly seek to recruit our employees, particularly from our development studios. In addition, we do not maintain a key-person life insurance policy on any of our officers. Our business and growth may suffer if we are unable to hire and retain key personnel.\nAny restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives that we undertake may not deliver the results we expect, and these actions may adversely affect our business.\nWe have implemented a number of restructurings during the last several years, most recently in the third quarter of 2014, in which we implemented certain restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives to streamline operations and improve cost efficiencies. The restructuring included a reduction in personnel supporting our centralized services related to our GaaS technology and the reduction of a senior executive position. While we remain committed to developing our GaaS capabilities, our experiences with product launches in 2014 have led us to believe the most effective way to implement our GaaS strategy is on a game by game basis, giving our studios more autonomy on the level of GaaS implementation for each particular game rather than mandating the use of GaaS technology as a global requirement from headquarters. We plan to continue to manage costs to better and more efficiently manage our business. This most recent restructuring plan and other such efforts could result in disruptions to our operations and adversely affect our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that the cost reduction and streamlining initiatives will be as successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect or that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or streamlining. If our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses, our operating results will suffer.\nWe may need to raise additional capital or borrow funds to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital or borrow funds on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $70.9 million of cash and cash equivalents. If our cash and cash equivalents and cash inflows are insufficient to meet our cash requirements or if we wish to strengthen our balance sheet, including to potentially pursue additional acquisitions, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially pursuant to our existing universal shelf registration statement, and we may be unable to do so on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. Equity financings would dilute our existing stockholders, and the holders of new securities may receive rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of existing stockholders. Alternatively, we may wish to enter into a credit facility or other debt arrangement, and we may be unable to procure one on terms that are acceptable to us, particularly in light of the current credit market conditions. If we require new sources of financing but they are insufficient or unavailable, we would be required to modify our operating plans to align them with available resources, which would harm our ability to grow our business.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves.\nOur reported financial results are impacted by the accounting policies promulgated by the SEC and accounting standards bodies and the methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. Due to recent economic events, the frequency of accounting policy changes may accelerate, including conversion to unified international accounting standards. Policies affecting revenue recognition have affected, and could further significantly affect, the way we account for revenue. For example, the accounting for revenue derived from smartphone platforms and free-to-play games, particularly with regard to revenues generated from online digital storefronts, is still evolving and, in some cases, uncertain. In particular, we were required to file an amendment to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 to restate or revise the financial statements contained in those reports (including for the year ended December 31, 2011) because we did not correctly apply the applicable revenue recognition accounting guidance relating to our smartphone revenues. While we believe that we are now correctly accounting for our smartphone revenues, this is an area that continues to involve significant discussion among accounting professionals and which is not completely settled. It is possible that the relative application, interpretation and weighting of the factors that relate to whether we should be considered the principal in the sales transaction of games sold through digital storefronts may evolve, and we may in the future conclude that our new accounting policy for smartphone revenue, as reflected in the restated financial statements, is incorrect, which could result in another restatement of affected financial statements. In addition, we currently defer revenues related to virtual goods and currency over the average playing period of paying users, which approximates the estimated weighted average useful life of the transaction. While we believe our estimates are reasonable based on available game player information, we may revise such estimates in the future as our games\u2019 operation periods change. Any adjustments arising from changes in the estimates of the lives of these virtual items would be applied to the current quarter and prospectively on the basis that such changes are caused by new information indicating a change in the game player behavior patterns of our paying users. Any changes in our estimates of useful lives of these virtual items may result in our revenues being recognized on a basis different from prior periods\u2019 and may cause our operating results to fluctuate. As we enhance, expand and diversify our business and product offerings, the application of existing or future financial accounting standards, particularly those relating to the way we account for our smartphone revenues, could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements. In connection with the restatement of our financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2013, management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, reassessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. Based on this reassessment using the guidelines established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 1992, management had concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 because of a material weakness related to the application of revenue accounting guidance to our smartphone revenues for sales through digital storefronts. This control deficiency resulted in the misstatement of our revenues and cost of revenues, including gross margin percentages, and the related balance sheet accounts and financial disclosures for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012 (and the restatement of unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, June 30, and September 30 for such years). Although we have remediated this material weakness, if we are otherwise unable to maintain adequate internal controls for financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls as required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, it could result in another material misstatement of our financial statements that would require a restatement, investor confidence in the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reports may be impacted or the market price of our common stock could be negatively impacted.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur business will suffer if our acquisition and strategic investment activities are unsuccessful or disrupt our ongoing business, which may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions.\nWe have acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, companies, products and technologies that complement our strategic direction. Acquisitions and investments involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues related to integration and administration;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully integrate the acquired technology and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures;\n\u00b7\nsignificant competition from other game companies as the gaming industry consolidates;\n\u00b7\nchallenges retaining the key employees, customers and other business partners of the acquired business;\n\u00b7\nour ability to realize synergies expected to result from an acquisition or strategic investment;\n\u00b7\nan impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets or investments in future periods would result in a charge to earnings in the period in which the write-down occurs;\n\u00b7\nthe internal control environment of an acquired entity may not be consistent with our standards and may require significant time and resources to improve;\n\u00b7\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and\n\u00b7\nliability for activities of the acquired companies before the acquisition, including violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities.\nIn addition, if we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition or strategic investment, as we did for our acquisitions of Griptonite, Inc., Blammo Games Inc., GameSpy Industries, Inc., PlayFirst, Inc. and Cie Games, Inc., our current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership and earnings per share would be diluted. Because acquisitions and strategic investments are inherently risky, our transactions may not be successful and may, in some cases, harm our operating results or financial condition.\nChanges in foreign exchange rates and limitations on the convertibility of foreign currencies could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe currently transact business in 100 countries and in dozens of different currencies, with Pounds Sterling, Euros and Chinese Renminbi being the primary international currencies in which we transact business. Conducting business in currencies other than U.S. Dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative impact on our reported operating results. We experienced significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates in 2013 and 2014, and expect to experience continued significant fluctuations in the future. We incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our non-U.S. locations in the local currency, and an increasing percentage of our international revenue is from customers who pay us in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and those other currencies could result in the U.S. Dollar equivalent of these expenses being higher and/or the U.S. Dollar equivalent of the foreign-denominated revenue being lower than would be the case if exchange rates were stable. This could negatively impact our operating results. Conversely, the current economic crisis in\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRussia has led to a significant devaluation of the Ruble compared to the U.S. Dollar, which has reduced the effective salaries of our employees in our Moscow studio. As a result, we may be at risk of losing key employees to competitors who are willing to offer higher effective wages. To date, we have not engaged in exchange rate hedging activities, and we do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.\nWe face additional risk if a currency is not freely or actively traded. Some currencies, such as the Chinese Renminbi in which our Chinese operations principally transact business, are subject to limitations on conversion into other currencies, which can limit our ability to react to rapid foreign currency devaluations and to repatriate funds to the United States should we require additional working capital.\nWe face added business, political, regulatory, operational, financial and economic risks as a result of our international operations and distribution, any of which could increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results.\nInternational sales represented approximately 40.6%, 53.9%, and 46.6% of our revenues in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. To target international markets, we develop games that are customized for consumers in those markets. We have international offices located in a number of foreign countries including Canada, China, India, Japan, Korea and Russia. We expect to maintain our international presence, and we expect international sales will continue to be an important component of our revenues, particularly in APAC markets. Risks affecting our international operations include:\n\u00b7\nour ability to develop games that appeal to the tastes and preferences of consumers in international markets;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;\n\u00b7\nmultiple and conflicting laws and regulations, including complications due to unexpected changes in these laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nour ability to develop, customize and localize games that appeal to the tastes and preferences of consumers in international markets;\n\u00b7\ncompetition from local game developers that have significant market share in certain foreign markets and a better understanding of local consumer preferences;\n\u00b7\npotential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting improper payments to government officials or representatives of commercial partners;\n\u00b7\nregulations that could potentially affect the content of our products and their distribution, particularly in China;\n\u00b7\nforeign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating income earned in countries outside the United States, particularly China;\n\u00b7\npotential adverse foreign tax consequences, since due to our international operations, we must pay income tax in numerous foreign jurisdictions with complex and evolving tax laws;\n\u00b7\npolitical, economic and social instability, including the ongoing hostilities in the Ukraine and the economic crisis in Russia, which could potentially negatively impact us given that we have a development studio in Moscow;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the export or import of technology;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\ntrade and tariff restrictions and variations in tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers; and\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights in certain countries.\nThese risks could harm our international operations, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In particular, we have approximately 130 employees located at our development studio in Moscow, Russia. The current economic crisis in Russia, including the destabilization of the Ruble, could lead to unstable political conditions, civil unrest or other developments that could materially affect our business, including through distractions and potential hardships to our Russian employees, restrictions on our ability to fund our Russian operations, and other difficulties that could cause delays to our game launches or even the cancellation of a game release and otherwise affect our ability to update and maintain games previously released from our Moscow studio.\nIf we fail to deliver our games at the same time as new mobile devices are commercially introduced, our revenues may suffer.\nOur business depends, in part, on the commercial introduction of new mobile devices with enhanced features, including larger, higher resolution color screens, improved audio quality, and greater processing power, memory, battery life and storage. For example, the introduction of new and more powerful versions of Apple\u2019s iPhone and iPad and devices based on Google\u2019s Android operating system, have helped drive the growth of the mobile games market. In addition, consumers generally purchase the majority of content, such as our games, for a new device within a few months of purchasing it. We do not control the timing of these device launches. Some manufacturers give us access to their mobile devices prior to commercial release. If one or more major manufacturers were to stop providing us access to new device models prior to commercial release, we might be unable to introduce games that are compatible with the new device when the device is first commercially released, and we might be unable to make compatible games for a substantial period following the device release. If we do not adequately build into our title plan the demand for games for a particular mobile device or experience game launch delays, we miss the opportunity to sell games when new mobile devices are shipped or our end users upgrade to a new mobile device, our revenues would likely decline and our business, operating results and financial condition would likely suffer.\nIf the use of smartphones and tablet devices as game platforms and the proliferation of mobile devices generally do not increase, our business could be adversely affected.\nWhile the number of people using mobile Internet-enabled devices, such as smartphones and tablet devices, has increased dramatically in the past few years, the mobile market, particularly the market for mobile games, is still emerging, and it may not grow as we anticipate. Our future success is substantially dependent upon the continued growth of use of mobile devices for games. The proliferation of mobile devices may not continue to develop at historical rates and consumers may not continue to use mobile Internet-enabled devices as a platform for games. In addition, new and emerging technologies could make the mobile devices on which our games are currently released obsolete, requiring us to transition our business model to develop games for other next-generation platforms.\nOur business is subject to increasing governmental regulation. If we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our business may suffer.\nWe are subject to a number of domestic and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. Not only are these laws constantly evolving, which could result in their being interpreted in ways that could harm our business, but legislation is also continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution. In the United States, for example, numerous federal and state laws have been introduced which attempt to restrict the content or distribution of games. Legislation has been adopted in several states, and proposed at the federal level, that prohibits the sale of certain games to minors. If such legislation is adopted, it could harm our business by limiting the games we are able to offer to our customers or by limiting the size of the potential market for our games. We may also be required to modify certain games or alter our marketing strategies to comply with new and possibly inconsistent regulations, which could be costly or delay the release of our games. For example, the United Kingdom\u2019s Office of Fair Trading issued new principles in January 2014 relating to in-app purchases in free-to-play games that are directed towards children 16 and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nunder, which principles became effective in April 2014. In addition, in response to a request made by the European Commission, Google has announced that it will no longer label free-to-play games as free in European Union countries. Similarly, in the fourth quarter of 2014, Apple changed its label for free-to-download applications from \u201cFREE\u201d to \u201cGET\u201d in the Apple App Store. The Federal Trade Commission has also indicated that it intends to review issues related to in-app purchases, particularly with respect to games that are marketed primarily to minors; the Federal Trade Commission recently reached settlement agreements with Apple and Google on this subject. If the Federal Trade Commission issues rules significantly restricting or even prohibiting in-app purchases, it would significantly impact our business strategy. In addition, two self-regulatory bodies in the United States (the Entertainment Software Rating Board) and in the European Union (Pan European Game Information (PEGI)) provide consumers with rating information on various products such as entertainment software similar to our products based on the content (for example, violence, sexually explicit content, language). Furthermore, the Chinese government has adopted measures designed to eliminate violent or obscene content in games. In response to these measures, some Chinese telecommunications operators have suspended billing their customers for certain mobile gaming platform services, including those services that do not contain offensive or unauthorized content, which could negatively impact our revenues in China. Any one or more of these factors could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers, by limiting the size of the potential market for our products, or by requiring costly additional differentiation between products for different territories to address varying regulations.\nFurthermore, the growth and development of free-to-play gaming and the sale of virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours. We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of our industry will increase and that we will be required to devote legal and other resources to addressing such regulation. For example, existing laws or new laws regarding the regulation of currency and banking institutions may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods. If that were to occur we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which may depend on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States or elsewhere regarding these activities may dampen the growth of free-to-play gaming and impair our business.\nWe sometimes offer our players various types of sweepstakes, giveaways and promotional opportunities, and recently launched a version of our Frontline Commando: D-Day game utilizing the Skillz technology platform that allows players to compete against each other in tournaments for cash prizes. We have also in the past through a partnership with Probability PLC offered a suite of Glu branded mobile slots games in the United Kingdom and might continue to explore opportunities with respect to real money gambling. We are subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and offering of such activities and games, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. Any court ruling or other governmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services could result in criminal or civil liability and could harm our business.\nIn addition, because our services are available worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions and others may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, including in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure.\nThe laws and regulations concerning data privacy and data security are continually evolving, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the protection of the information that we collect regarding our users, which laws are currently in a state of flux and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. The U.S. government, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, is continuing to review the need for greater regulation over collecting information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet and on mobile devices. For example, in December 2012, the Federal Trade Commission adopted amendments to the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act to strengthen privacy protections for children under age 13, which amendments became effective in July 2013. In addition, the European Union has proposed reforms to its existing data protection legal framework. Various government and consumer agencies have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices. For example,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nin February 2012, the California Attorney General announced a deal with Amazon, Apple, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and Research in Motion to strengthen privacy protection for users that download third-party apps to smartphones and tablet devices. Additionally, in January 2014, the Federal Trade Commission announced a settlement with Apple related to in-app purchases made by minors. In response to developments in the interpretation and understanding of regulations such as these and guidance and inquiries from the California Attorney General, we released updates to our My Dragon and Deer Hunter Reloaded games and made changes to our games in development to make our privacy policy readily accessible to players of these games as required by the California Online Privacy Protection Act. If we do not follow existing laws and regulations, as well as the rules of the smartphone platform operators, with respect to privacy-related matters, or if consumers raise any concerns about our privacy practices, even if unfounded, it could damage our reputation and operating results.\nAll of our games are subject to our privacy policy and our terms of service located on our corporate website. If we fail to comply with our posted privacy policy, terms of service or privacy-related laws and regulations, including with respect to the information we collect from users of our games, it could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. In addition, interpreting and applying data protection laws to the mobile gaming industry is often unclear. These laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country to country, or region to region, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, if we fail to adequately protect our users\u2019 privacy and data, it could result in a loss of player confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of users, which could adversely affect our business.\nIn the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California\u2019s Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement. Costs to comply with these laws may increase as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities. The security measures we have in place to protect our data and the personal information of our employees, customers and partners could be breached due to cyber-attacks initiated by third party hackers, employee error or malfeasance, or otherwise. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any breach or unauthorized access could materially interfere with our operations or our ability to offer our services or result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our data, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOur stock price has fluctuated and declined significantly since our initial public offering in March 2007, and may continue to fluctuate, may not rise and may decline further.\nThe trading price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is expected to continue to fluctuate in the future, as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control, such as changes in the operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular, such as Electronic Arts, King Digital Entertainment and Zynga. We also experience stock price volatility as investors monitor the performance of our games through third party tools, such as App Annie, the Apple App Store\u2019s \u201cTop Grossing\u201d rankings and other measurements of the performance of our games.\nIn addition, The NASDAQ Global Market on which our common stock is listed has recently and in the past experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many companies, some of which appear to be unrelated or disproportionate to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Securities class action litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and improperly use our intellectual property and our business and operating results may be harmed.\nOur intellectual property is essential to our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. To date, we have only one issued U.S. patent, and have filed only six patent applications and inherited an additional two patent applications through acquisitions, so we will not be able to protect the vast majority of our technologies from independent invention by third parties. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise to obtain and use our technology and games, and some parties have distributed \u201cjail broken\u201d versions of our games where all of the content has been unlocked and made available for free. Further, some of our competitors have released games that are nearly identical to successful games released by their competitors in an effort to confuse the market and divert users from the competitor\u2019s game to the copycat game. We believe that these tactics were employed by Hothead Games in their game Kill Shot, which we believe infringes certain Glu copyrights and trade dress contained in our Deer Hunter 2014 game. We have initiated litigation against Hothead Games related to their Kill Shot game, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention. To the extent competitors continue to copy our games, it could reduce our revenues that we generate from these games. Monitoring unauthorized use of our games is difficult and costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent piracy and other unauthorized distribution and use of our technology and games, particularly in certain international jurisdictions, such as China, where the laws may not protect our intellectual property rights as fully as in the United States. In the future, we may have to institute additional litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and our resources.\nIn addition, although we require our third-party developers to sign agreements not to disclose or improperly use our trade secrets, to acknowledge that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf are our property and to assign to us any ownership they may have in those works, it may still be possible for third parties to obtain and improperly use our intellectual properties without our consent. This could harm our brand, business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may become involved in intellectual property disputes, which may disrupt our business and require us to pay significant damage awards.\nThird parties may sue us for intellectual property infringement, or initiate proceedings to invalidate our intellectual property, which, if successful, could disrupt our business, cause us to pay significant damage awards or require us to pay licensing fees. For example, on August 20, 2014, Inventor Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that we were infringing one of its patents and seeking unspecified damages, including interest, costs, expenses and an accounting of all infringing acts, attorneys\u2019 fees and such other costs as the Court deems just and proper. In addition, in November 2014, Telinit Technologies, LLC, a Texas company, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division, alleging that we were infringing one of its patents and seeking unspecified damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. We settled the dispute with Telinit for an immaterial amount in January 2015. If there is a successful claim against us in the future, we might be enjoined from using our intellectual property or licensed intellectual property that we use in our business, we might incur significant licensing fees and we might be forced to develop alternative technologies. We may also be required to pay penalties, judgments, royalties or significant settlement costs. If we fail or are unable to develop non-infringing technology or games or to license the infringed or similar technology or games on a timely basis, we may be forced to withdraw games from the market or prevented from introducing new games. We might also incur substantial expenses in defending against third-party claims, regardless of their merit.\nIn addition, we use open source software in some of our games and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. We may face claims from companies that incorporate open source software into their products, claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, the open source software and/or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ndevelopment resources to change our games, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results.\nWe may become a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nWe may become subject to various legal proceedings, claims and regulatory inquiries that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims and inquiries may arise in the future. In addition, events may give occur that give rise to a potential risk of litigation. The number and significance of regulatory inquiries have increased as our business has evolved. Any proceedings, claims or inquiries initiated by or against us, whether successful or not, may be time consuming; result in costly litigation, damage awards, consent decrees, injunctive relief or increased costs of business, require us to change our business practices or products, require significant amounts of management time, result in diversion of significant operations resources or otherwise harm of business and future financial results.\n\u201cCheating\u201d programs, scam offers, black-markets and other offerings or actions by unrelated third parties that seek to exploit our games and players affect the game-playing experience and may lead players to stop playing our games or divert revenues to unrelated third parties.\nUnrelated third parties have developed, and may continue to develop, \u201ccheating\u201d programs, scam offers, black-markets and other offerings that may decrease our revenues generated from our virtual economies, divert our players from our games or otherwise harm us. Cheating programs enable players to exploit vulnerabilities in our games to obtain virtual currency or other items that would otherwise generate in-app purchases for us, play the games in automated ways or obtain unfair advantages over other players who do play fairly. Unrelated third parties attempt to scam our players with fake offers for virtual goods or other game benefits. We devote resources to discover and disable these programs and activities, but if we are unable to do so in a prompt and timely manner, our operations may be disrupted, our reputation damaged and players may play our games less frequently or stop playing our games altogether. This may lead to lost revenue from paying players, increased cost of developing technological measures to combat these programs and activities, legal claims relating to the diminution in value of our virtual currency and goods, and increased customer service costs needed to respond to disgruntled players.\nUnanticipated changes in our income tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities may affect our future financial results.\nOur future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Determining our worldwide provision for income taxes requires significant judgments. The estimation process and applicable laws are inherently uncertain, and our estimates are not binding on tax authorities. Our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Recent and contemplated changes to U.S. tax laws, including limitations on a taxpayer\u2019s ability to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and defer certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the U.S. are repatriated to the U.S., could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. Further, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including our transfer pricing, or determine that the manner in which we operate our business is not consistent with the manner in which we report our income to the jurisdictions, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine if our provision for income taxes is adequate. These continuous examinations may result in unforeseen tax-related liabilities, which may harm our future financial results.\nWe must charge, collect and/or pay taxes other than income taxes, such as payroll, value-added, sales and use, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdiction. If tax authorities assert that we have taxable nexus in a jurisdiction, they may seek to impose past as well as future tax liability and/or penalties. Any such impositions could also cause significant administrative burdens and decrease our future sales. Moreover, state and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nfederal legislatures have been considering various initiatives that could change our tax position regarding sales and use taxes.\nFinally, as we change our international operations, adopt new products and new distribution models, implement changes to our operating structure or undertake intercompany transactions in light of changing tax laws, our tax expense could increase.\nOur facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones, and the occurrence of an earthquake or other natural disaster could damage our facilities and equipment, which could require us to curtail or cease operations.\nOur principal offices are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, an area known for earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including power loss, fires, explosions, floods, communications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events. If any natural or other disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business could be impaired.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research about our business, or publish negative or misinformed reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline and/or become more volatile.\nThe trading market for our common stock is affected by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or lower their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. In addition, our share price and the volatility of our shares can be affected by misinformed or mistaken research reports on our business.\nOur common stock price may be affected by third-party data regarding our games.\nThird parties publish daily data about us and other mobile gaming companies with respect to downloads of our games, daily and monthly active users and estimated revenues generated by our games. These metrics can be volatile, particularly for specific games, and in many cases do not accurately reflect the actual levels of usage of our games across all platforms or the revenue generated by our games. To the extent that securities analysts or investors base their views of our business or prospects on such third-party data, the price of our common stock may be affected by such third party data and may not reflect the actual performance of our business.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales might occur, could reduce the price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock could decline as a result of substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors and their affiliates, executive officers, employees and significant stockholders, under our current shelf registration statements, through a large number of shares of our common stock becoming available for sale, or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares. For example, we issued 9,982,886 shares in connection with our acquisition of Cie Games, Inc. in August 2014. We filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 covering the resale of such shares. Accordingly, the shares issued in the Cie Games acquisition are subject to only limited re-sale restrictions and sales of substantial amounts of such shares may occur.\nSome provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, may deter third parties from seeking to acquire us.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nonly our chairman of the board, our lead independent director, our chief executive officer, our president or a majority of our board of directors is authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nour stockholders are able to take action only at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u00b7\nonly our board of directors and not our stockholders is able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nour certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval; and\n\u00b7\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before a meeting of stockholders.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents certain stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding common stock not held by such 15% or greater stockholder.", "PERMNO": 91900, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "GLUU"}
