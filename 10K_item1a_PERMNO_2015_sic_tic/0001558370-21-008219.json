{"cik": "927355", "company": "TESSCO TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-06-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe are not able to identify or control all circumstances that could occur in the future that may adversely affect our business and operating results. The following are certain risk factors that could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. These risk factors and others described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on, or that management currently deems immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. If our business, financial position and results of operations are adversely affected by any of these or other adverse events, our stock price would also likely be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe have incurred net losses in each of the past two fiscal years, and we may not be able to achieve profitability, or do so in a timely manner.\nWe incurred consolidated net losses of $8.7 million and $21.6 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively (losses of $14.3 million and $15.6 million, respectively, from continuing operations). During the past three years, we have taken steps to refresh our management team and board of directors, and we have made and expect to make significant investments in the replacement of our information technology platform. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. While we believe we are making progress to improve our operating profitability, there can be no assurances that we will achieve profitability or that profitability will be achieved in a timely manner.\nWe face risks related to adverse global or national economic conditions or events (including health epidemics and trade wars and other outbreaks and events beyond our control) that could significantly disrupt our business and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nOur business, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by weak or unstable global or national economic conditions, including international trade protection measures and disputes, such as those between the United States and China, and public health issues or events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic discussed below. A significant portion of our product offerings, including a majority of our private label Ventev products and products we acquire from our suppliers, are manufactured in foreign countries, including China and Vietnam, and many of the component parts of our products manufactured in Vietnam are sourced from China. Our ability to meet our customers' demands depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of inventory from our suppliers. Weak or unstable global or national economic conditions could harm our suppliers\u2019 businesses, contributing to product shortages or delays, supply chain disruptions, increased product costs and other adverse effects on their operations, which could hamper our ability or preclude us from obtaining timely and adequate delivery of inventory from our suppliers, as needed to support our business. In addition, many products produced for others in the industries we serve, and which our product offerings are intended to complement, are subject to many of the same risks and uncertainties as are ours, and perhaps others. If production or sales of those products are impacted by negative events, so will be the demand for our complementary products. Any of these events or occurrences could have a negative impact on our business, financial positions and results of operations.\nIn late December 2019, a strain of coronavirus, commonly referred to as COVID-19, surfaced in Wuhan, China. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared this coronavirus outbreak a health emergency of international concern. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, COVID-19 spread to the U.S. and resulted in most states imposing restrictions on travel, business operations and gatherings. As a result, many of our customers were temporarily closed or significantly scaled back their operations. Many non-essential projects were delayed, or project venues have been unreachable. While vaccines have been introduced and are continuing to be rolled out across the United States and elsewhere, our business and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected to the extent the coronavirus and its ongoing and lingering affects continue to harm the U.S. and world economy generally, or otherwise interfere with our supply chain or the manufacture of products that ours are intended to complement or otherwise\nrely upon. Because we source some of our products from foreign markets, we may be susceptible to the effects of continuing outbreaks or resurgences of coronavirus elsewhere, and any resulting disruption of our supply chain.\nWe may also experience negative effects from future health epidemics or outbreaks or other world events or disasters beyond our control. These events are impossible to forecast and difficult to mitigate. As a consequence, our operating results for a particular period may be more difficult to predict. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face significant competition in the wireless communications distribution industry.\nThe wireless communications distribution industry is competitive and fragmented, and is comprised of several national distributors, as well as numerous regional distributors. In addition, many manufacturers sell and fulfill directly to customers. Barriers to entry for distributors are relatively low and the risk of new competitors entering the market is high. Some of our current competitors have substantially greater capital resources and sales and distribution capabilities than we do. In response to competitive pressures from any of our current or future competitors, we may be required to lower selling prices in order to maintain or increase market share, and such measures could adversely affect our operating results. We are also seeing increased competition in the form of e-commerce sites as consumers and business are increasingly looking to the internet to purchase goods.\nWe offer no assurance that we will not lose market share, or that we will not be forced in the future to reduce our prices in response to the actions of our competitors, thereby reducing our gross margins. Furthermore, to remain competitive we may be forced to offer more credit or extended payment terms to our customers. This could increase our required capital, financing costs, and the amount of our bad debt expenses.\nWe typically purchase and sell our products on the basis of individual sales or purchase orders, and even in those cases where we have standing agreements or arrangements with our customers and suppliers, those agreements and arrangements typically contain no purchase or sale obligations and are otherwise terminable by either party upon several months or otherwise short notice.\nOur sales to customers and our purchases from suppliers are largely governed by individual sales or purchase orders, so there is no guarantee of future business. In some cases, we have formal agreements or arrangements with significant customers or suppliers, but they are largely administrative in nature and are terminable by either party upon several months or otherwise short notice, and they typically contain no purchase or sale obligations. Many of our customer and supplier contracts contain \u201cevergreen\u201d clauses, although this too is largely a matter of administrative convenience, because the contracts are nevertheless typically terminable on short notice, and because no purchase and sale obligation in any event arises other than pursuant to an accepted purchase order. When negotiating with customers and suppliers, we seek the most favorable terms available under the circumstances. Our preferred supplier terms include, among others, terms that provide for product warranty and return rights, as well as product liability and intellectual property indemnification rights, in each case consistent with our preferred business methods and objectives. We have not been able, nor do we expect in the future to be able to negotiate the inclusion of all our preferred terms, or our preferred language for those terms, in every contract. The degree of our success in this regard is largely a function of the parties\u2019 relative bargaining positions.\nWhen unable to negotiate the inclusion of our preferred terms or preferred language in a particular supplier contract, we assess any increased risk presented, as well as mitigating factors, analyze our overall business objectives, and then proceed accordingly. In some instances, we refuse the contract and seek other sources for the product, and in other instances business objectives and circumstances are determined to outweigh or mitigate any increased risk, or otherwise dictate that we proceed with the contract, notwithstanding. We consistently seek to manage contractual risks resulting from supplier contracts not including our preferred terms or language. However, these risks persist, and even when we are successful in negotiating our preferred terms, performance of these terms is not assured.\nIf our suppliers refuse to, or for any reason are unable to, supply products to us in sufficient quantities to meet demand, or at all, and if we are not able to procure those products from alternative sources, we may not be able to maintain appropriate inventory levels to meet customer demand and our financial position and results of operations would be\nadversely affected. Similarly, if customers decide to purchase from other sources, instead of from us, or experience significant changes in demand internally or from their own customer bases, become financially unstable (including on account of unforeseen events or events beyond their control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic), or are acquired by another company, our ability to generate revenues from these customers may, or in some cases would, be significantly affected, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe loss or any change in the business habits of key customers or suppliers may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nBecause our standing arrangements and agreements with our customers and suppliers typically contain no purchase or sale obligations and are terminable by either party upon several months or otherwise relatively short notice, we are subject to significant risks associated with the loss or change at any time in the business habits and financial condition of key customers or suppliers. We have experienced the loss and changes in the business habits of key customer and supplier relationships in the past and expect to do so again in the future. This is the nature of our business.\nSales of products purchased from our largest wireless infrastructure supplier generated approximately 29% of our revenues in fiscal year 2021, and sales of products purchased from our largest ten suppliers generated approximately 53% of fiscal year 2021 revenues. As is the case with many of our supplier and customer relationships, our contractual arrangements with these large suppliers are terminable by either party upon several months\u2019 notice. If these contracts or our relationships with these suppliers terminate for any reason, or if any of our other significant supplier relationships terminate for any reason, and we are not able to sell or procure a sufficient supply of those products from alternative sources, or at all, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected. Our suppliers are subject to many if not all of the same (or similar) risks and uncertainties to which we are subject, as well as other risks and uncertainties, and we compete with others for their business. Accordingly, we are at a continual risk of loss of their business on account of a number of factors and forces, many of which are largely beyond our control.\nIn fiscal year 2021, our largest customer accounted for 11% of our revenues. 26% of our sales in fiscal 2021 were made to five customers. Also, customer mix can change rapidly, and we may see changes in customer concentrations in the future. If or when any of our significant customer relationships terminate for any reason, and we are not able to replace those customers and associated revenues, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe loss of customer relationships and the corresponding reduction in the volume of product sales identified to those relationships, can also affect our negotiating ability with suppliers supplying those products. This can affect our margins on sales of those products to other customers. If we are unable to replace those products at favorable pricing and terms, or if we are unable to acquire those products from suppliers or offer those products to our customers on favorable terms, our competitiveness may suffer and result in reduced revenues and profits. Like our suppliers, our customers are subject to many if not all of the same (or similar) risks and uncertainties to which we are subject, as well as other risks and uncertainties, and we compete with others for their business. Accordingly, we are at continual risk of loss of their business on account of a number of factors and forces, many of which are largely beyond our control.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in replacing any of our past, present or future supplier or customer relationships if and when lost, or that we will not suffer a substantial reduction in revenues as a result of loss of any such relationship. As such, supplier, customer, or revenue loss would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nChanges in customer or product mix could cause our gross margin percentage to decline.\nWe continually experience changes in customer and product mix that affects gross margin. Changes in customer and product mix result primarily from changes in customer demand, customer acquisitions or losses, selling and marketing activities and competition.\nOur business depends on the continued tendency of wireless equipment manufacturers and network operators to outsource aspects of their business to us in the future.\nWe provide functions such as distribution, inventory management, fulfillment, e-commerce solutions, and other outsourced services for many wireless manufacturers and network operators. Certain wireless equipment manufacturers and network operators have elected, and others may elect, to undertake these services internally. Additionally, our customer service levels, industry consolidation, competition, deregulation, technological changes or other developments could reduce the degree to which members of the global wireless industry rely on outsourced logistic services such as the services we provide. Any significant change in the market for our outsourced services could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our outsourced services are generally provided under short-term contractual arrangements. The failure to obtain renewals or otherwise maintain these agreements on terms, including price, consistent with our current terms could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe require substantial capital to operate, and the inability to obtain financing on favorable terms will adversely impact our business, financial position and results of operations.\nOur business requires substantial capital to operate and to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that are not financed by trade creditors. We have historically relied upon cash generated from operations, revolving credit facilities and trade credit from our suppliers to satisfy our capital needs and finance growth. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on financial markets continues to evolve, and as this occurs and new regulations come into effect, and as the financial markets change on account of other forces and events, the cost of acquiring financing and the methods of financing may change. Changes in our credit rating or other market factors may increase our interest expense or other costs of capital, or capital may not be available to us on competitive terms to fund our working capital needs. Our existing secured revolving credit facility contains various financial and other covenants that may limit our ability to borrow or limit our flexibility in responding to business conditions. In addition, even if the terms of our revolving credit facility would otherwise allow or require, our lenders may refuse to lend to us through no fault of ours. The inability to maintain or when necessary obtain adequate sources of financing could have an adverse effect on our business. Our existing secured revolving credit facility includes variable rate debt, thus exposing us to risk of fluctuations in interest rates. Such fluctuations in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. We may in the future use interest rate swaps in an effort to achieve a desired proportion of fixed and variable rate debt. We would utilize these derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk, including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations. However, our use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to changes in interest rates.\nOur ability to maintain and borrow under our revolving credit agreement could be constrained by the level of eligible receivables and product inventory and by any failure to meet certain financial and other covenants in our revolving credit agreement.\nOur borrowing availability under our secured revolving credit facility is determined in part by a borrowing base and is limited to certain amounts of eligible accounts receivable and inventory. If the value of these accounts receivable and product inventory were to decrease significantly, the amount available for borrowing under the facility would decrease and our ability to borrow under the facility could be significantly impacted. Borrowing under the facility is also conditioned upon compliance with financial and other covenants included in the revolving credit agreement and a related guaranty and security agreement. Among these is a covenant to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio at any time during which the borrowing availability is otherwise less than $12.5 million. There are no assurances that we will be able to comply with all applicable covenants in these agreements, and in the event that we do not, our ability to borrow under our secured revolving credit facility could be limited or suspended or could terminate.\nIf we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under our secured revolving credit facility, our lenders could foreclose on, and acquire control of, a significant portion of our assets.\nIndebtedness under our secured revolving credit facility is secured by continuing first priority security interests in our inventory, accounts receivable, and deposit accounts, and on all documents, instruments, general intangibles, letter of credit rights, and chattel paper relating to inventory and accounts, and to all proceeds of the foregoing. If we fail to\nmeet our payment or other obligations under our secured revolving credit facility, our lenders could foreclose on these assets, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to successfully execute our merchandising and marketing strategic initiatives.\nWe are focusing our sales and marketing efforts and initiatives to maximize sales. If we fail to successfully execute these initiatives, our business, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe telecommunications products marketplace is dynamic and challenging because of the continued introduction of new products and services.\nWe must constantly introduce new products, services and product features to meet competitive pressures. We may be unable to timely change our existing merchandise sales mix in order to meet these competitive pressures, which may result in increased inventory costs, inventory write-offs or loss of market share.\nAdditionally, our inventory may also lose value due to price changes made by our significant suppliers, in cases where our arrangements with these suppliers do not provide for inventory price protection, or in cases where the supplier is unable or unwilling to provide these protections.\nConsolidation among wireless service carriers could result in the loss of significant customers.\nThe wireless service carrier industry has experienced significant consolidation in recent years. If any of our significant customers or partners are acquired or consolidate with other carriers, or are otherwise involved in any significant transaction that results in them ceasing to do business with us, or significantly reducing the level of business that they do with us, our revenues from those customers could be affected, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe failure of our information technology or telecommunication systems, or our inability to maintain or upgrade our information technology or telecommunication systems without incident or delay, or undue cost, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent upon our internal information technology and telecommunication systems, many of which are proprietary, to operate our business. These systems support all aspects of our business operations, including means of internal and external communication, inventory and order management, shipping, receiving and accounting. Most of our information technology systems contain a number of internally developed applications. In addition, all of these systems require continued maintenance and also require upgrading or replacement from time to time. There can be no assurance that these systems will not fail or experience disruptions, that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the operation of such systems, that we will be able to expand and improve our systems, that we will be able to convert to new systems efficiently as and when necessary, or that we will be able to integrate new programs effectively with our existing programs, in each case without incident or delay, or undue cost.\nComplications with the design or implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results. We are in the process of an implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system. This ERP system will replace our existing operating and financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company\u2019s financial records, enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to the Company\u2019s management team related to the operation of the business. The ERP system implementation process has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant personnel and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP system without experiencing delays, increased costs and other difficulties. If we are unable to successfully design and implement the new ERP system as planned, our financial positions, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or the\nERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed.\nWe, like most businesses, are subject to risk of cyber-attack and fraudulent and criminal activities of others and incur significant costs in efforts to defend these attacks and activities.\nWe like most businesses are continually subject to risk of cyber-attack and fraudulent and criminal activities of others, and are continually engaged in an effort to defend against and to ward off attacks from hackers and others. We have experienced cyber-attacks and suffered as a result of the fraudulent and criminal activities of others from time to time. Any of such problems or events, including any significant damage or destruction of our systems, including pursuant to or as a result of system security breaches, data protection breaches or other cyber-attacks, could result in significant disruption in our business and operations, harm our relationship with our customers or suppliers, and result in significant losses in revenues. Corrective action and compliance with applicable privacy and data protection laws could be costly. Any of these or similar events or occurrences could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. While we maintain insurance in an effort to manage some of these risks, insurance may not cover all losses and recovery is subject to applicable deductibles and other terms and limitations of the policies.\nWe depend heavily on e-commerce, and website security breaches or internet disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe rely on the internet (including Tessco.com\u00ae) for a significant percentage of our orders and information exchanges with our customers. The internet and individual websites have experienced a number of disruptions and slowdowns, some of which were caused by organized attacks. In addition, some websites have experienced security breakdowns. There can be no assurances that our website will not experience any material breakdowns, disruptions or breaches in security. If we were to experience a security breakdown, disruption or breach that compromised sensitive information, this could harm our relationship with our customers or suppliers. Disruption of our website or the internet in general could impair our order processing or more generally prevent our customers and suppliers from accessing information or placing orders. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nSystem security breaches or data protection breaches could adversely disrupt our business and harm our reputation, financial position and results of operations.\nWe manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business. In addition, we routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data, including sensitive and personally identifiable information, including customer credit card data and other information. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers or suppliers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. Such breaches, costs and consequences could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), a security standard applicable to companies that collect, store or transmit certain data regarding credit and debit cards, holders and transactions. From time to time we may not be fully or materially compliant with PCI DSS or other payment card operating rules. Any failure to comply fully or materially with the PCI DSS now or at any point in the future may violate payment card association operating rules and the terms of our contracts with payment processors and merchant banks, and could subject us to fines, penalties, damages and civil liability, and could result in the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments. Maintaining compliance with these regulations is costly and there is no guarantee that we will be successful or avoid fines, penalties, damages or civil liability, and even if successful, there is no guarantee that PCI DSS compliance\nwill prevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft, loss or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards, credit and debit card holders and credit and debit card transactions.\nThe inability to hire or retain certain key professionals, management and staff could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe nature of our business includes (but is not limited to) a high volume of transactions, business complexity, wide geographical coverage, and broad scope of products, suppliers, and customers. In order to compete, we must attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, sales, marketing and support positions. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, information technology and business generation personnel are critical to our business. Most of the members of our senior management team are parties to employment contracts or arrangements with us that provide for, among other things, various severance payments or benefits upon termination of their employment under certain circumstances, including termination by the Company without \u201ccause\u201d or for \u201cgood reason\u201d, and those contracts generally renew from year to year, except for the employment contract with Mr. Mukerjee, our CEO, which commenced in August 2019 and expires in March 2023. The loss of any of the members of our senior management team, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nTo attract, retain and motivate qualified employees, we rely heavily on stock-based incentive awards such as Performance Stock Units (PSUs) and stock options. If performance targets associated with PSUs are not met, or the value of such awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock and/or if our other stock-based compensation, such as stock options, otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain and motivate our employees could be adversely impacted, which could negatively affect our business, financial position and results of operations and/or require us to increase the amount we spend on cash and other forms of compensation. Our ability to issue PSUs, stock options and other equity instruments is also limited by the provisions of and our available shares under our current and/or future stock incentive plans, which may be subject to shareholder approval. We may currently issue awards under our incentive plan through June 4, 2029, and only insofar as shares are available for awards thereunder. As of May 25, 2021, the most recent date when PSUs and other equity instruments were issued, there were 303,279 shares available for future awards. Therefore, our ability to offer stock-based incentive awards may be limited, which may have an adverse effect on our continued ability to attract and retain, and motivate, our employees, and, subsequently, on our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, an increase in the number of shares for future awards, under either current or future compensation or incentive plans or arrangements could lead to dilution of our other stockholders.\nThe damage or destruction of any of our principal distribution or administrative facilities could materially adversely impact our business, financial position and results of operations.\nIf either of our distribution centers in Hunt Valley, Maryland or Reno, Nevada, were to be significantly damaged or destroyed, we could suffer a loss of product inventory and our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course could be materially and adversely affected. Similarly, if our office locations in Maryland, Nevada or Texas were to be significantly damaged or destroyed, our ability to conduct marketing, sales and other corporate activities in the ordinary course could be adversely affected.\nDisruption to our supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver inventory, resulting in a negative impact on our operating results.\nDue to several factors, including a raw materials shortage, global factory backlogs, transportation delays and customs delays caused in part due to the global economy recovering from the impact of COVID-19, our supply chain has been adversely impacted and lead times have increased considerably, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Future disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could also result from, among other factors, the following:\n\u2022Natural disaster;\n\u2022Pandemic outbreak of disease;\n\u2022Climate change and severity of extreme weather;\n\u2022Fire or explosion;\n\u2022Terrorism or other acts of violence;\n\u2022Labor strikes or other labor activities;\n\u2022Unavailability of raw or packaging materials;\n\u2022Operational and/or financial instability of key suppliers, and other vendors or service providers; and\n\u2022Suboptimal production planning which could impact our ability to cost-effectively meet product demand.\nWhile we believe that most competitors are experiencing similar supply chain delays, we also believe that we are taking adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of the current disruptions to the extent possible and reasonable. We have strategies and plans in place intended to manage disruptive events such as the current supply chain disruption and other disruptions, if and when they occur, including our global supply chain strategies. If we are unable, or find that it is not financially feasible, to effectively procure sufficient inventory on a timely basis to meet our customers\u2019 demands, due to the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our supply chain, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur.\nWe depend on third parties to manufacture products that we distribute and, accordingly, rely on their quality control procedures.\nProduct manufacturers typically provide limited warranties directly to the end consumer or to us, which we generally pass through to our customers. If a product we distribute for a manufacturer has quality or performance problems, our ability to provide products to our customers could be disrupted, which could adversely affect our operations.\nWe are subject to potential declines in inventory value.\nWe are subject to the risk that the value of our inventory will decline as a result of price reductions by suppliers or technological obsolescence or failure. It is the policy of many of our suppliers to protect distributors like us from the loss in value of inventory due to technological change or failure, or the suppliers\u2019 price reductions. Some suppliers (including those who manufacture our proprietary products), however, may be unwilling or unable to pay us for price protection claims or products returned to them under purchase agreements. No assurance can be given that such practices to protect distributors like us will continue, that unforeseen new product developments, product failure or product obsolescence will not adversely affect us, or that we will be able to successfully manage our existing and future inventories.\nOur future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of inventory to meet the demands of our customers.\nOur ability to meet our customers' demands depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of inventory from our suppliers. We have experienced shortages in the past that have negatively impacted our operations. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid these types of shortages, there can be no assurances that we will not encounter these problems in the future. Furthermore, certain of our products or components are available only from a single source or limited sources. We may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner. A reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies could have a negative impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nIf our business does not perform well, or if we otherwise experience a decline in the fair values of a portion or all of our business, we may be required to recognize impairments of our intangible or other long-lived assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nIndefinite lived intangible assets that are not amortized are initially recorded at fair value, and are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present.\nIn assessing the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margin, growth rates and discount rates based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and\nmanagement\u2019s judgment in applying these factors. As of March 28, 2021, we had $795,000 of indefinite lived intangible assets, which represented approximately 0.4% of total assets.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effect of the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. Factors in management\u2019s determination include the current tax laws, historical results, performance of the business, projections of future taxable income, and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. If based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income. Such charges could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur future results of operations may be impacted by prolonged weakness in the economic environment which may result in an impairment of the long-lived assets or the recording of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe primarily rely on trademark filings and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights.\nIn an effort to protect our intellectual property, including our product data, customer information and information technology systems, through trademark filings and nondisclosure, confidentiality and trade secret agreements, we typically require our employees, consultants and others having access to this information or our technology to execute confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. These agreements, however, may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information, and these agreements may be breached. A breach of confidentiality could adversely affect our business. In addition, in some situations, these agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants and others have previous employment or consulting relationships. Also, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. Adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. The disclosure of our proprietary information or trade secrets could impair our competitive position and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Others may obtain patent protection for technologies that are important to our business, and as a result, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. In response to patents of others, we may need to license the rights to use the technology patented by others, or in the event that a license cannot be obtained, design our systems around the patents of others. There can be no assurances as to our ability to obtain any such licenses or to design around the patents of others, and our inability to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe offer credit to our customers and, therefore, are subject to significant credit risk.\nWe sell our products to a large and diverse customer base. We finance a significant portion of such sales through trade credit, typically by providing 30-day payment terms. As a result, our business could be adversely affected in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition of our customers, resulting in the customers\u2019 inability to repay us. This risk may increase if there is a general economic downturn affecting a large number of our customers and in the event our customers do not adequately manage their business or properly disclose their financial condition. Also, several of our larger customers, including tier 1 public carrier customers, require greater than 30-day payment terms which could increase our credit risk and decrease our operating cash flow.\nWe may explore additional growth through acquisitions.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may continue to pursue the acquisition of companies that either complement or expand our existing business. As a result, we from time to time evaluate potential acquisition opportunities, which may be material in size and scope. In addition to those risks to which our business and the acquired businesses are generally subject to, the acquisition of these businesses gives rise to transactional and transitional risks, and the risk that the anticipated benefits will not be realized.\nRisks associated with the foreign suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. Since the onset of the weakness in the global economic environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our suppliers, particularly those in the far-east, have experienced financial difficulties and we believe it is possible that a limited number of suppliers may either cease operations or require increased prices in order to fulfill their obligations. Changes in our relationships with suppliers or increases in the costs of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could result in delays, inefficiencies or our inability to market products. In addition, our profit margins would decrease if prices of purchased raw materials, component parts, or finished goods increase and we are unable to pass on those increases to our customers. The adoption or expansion of trade restrictions or the occurrence of trade wars could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operation.\nWe rely on independent shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and to ship products to customers.\nWe rely on arrangements with independent shipping companies, for the delivery of our products from suppliers and to customers. The failure or inability of these shipping companies to deliver products, or the unavailability of their shipping services, even temporarily, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may also be adversely affected by an increase in freight surcharges due to rising fuel costs and added security. This could adversely impact our selling, general and administrative expenses or lead to price increases to our customers which could decrease customer demand for our products.\nChanges in income tax and other regulatory legislation.\nWe operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and make plans for our structure and operations based upon existing laws and anticipated future changes in the law. When new legislation is enacted with minimal advance notice, or when new interpretations or applications of existing laws are made, we may need to implement changes in our policies or structure. We are susceptible to unanticipated changes in legislation, especially relating to income and other taxes, import/export laws, hazardous materials and other laws related to trade, accounting and business activities. Such changes in legislation may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be subject to litigation.\nWe may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, antitrust, intellectual property and other issues. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or other adverse effects. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurred or future periods.\nWe may incur product liability claims which could be costly and could harm our reputation.\nThe sale of our products subjects us to the risk of product liability claims. We have also been increasing our focus on sales of our proprietary Ventev\u00ae products and on providing an increased level of support services, including product and network designs, which also subjects us to risk of product liability and performance claim risk. We seek to allocate product liability risk to our suppliers where available but may not be successful in doing so. We currently maintain product liability insurance, but our product liability insurance coverage is subject to various coverage exclusions and limits and may not be obtainable in the future on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We do not know whether claims against us with respect to our products and services, if any, would be successfully defended or whether we might be successful in allocating that risk to others, or whether our insurance would be sufficient to cover liabilities resulting from such claims. Any claims successfully brought against us could adversely affect our financial condition, and if substantial and relating to our products or industry generally, could adversely affect our business as a whole.\nOur expanding offering of private labeled products may have a negative impact on our relationship with our manufacturer partners.\nOur product offering includes a growing number of our own proprietary products, which represented approximately 8% of our sales in fiscal year 2021. Our proprietary products often compete with other manufacturers' branded items that we offer. A manufacturer may choose to not sell its products to us, or may substantially increase the price of products to us, in response to the competition created by the sales of our proprietary branded products. Either could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nA significant portion of our product offerings, including a majority of our Ventev\u00ae products and products we acquire from our suppliers, are manufactured in foreign countries, making the price and availability of these products susceptible to international trade risks and other international conditions.\nA significant portion of our products are manufactured in foreign countries, including China. The countries, specifically China, in which many of our products currently are manufactured or may be manufactured in the future are or could become subject to trade restrictions imposed by the U.S., including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes and customs restrictions, which would increase the cost or could reduce the supply of products available to us, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is also a concern that the imposition of additional tariffs by the United States could result in the adoption of tariffs by other countries as well. Such tariffs on imports from foreign countries, as well as changes in tax and trade policies, such as a border adjustment tax or disallowance of certain tax deductions for imported product, could materially increase our manufacturing costs, the costs of our imported products or our income tax expense, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Tariffs imposed by China or other foreign countries on imports of our products could also adversely affect our international e-commerce sales. Any increase in manufacturing costs, the cost of our products or limitation on the amount of products we are able to purchase, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Unless we are able to sufficiently mitigate their effects as applicable to us, the persistence or increase of tariffs, may adversely affect us or our business.\nLegislative or regulatory action could be taken that could limit our ability to use certain foreign suppliers to supply us with products.\nMembers of the U.S. Congress and certain regulatory agencies have raised concerns about American companies purchasing equipment and software from Chinese telecommunications companies, including concerns relating to alleged violations of intellectual property rights by Chinese companies and potential security risks posed by U.S. companies purchasing technical equipment and software from Chinese companies. In October 2012, the U.S. House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence issued a report asserting that network equipment manufactured by Chinese telecommunications companies poses a security threat to the United States and recommending the use of other network suppliers. The report also recommends that Congress consider adopting legislation to address these and other purported risks. Any such legislative or regulatory requirement that restricts us from purchasing or utilizing equipment or software from Chinese or other foreign companies with which we do or seek to do business, any determination by foreign companies upon which we rely to cease doing business in the United States, any determination by any of our suppliers or customers not to do business with us on account of actual or perceived business relationships that we may have with these suspect Chinese or other foreign companies, or any determination that we otherwise make that it is either necessary or advantageous for us to cease doing business with such foreign companies, could limit our product offerings, result in increased costs of goods and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nClaims that our products infringe the proprietary rights of others could harm our business and cause us to incur significant costs.\nOur industry has increasingly been subject to patent and other intellectual property rights litigation. We expect this trend to continue and accelerate and expect that we may be required to defend against this type of litigation, not only asserted against our own intellectual property rights, but also against the intellectual property of products which we have\npurchased for resale. Further, we may be obligated to indemnify and defend our customers if the products or services we supply to them are alleged to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. While we may be able to seek indemnification from our suppliers to protect our customers and us from such claims, there is no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating contractual terms with our suppliers to provide for such indemnification, or that we will otherwise be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that we will be protected from such claims. We may also be prohibited from marketing products, could be forced to market products without desirable features, or could incur substantial costs to defend legal actions, including where third parties claim that we or suppliers who may or may not have indemnified us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. In recent years, individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from target companies. Even if we believe that such infringement claims are without merit, the claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our business. Claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to enter into costly settlements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain products or services, which could affect our ability to compete effectively. If an infringement claim is successful, we may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Even if we have an agreement that indemnifies us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us.\nWe may be adversely affected by laws or regulations.\nWe are subject to various U.S. Federal, state and local, and non-U.S. laws and regulations. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations, or the application thereof. The introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the interpretations thereof, could increase the cost of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. For example, annual disclosure and reporting requirements relating to the SEC\u2019s conflict minerals rule require us to perform a reasonable country of origin inquiry and conduct further due diligence measures on our supply chain. There are costs and uncertainties associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals that we may find to be used in our products.\nRisks Related to our Exit from the Retail Business\nWe may not receive all of the potential payments to us under the terms of the Inventory Purchase Agreement applicable to our exit from the Retail business, or we may otherwise realize less net cash from the sale than expected.\nIn addition to amounts already paid to us, there are a number of payment obligations between the parties under the terms of the Inventory Purchase Agreement with Voice Comm for the sale of certain assets related to our Retail business. These include post-closing adjustments up to two years, potential payments to us in respect of certain future re-sales by Voice Comm of retail inventory purchased from us, potential royalty payments to us related to Voice Comm\u2019s sale of Ventev-branded mobile accessory products, and warranty and indemnity obligations. Voice Comm\u2019s business, on which its future payments to us are dependent, is subject to many of the same risks that we are subject to, and perhaps other risks. Accordingly, we may not receive all of the payments due to us under the terms of the Inventory Purchase Agreement or we may be required to make payments to Voice Comm in the form of adjustments or otherwise, and we may realize less overall net cash from the sale than we might otherwise anticipate. In addition, we have not transferred but have instead retained our receivables related to our historical Retail business, and those receivables remain subject to risks typically associated with receivables, including collection risks.\nThe Inventory Purchase Agreement with Voice Comm exposes us to contingent liabilities and other risks that could adversely affect our business or financial condition.\nPursuant to the Inventory Purchase Agreement, we have made customary representations and warranties and the parties have agreed to indemnify each other for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Inventory Purchase Agreement. The Inventory Purchase Agreement also subjects us to other risks typical in business transactions of this type, including payment and performance risks. The terms of the Inventory Purchase Agreement are complex and address all aspects of our former Retail business, including return of sold inventory, product warranty\nobligations, and customer and vendor relationships, among others. Should disputes arise or should we incur liability for breach of any of these representations, warranties or obligations, or should any of these other risks materialize, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, we have assigned or licensed Ventev\u00ae- related intellectual property to Voice Comm, including the Ventev\u00ae trademark for their use in connection with the sale of mobile device and accessory products, while we continue to use the brand and other Ventev\u00ae-related intellectual property in our ongoing and continuing business. This intellectual property sharing arrangement could result in identity confusion in the marketplace, and the actions or activities of one of Tessco or Voice Comm in respect of the shared intellectual property, whether positive or negative, may reflect on the other.\nOur long-term business prospects will depend on the success of our Commercial business.\nAs a result of our exit from the Retail business, our Commercial business is our sole remaining cash-generating business, and our overall business has become less diverse. Our long-term business prospects will, therefore, be dependent almost entirely on the success of our Commercial business and any other businesses that we pursue.\nThe Inventory Purchase Agreement with Voice Comm imposes non-compete obligations on us and our affiliates.\nUnder the terms of the Inventory Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed, on behalf of itself and its affiliates (including any owner of a majority of Tessco), not to compete with Voice Comm\u2019s retail business as operated by the Company at closing, for a period of five years after the closing date. Tessco will, however, retain the ability to continue to supply retail products to its commercial customers; and other exceptions to the non-compete obligation allow Tessco to divest itself of Retail inventory not acquired by Voice Comm. The overall non-compete obligation may, however, be terminated early by us upon the occurrence of certain change in control events and the payment to Voice Comm of certain agreed upon amounts (approximately $5,000,000, initially), which diminishes ratably over the five year non-compete period. This could make certain changes in control involving us more costly and therefore more difficult or less likely. Disagreements may arise between the parties as to the scope and meaning of the non-compete obligations and the various exceptions, which could be disruptive and subject us to claims for damages or specific performance of the non-compete obligations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nA significant portion of our voting stock is controlled by our executive officers, directors and beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock.\nOur executive officers, directors and beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially owned approximately 54% of our outstanding common stock as of March 28, 2021. Robert B. Barnhill, Jr., our Chairman of the Board, beneficially owned approximately 18% of our outstanding common stock as of March 28, 2021. These shareholders, and particularly if they decide to act together, have or would have the ability to significantly influence all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and any significant corporate transaction requiring shareholder approval.\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of any future activism activities by Robert B. Barnhill, Jr. and certain other participants in his consent solicitation and/or other activist investors.\nAs noted above, Mr. Robert B. Barnhill Jr. holds approximately 18% of our outstanding common stock. In September 2020, Mr. Barnhill and persons acting together with Mr. Barnhill initiated a consent solicitation to seek the consent of our stockholders holding at least a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock to, among other things, remove five members of our Board and replace them with four director candidates identified by Mr. Barnhill (the \u201cConsent Solicitation\u201d). Consents solicited during the Consent Solicitation were delivered to the Company on December 11, 2020.\nThe Consent Solicitation and the Company\u2019s response to it has resulted in, significant distraction for management and significant costs to the Company. Further, Consent Solicitations or other activities by Mr. Barnhill or by other activist shareholders could result in yet additional distractions and costs and could lead to a materially adverse impact on our business or operating results.\nOur quarterly financial results may fluctuate, which could lead to volatility in our stock price.\nOur revenue and operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to do so in the future. As a result, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance. Fluctuations in our revenue and operating results could negatively affect the trading price of our stock. Most of our operating expenses, such as compensation expenses, do not vary directly with the amount of sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term. As a result, if sales in a particular quarter are below expectations for that quarter, we may not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter, and therefore such a sales shortfall would have a disproportionate effect on our net income for the quarter. Therefore, our revenue and results of operations may, in the future, be below the expectations of analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline. Factors that are likely to cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate include the risk factors discussed throughout this section.\nWithout approval of our Board of Directors, it may be difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Company. This could affect the price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, including advance notice bylaws, and applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) may each make it more difficult for or may prevent a third party from acquiring control of us or changing our Board of Directors and management. We are afforded the protections of Section 203 of the DGCL, which will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15% of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock, unless Board of Director or shareholder approval were obtained. Some believe that the provisions described above, as well as any resulting delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our Board of Directors or management, could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our shareholders could receive a substantial premium over the then current market price for their shares. We, on the other hand, believe that these provisions serve to protect our shareholders against abusive takeover tactics, to preserve and maximize the value of the Company for all shareholders, and to better ensure that each shareholder will be treated fairly in the event of an unsolicited offer to acquire the Company.\nPotential uncertainty resulting from unsolicited acquisition proposals and related matters may adversely affect our business.\nIn the past we have received, and in the future, we may receive, unsolicited proposals to acquire our company or our assets. For example, in September 2010, the Board of Directors received an unsolicited non-binding proposal for the acquisition of all of our stock. The review and consideration of acquisition proposals and related matters could require the expenditure of significant management time and personnel resources. Such proposals may also create uncertainty for our employees, customers and suppliers. Any such uncertainty could make it more difficult for us to retain key employees and hire new talent, and could cause our customers and suppliers to not enter into new arrangements with us or to terminate existing arrangements. Additionally, we and members of our Board of Directors could be subject to future lawsuits related to unsolicited proposals to acquire us. Any such future lawsuits could become time consuming and expensive.", "PERMNO": 80951, "SIC": 5065, "TIC": "TESS"}
