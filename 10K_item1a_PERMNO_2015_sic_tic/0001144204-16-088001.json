{"cik": "1047170", "company": "EASTERN VIRGINIA BANKSHARES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves significant risks inherent to the Company\u2019s business. Like other bank holding companies, we are subject to a number of risks, many of which are outside of our control. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed. These risks are not the only ones that we may face. Other risks of which we are not aware, including those which relate to the banking and financial services industry in general and us in particular, or those which we do not currently believe are material, may harm our future business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Readers should consider carefully the following important risks, in conjunction with the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, in evaluating us, our business and an investment in our securities.\nDeterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect us.\nDeterioration in economic and market conditions, such as the economic downturn and recession that resulted from the financial crisis of 2008, could hurt our business and our financial condition and results of operations. Our business is directly affected by general economic and market conditions, broad trends in industry and finance, and inflation, all of which are beyond our control. A deterioration in economic conditions, and in particular an economic slowdown within our markets, could result in increases in loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures, and could result in decreases in demand for our products and services, and values of collateral supporting our loans. Declines in the housing market, including as experienced through falling home prices and rising foreclosures, can negatively impact the credit performance of real estate related loans. Declines in the employment markets, including as experienced through high unemployment and underemployment, can negatively impact the credit performance of consumer loans. Any of the foregoing effects could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a mixed market environment with influences from both rural and urban areas, and we will be affected by economic conditions in our Northern Neck, Middle Peninsula, Capital, Tidewater and Southern market areas. Changes in the local economy may influence the growth rate of our loans and deposits, the quality of the loan portfolio, and loan and deposit pricing. Although we might not have significant credit exposure to all the businesses in our market areas, a downturn in any business sector of a market area or a downturn with respect to any significant business in a market area could have a negative impact on local economic conditions and real estate collateral values in that market area, which could negatively affect our profitability.\nOfferings of our securities and other potential capital strategies or the conversion of shares of our non-voting mandatorily convertible non-cumulative preferred stock, Series B (the \u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d) into common stock could dilute your investment or otherwise affect your rights as a shareholder.\nIn the future we may seek to raise additional capital through offerings of our common stock, preferred stock, securities convertible into common stock, or rights to acquire such securities or our common stock. Under our Articles of Incorporation, we have additional authorized shares of common stock that we can issue from time to time at the discretion of our Board of Directors, without further action by shareholders, except where shareholder approval is required by applicable law or listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The issuance of any additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock in a subsequent offering could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock. Holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights as a matter of law that entitle them to purchase their pro-rata share of any offering or shares of any class or series. In addition, under our Articles of Incorporation, we can authorize and issue additional shares of our preferred stock, in one or more series the terms of which would be determined by our Board of Directors without shareholder approval, unless such approval is required by applicable law or listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of future sales of our securities or the perception that such sales could occur.\nNew investors, particularly with respect to newly authorized series of preferred stock, also may have rights, preferences, and privileges that are senior to, and that could adversely affect, our then current shareholders, and particularly holders of our common stock. For example, a new series of preferred stock could rank senior to shares of our common stock. As a result, we could be required to make any dividend payments on such preferred stock before any dividends can be paid on our common stock, and in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution, or liquidation, we may have to pay the holders of this new series of preferred stock in full prior to any distributions being made to the holders of our common stock.\nIn addition, the conversion of shares of our Series B Preferred Stock into common stock would dilute the voting power of our then-outstanding shares of common stock.\nWe cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of our future securities offerings or other capital initiatives or whether, when or how many shares of our Series B Preferred Stock will be converted into shares of common stock. Thus, our shareholders bear the risk of our future offerings or future conversions of shares of our Series B Preferred Stock diluting their stock holdings, adversely affecting their rights as shareholders, and/or reducing the market price of our common stock.\nAffiliates of Castle Creek Capital Partners (\u201cCastle Creek\u201d) and GCP Capital Partners (\u201cGCP Capital\u201d) are substantial holders of our common stock.\nCastle Creek holds approximately 8.1% of our common stock and approximately 28.0% of our combined common stock and Series B Preferred Stock. GCP Capital holds approximately 8.6% of our common stock and approximately 12.7% of our combined common stock and Series B Preferred Stock. Pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreements entered into with Castle Creek and GCP Capital, Castle Creek and GCP Capital each have a right to appoint a representative on our Board of Directors and on the Bank\u2019s board of directors. Boris M. Gutin serves on the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank at the request of an affiliate of GCP Capital. Castle Creek and GCP Capital may have individual economic interests that are different from the other\u2019s interests and different from the interests of our other shareholders.\nCompliance with laws, regulations and supervisory guidance, both new and existing, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous laws, regulations and supervision from both federal and state agencies. During the past few years, there has been an increase in legislation related to and regulation of the financial services industry. We expect this increased level of oversight to continue. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in financial, structural and operational penalties, including receivership. In addition, establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations may increase our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.\nLaws and regulations, and any interpretations and applications with respect thereto, generally are intended to benefit consumers, borrowers and depositors, not shareholders. The legislative and regulatory environment is beyond our control, may change rapidly and unpredictably and may negatively influence our revenue, costs, earnings, and capital levels. Our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new laws and regulations.\nFailure to comply with regulatory requirements could subject us to regulatory action.\nThe Company and the Bank are supervised by the Federal Reserve Board and the Bureau. As such, each is subject to extensive supervision and prudential regulation. Both the Company and the Bank must maintain certain risk-based and leverage capital ratios and operate in a safe and sound manner as required by the Federal Reserve and the Bureau. If the Company or the Bank fails to meet regulatory capital requirements or is deemed to be operating in an unsafe and unsound manner or in violation of law, it may be subject to a variety of informal or formal regulatory actions. Informal regulatory actions may include a memorandum of understanding which is initiated by the regulator and outlines an institution\u2019s agreement to take specified actions within specified time periods to correct violations of law or unsafe and unsound practices. In addition, as part of the regular examination process, regulators may advise the Company or the Bank to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter. Any of these restrictions, in whatever manner imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to informal regulatory actions, we may also be subject to formal regulatory actions. Failure to comply with an informal regulatory action could lead to formal regulatory actions. Formal regulatory actions include written agreements, cease and desist orders, the imposition of substantial fines and other penalties. Furthermore, if the Bank became severely undercapitalized, it could become subject to the prompt corrective action framework which imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital. A failure to meet regulatory capital requirements could also subject the Company to capital raising requirements. Additional capital raisings would be dilutive to holders of our common stock.\nAny remedial measure or regulatory action, whether formal or informal, could impose restrictions on our ability to operate our businesses and adversely affect our prospects, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, any formal enforcement action could harm our reputation and our ability to retain and attract customers, and impact the trading price of our common stock.\nOur regulatory compliance burden and associated costs could continue to increase, which could place restrictions on certain products and services, and limit our future capital strategies.\nA wide range of regulatory initiatives directed at the financial services industry have been proposed in recent years. One of those initiatives, the Dodd-Frank Act, represents a sweeping overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States and mandates significant changes in the financial regulatory landscape that has impacted and will continue to impact all financial institutions, including the Company and the Bank. The federal regulatory agencies, and particularly bank regulatory agencies, are given significant discretion in drafting the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s implementing rules and regulations, and certain of the implementing rules and regulations have not yet been proposed or approved; consequently the full details and impact of the Dodd-Frank Act will depend on the final implementing rules and regulations. Accordingly, it remains too early to fully assess the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and subsequent regulatory rulemaking processes on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act creates a new financial consumer protection agency, the CFPB, that can impose new regulations on us and include its examiners in our routine regulatory examinations conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (the \u201cReserve Bank\u201d), which could increase our regulatory compliance burden and costs and restrict the financial products and services we can offer to our customers. The CFPB, through the agency\u2019s rulemaking and enforcement authority with respect to the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s prohibitions against unfair, deceptive and abusive business practices, may reshape the consumer financial protection laws and directly impact the business operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services, including the Company and the Bank. This agency\u2019s broad rulemaking authority includes identifying practices or acts that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any consumer financial transaction or consumer financial product or service. The costs and limitations related to this additional regulatory agency and the limitations and restrictions that will be placed upon the Company with respect to its consumer product and service offerings have yet to be determined. However, these costs, limitations and restrictions may produce significant, material effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules require higher levels of capital and liquid assets, which could adversely affect our net income and return on equity.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules, which began to apply to the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015, represent the most comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. banking capital framework in over two decades. These rules require bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, such as the Company and the Bank, to dedicate more resources to capital planning and regulatory compliance, and maintain substantially more capital as a result of higher required capital levels and more demanding regulatory capital risk-weightings and calculations. The rules also require all banks to substantially change the manner in which they collect and report information to calculate risk-weighted assets, and likely increase risk-weighted assets at many banking organizations as a result of applying higher risk-weightings to certain types of loans and securities. As a result, we may be forced to limit originations of certain types of commercial and mortgage loans, thereby reducing the amount of credit available to borrowers and limiting opportunities to earn interest income from the loan portfolio, or change the way we manage past-due exposures.\nDue to the changes to bank capital levels and the calculation of risk-weighted assets, many banks could be required to access the capital markets on short notice and in relatively weak economic conditions, which could result in banks raising capital that significantly dilutes existing shareholders. Additionally, many community banks could be forced to limit banking operations and activities, and growth of loan portfolios and interest income, in order to focus on retention of earnings to improve capital levels. If the Basel III Capital Rules require the Company to access the capital markets in this manner, or similarly limit the Bank\u2019s operations and activities, the Basel III Capital Rules would have a detrimental effect on our net income and return on equity and limit the products and services we provide to our customers.\nWe have a high concentration of loans secured by both residential and commercial real estate and a further downturn in either or both real estate markets, for any reason, may increase our credit losses, which would negatively affect our financial results.\nWe offer a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer and other loans. Most of our loans are secured by real estate (both residential and commercial) in our market areas. At December 31, 2015, approximately 85.0% of our $880.8 million loan portfolio was secured by residential and commercial real estate. Changes in the real estate market, such as a deterioration in market value of collateral, or a decline in local employment rates or economic conditions, could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to pay these loans, which in turn could impact our profitability. Repayment of our commercial loans is often dependent on the cash flow of the borrower, which may be unpredictable. If the value of real estate serving as collateral for the loan portfolio materially declines, a significant portion of the loan portfolio could become under-collateralized. If the loans that are secured by real estate become troubled when real estate market conditions are declining or have declined, in the event of foreclosure we may not be able to realize the amount of collateral that was anticipated at the time of originating the loan. In that event, we may have to increase the provision for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur small to medium-sized business target market may have fewer financial resources to weather a downturn in the economy.\nWe target our commercial development and marketing strategy primarily to serve the banking and financial services needs of small and medium-sized businesses. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively impact this major economic sector in the markets in which we operate, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe have a concentration of credit exposure in acquisition and development (or \u201cADC\u201d) real estate loans.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had approximately $66.4 million in loans for the acquisition and development of real estate and for construction of improvements to real estate, representing approximately 7.5% of our total loans outstanding as of that date. These loans are to developers, builders and individuals. Project types financed include acquisition and development of residential subdivisions and commercial developments, builder lines for one to four family home construction and loans to individuals for primary and secondary residence construction. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans. Completion of development projects and sale of developed properties may be affected significantly by general economic conditions, and further downturn in the local economy or in occupancy rates in the local economy where the property is located could increase the likelihood of default. Because our loan portfolio contains acquisition and development loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in our percentage of non-performing loans. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital that may not be available to us.\nWe may need to or may otherwise be required to raise additional capital in the future, including if we incur losses or due to regulatory mandates. The ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend in part on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, additional capital may not be raised, if and when needed, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to maintain our capital ratios could be materially impaired, and we could face additional regulatory challenges.\nIf our allowance for loan losses becomes inadequate, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nMaking loans is an essential element of our business. The risk of nonpayment is affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to: the duration of the credit; credit risks of a particular customer; changes in economic and industry conditions; and, in the case of a collateralized loan, risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral. We cannot be sure that we will be able to identify deteriorating loans before they become nonperforming assets, or that we will be able to limit losses on those loans that are identified. Our allowance for loan losses is determined by analyzing historical loan losses, current trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, current economic conditions that may affect a borrower\u2019s ability to repay and the value of collateral, changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio and industry information. Also included in our estimates for loan losses are considerations with respect to the impact of economic events, the outcome of which are uncertain. Because any estimate of loan losses is necessarily subjective and the accuracy of any estimate depends on the outcome of future events, we face the risk that charge-offs in future periods will exceed our allowance for loan losses and that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses will be required. Additions to the allowance for loan losses would result in a decrease of our net income. We cannot be certain that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in our loan portfolio.\nWe may incur losses if we are unable to successfully manage interest rate risk.\nOur profitability depends in substantial part upon the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans and interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. These rates are normally in line with general market rates and rise and fall based on the asset liability committee\u2019s view of our financing and liquidity needs. We may selectively pay above-market rates to attract deposits, as we have done in some of our marketing promotions in the past. Changes in interest rates will affect our operating performance and financial condition in diverse ways including the pricing of securities, loans and deposits, which, in turn, may affect the growth in loan and retail deposit volume. Our net interest income will be adversely affected if market interest rates change so that the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest we earn on loans and investments. Our net interest spread will depend on many factors that are partly or entirely outside our control, including competition, federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies, and economic conditions generally. Fluctuations in market rates are neither predictable nor controllable and may have a material and negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the value of our loans. An increase in interest rates could adversely affect our borrowers\u2019 ability to pay the principal or interest on existing loans or reduce their desire to borrow more money. This may lead to an increase in nonperforming assets or a decrease in loan originations, either of which could have a material and negative effect on our results of operations.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry.\nWe face vigorous competition from other banks and other financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, savings banks, finance companies and credit unions for deposits, loans and other financial services in our market area. A number of these banks and other financial institutions are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater access to capital and other resources, as well as larger lending limits and branch systems, and offer a wider array of banking services. To a limited extent, we also compete with other providers of financial services, such as money market mutual funds, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and governmental organizations which may offer more favorable financing than we can. Many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern us. As a result, these non-bank competitors have advantages over us in providing certain services. We may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of our smaller size, smaller asset base, lack of geographic diversification and inability to spread our marketing costs across a broader market. If we have to raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on loans to compete effectively, our net interest margin and income could be negatively affected. Failure to compete effectively to attract new or to retain existing, clients may reduce or limit our margins and our market share and may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and growth.\nWe face risks in connection with our strategic and other business initiatives and we may not be able to fully execute on these initiatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nFrom time to time we may pursue, develop, and implement strategic business initiatives, which may include acquisitions, investments, asset purchases or other business growth initiatives or undertakings. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify appropriate opportunities, that we will be able to negotiate or finance such opportunities or that such opportunities, if pursued, will be successful.\nWe remain focused on building a robust banking franchise and continue to evaluate and undertake various strategic activities and business initiatives. These initiatives may include strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures, or partnerships, and may involve banking activities, products or services that are new to us. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify appropriate initiatives, that we will be able to negotiate or finance such initiatives or that such initiatives, if undertaken, will be successful.\nOur ability to execute strategic and other business initiatives successfully will depend on a variety of factors. These factors likely will vary based on the nature of the initiative but may include: overall market conditions, meeting applicable regulatory requirements and receiving approval of any regulatory applications or filings, hiring or retaining key employees, achieving anticipated business results, our success in operating effectively with any co-investor or partner with whom we elect to do business, our success in integrating any company that we choose to acquire, and achieving anticipated synergies of any acquisition, investment, joint venture or partnership. Our ability to address these factors successfully cannot be assured. In addition, our strategic efforts may divert resources or management's attention from ongoing business operations and may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and potential liability. If we do not successfully execute a strategic initiative, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation or growth prospects. In connection with executing any such initiative, we would expect to incur additional non-interest expense, and perhaps the initiative\u2019s entire cost, in advance of realizing improved financial condition and results of operations as a result of the initiative.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage our long-term growth, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA key aspect of our long-term business strategy is our continued growth and expansion. Our ability to continue to grow depends, in part, upon our ability to:\n\u00b7 open new branch offices or acquire existing branches or other financial institutions;\n\u00b7 attract deposits to those locations; and\n\u00b7 identify attractive loan and investment opportunities.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy if we are unable to identify attractive markets, locations or opportunities to expand in the future, or if we are subject to regulatory restrictions on growth or expansion of our operations. Our ability to manage our growth successfully also will depend on whether we can maintain capital levels adequate to support our growth, maintain cost controls and asset quality and successfully integrate any businesses we acquire into our organization. As we identify opportunities to implement our growth strategy by opening new branches or acquiring branches or other banks, we may incur increased personnel, occupancy and other operating expenses. In the case of new branches, we must absorb those higher expenses while we begin to generate new deposits, and there is a further time lag involved in redeploying new deposits into attractively priced loans and other higher yielding earning assets. Thus, any plans for branch expansion could decrease our earnings in the short run, even if we efficiently execute our branching strategy.\nDeterioration in the soundness of our counterparties could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could create another market-wide liquidity crisis similar to that experienced in late 2008 and early 2009 and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. There is no assurance that the failure of our counterparties would not materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nCyber-attacks or other security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs a financial institution, our operations rely heavily on the secure data processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Any failure, interruption or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our online banking system, customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit and loan servicing and other systems. The security and integrity of our systems and the technology we use could be threatened by a variety of interruptions or information security breaches, including those caused by computer hacking, cyber-attacks, electronic fraudulent activity or attempted theft of financial assets. We may fail to promptly identify or adequately address any such failures, interruptions or security breaches if they do occur. While we have certain protective policies and procedures in place, the nature and sophistication of the threats continue to evolve. We may be required to expend significant additional resources in the future to modify and enhance our protective measures.\nThe nature of our business may make it an attractive target and potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or similar disruptions. The technology-based platform we use processes sensitive data from our borrowers and investors. While we have taken steps to protect confidential information that we have access to, our security measures and the security measures employed by the owners of the technology in the platform that we use could be breached. Any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to our systems could cause confidential customer, borrower and investor information to be stolen and used for criminal purposes. Security breaches or unauthorized access to confidential information could also expose us to liability related to the loss of the information, time-consuming and expensive litigation and negative publicity. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in the technology-based platform that we use are exposed and exploited, our relationships with borrowers and investors could be severely damaged, and we could incur significant liability.\nBecause techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we and our collaborators may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, federal regulators and many federal and state laws and regulations require companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach are costly to implement and often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause customers, borrowers and investors to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures. Any security breach, whether actual or perceived, would harm our reputation and could cause us to lose customers, borrowers, investors and partners and adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe rely heavily on our management team and the unexpected loss of any of those personnel could adversely affect our operations; we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nWe are a customer-focused and relationship-driven organization. We expect our future growth to be driven in a large part by the relationships maintained with our customers by our president and chief executive officer and other senior officers. We have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer. The existence of such agreements, however, does not necessarily assure that we will be able to continue to retain their services. The unexpected loss of any of our key employees could have an adverse effect on our business and possibly result in reduced revenues and earnings. The implementation of our business strategy will also require us to continue to attract, hire, motivate and retain skilled personnel to develop new customer relationships as well as new financial products and services. Many experienced banking professionals employed by our competitors are covered by agreements not to compete or solicit their existing customers if they were to leave their current employment. These agreements make the recruitment of these professionals more difficult. The market for these people is competitive, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting, hiring, motivating or retaining them.\nOur deposit insurance premiums could increase in the future, which may adversely affect our future financial performance.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC insured financial institutions, including the Bank. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the DIF at a certain level. The financial crisis of 2008 and the resulting recession increased the rate of bank failures and expectations for further bank failures, requiring the FDIC to make payments for insured deposits from the DIF - which depleted the DIF - and prepare for future payments from the DIF.\nOn April 1, 2011, final rules to implement changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to the FDIC assessment rules became effective. The rules provide that a depository institution\u2019s deposit insurance assessment will be calculated based on the institution\u2019s total assets less tangible equity, rather than the previous base of total deposits. These changes have not materially increased the Company\u2019s FDIC insurance assessments for comparable asset and deposit levels. However, if the Bank\u2019s asset size increases or the FDIC takes other actions to replenish the DIF, the Bank\u2019s FDIC insurance premiums could increase.\nIt may be difficult to fully integrate the business of VCB and we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of VCB.\nIf our costs to fully integrate the business of VCB into our existing operations are greater than anticipated, or we are not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including cost savings and other synergies, our business could be negatively affected. In addition, it is possible that we could lose key employees from VCB\u2019s legacy operations, and that fully integrating VCB\u2019s legacy operations could result in loss of customers, the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Integration efforts also may divert management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our ability to service our existing business and generate new business, which in turn could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nCertain losses or other tax assets could be limited if we experience an ownership change, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards, built-in losses and certain other tax assets may be limited in the event of an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5% shareholders\u201d (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. If an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs, Section 382 would impose an annual limit on the amount of losses or other tax assets we can use to reduce our taxable income equal to the product of the total value of our outstanding equity immediately prior to the \u201cownership change\u201d and the applicable federal long-term tax-exempt interest rate. A number of special rules apply to calculating this limit. While stock issuances that we have completed since 2013 and other changes in ownership of certain of our shareholders may have increased the likelihood of an \u201cownership change,\u201d we currently believe that an \u201cownership change\u201d has not occurred. If such an ownership change has occurred or occurs in the future, we may not be able to use all of our net operating losses and other tax assets to offset taxable income, thus paying higher income taxes which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by the our in reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or omission. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individual acts, by collusion by two or more people and/or by override of the established controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control systems and in human nature, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nOur operations rely on certain external vendors.\nWe are reliant upon certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. Accordingly, our operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements. We maintain a system of comprehensive policies and a control framework designed to monitor vendor risks including, among other things, (i) changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure, (ii) changes in the vendor\u2019s financial condition, (iii) changes in the vendor\u2019s support for existing products and services and (iv) changes in the vendor\u2019s strategic focus. While we believe these policies and procedures help to mitigate risk, the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur communication and information systems may experience an interruption in service.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, transaction processing systems and various accounting and data management systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent and/or limit the effect of any failure or interruption of our communication and information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures or interruptions will not occur, or, if they do occur, they will be adequately addressed on a timely basis. The occurrence of failures or interruptions of our communication and information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe continually encounter technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Although recently we have significantly increased our focus on technological innovation and have introduced new, more technologically-advanced products and services, we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards and management\u2019s selection of accounting methods, including assumptions and estimates, could materially impact our financial statements.\nFrom time to time the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results, or a cumulative charge to retained earnings. In addition, management is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. If the assumptions or estimates are incorrect, the Company may experience unexpected material consequences.\nLiquidity needs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on dividends from the Bank as its primary source of additional liquidity, and the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company is restricted by applicable state and federal law. The primary sources of funds of the Bank are client deposits and loan repayments. While scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, they are subject to the ability of borrowers to repay the loans. The ability of borrowers to repay loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups, reductions in real estate values or markets, business closings or lay-offs, inclement weather, natural disasters and international instability. Additionally, deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, regulatory capital requirements, returns available to clients on alternative investments and general economic conditions. Accordingly, we may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such sources include FHLB advances, sales of securities and loans, and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks, as well as out-of-market time deposits. While we believe that these sources are currently adequate, there can be no assurance they will be sufficient to meet future liquidity demands.\nWe may be parties to certain legal proceedings that may impact our earnings.\nWe face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial impact or cause significant reputational risk to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.\nWe have goodwill that may become impaired, and thus result in a charge against earnings.\nThe Company is no longer required to perform a test for impairment unless, based on an assessment of qualitative factors related to goodwill, it determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount. If the likelihood of impairment is more than 50 percent, the Company must perform a test for impairment and we may be required to record impairment charges. In assessing the recoverability of the Company\u2019s goodwill, the Company must make assumptions in order to determine the fair value of the respective assets. Major assumptions used in the impairment analysis are discounted cash flows, merger and acquisition transaction values (including as compared to tangible book value), and stock market capitalization. The Company has elected to bypass the preliminary assessment and conduct a full goodwill impairment analysis on an annual basis through the use of an independent third party specialist. As of December 31, 2015, we had $17.1 million of goodwill related to branch acquisitions in 2003 and 2008 and the acquisition of VCB in 2014. To date, we have not recorded any impairment charges on our goodwill, however there is no guarantee that we may not be forced to recognize impairment charges in the future as operating and economic conditions change. Any material impairment charge would have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s financial results and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nOther-than-temporary impairment could reduce our earnings.\nWe may be required to record other-than-temporary impairment (or \u201cOTTI\u201d) charges on our investment securities if they suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-temporary. Numerous factors, including lack of liquidity for re-sales of certain investment securities, absence of reliable pricing information for certain investment securities, adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulators, or unanticipated changes in the competitive environment could have a negative effect on our securities portfolio in future periods. An OTTI charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur common stock trading volume may not provide adequate liquidity for investors.\nAlthough shares of the Company\u2019s common stock are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the average daily trading volume in the common stock is less than that of many other financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of a sufficient number of willing buyers and sellers of the common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the daily average trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock, significant sales of the common stock in a brief period of time, or the expectation of these sales, could cause a decline in the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nOur common stock and Series B Preferred Stock are not insured deposits.\nOur common stock and non-voting mandatorily convertible non-cumulative preferred stock, Series B (the \u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d) are not bank deposits and, therefore, losses in their value are not insured by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in the Company\u2019s common stock or Series B Preferred stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, and is subject to the same market forces and investment risks that affect the price of capital stock in any other company, including the possible loss of some or all principal invested.", "PERMNO": 85728, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "EVBS"}
