{"cik": "1282631", "company": "NETLIST INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this report in evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the events described below were to occur, our financial condition, our ability to access capital resources, our results of\noperations and/or our future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nRisks related to our business\nWe have historically incurred losses and may continue to incur losses.\nSince the inception of our business in 2000, we have only experienced one fiscal year (2006) with profitable results. In order to regain profitability, or to achieve and sustain positive cash flows from operations in the future, we must reduce operating expenses and/or increase our revenues and gross margins. Although we have in the past engaged in a series of cost reduction actions, and believe that we could reduce our current level of expenses through elimination or reduction of strategic initiatives, such expense reductions alone may not make us profitable or allow us to sustain profitability if it is achieved and eliminating or reducing strategic initiatives could limit our opportunities and prospects. Our ability to achieve profitability will depend on increased revenue growth from, among other things, monetization of our intellectual property, increased demand for our memory subsystems and other product offerings, as well as our ability to expand into new and emerging markets. We may not be successful in achieving the necessary revenue growth or the expected expense reductions. Moreover, we may be unable to sustain past or expected future expense reductions in subsequent periods. We may not achieve profitability or sustain such profitability, if achieved, on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.\nAny failure to achieve profitability could result in increased capital requirements and pressure on our liquidity position. We believe our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our levels of net sales, the timing and extent of expenditures to support sales, marketing, research and development activities, the expansion of manufacturing capacity both domestically and internationally, the continued market acceptance of our products, intellectual property enforcement activities and strategic collaborations or other transactions. Our capital requirements could result in our having to, or otherwise choosing to, seek additional funding through public or private equity offerings or debt financings. Such funding may not be available when needed, on terms acceptable to us or at all, any of which could result in our inability to meet our financial obligations and other related commitments.\nWe may not have sufficient working capital to fund our planned operations, and, as a result, we may need to raise additional capital in the future in order to continue operating our business and developing new products and technologies, which capital may not be available when needed, on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe believe that, taking into account our planned activities, we have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. However, our estimates of our operating expenses and working capital requirements could be incorrect, and we may use our cash resources faster than we presently anticipate. Further, some or all of our ongoing or planned investments may not be successful and could result in further losses. In addition, irrespective of our cash resources, we may be contractually or legally obligated to make certain investments which cannot be postponed.\nOur capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe acceptance of, and demand for, our products;\n\u2022\nour success and that of our strategic partners in developing and selling products derived from our technology;\n\u2022\nour continued listing on NASDAQ;\n\u2022\nthe costs of further developing our existing, and developing new, products or technologies;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we invest in new technology, testing and product development;\n\u2022\nCosts associated with defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe timing of vendor payments and the collection of receivables, among other factors affecting our working capital;\n\u2022\nthe exercise of outstanding options or warrants to acquire our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions in which we participate, if any; and\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with the continued operation, and any future growth, of our business.\nWe expect to rely in the near term on funds raised pursuant to recent public and private placement offerings of debt and equity securities (although we have used certain of those funds to repay certain indebtedness as required by the repayment terms thereof). However, until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we may need to increase our liquidity and capital resources by one or more measures, which may include, among others, reducing operating expenses, restructuring our balance sheet by negotiating with creditors and vendors, entering into strategic partnerships or alliances, raising additional financing through the issuance of debt, equity, or convertible securities and working to increase revenue growth through new product sales. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain capital when needed, on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nInsufficient funds would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations and could cause us to fail to execute our business plan, fail to take advantage of future opportunities or fail to respond to competitive pressures or customer requirements, and further may require us to significantly modify our business model and/or reduce our operations, which could include delaying, scaling back or eliminating some or all of our ongoing and planned investments in corporate infrastructure, research and development projects, regulatory submissions, business development initiatives, and sales and marketing activities, among other investments. Modification of our business model and operations could result in an impairment of assets, the effects of which cannot be determined. Furthermore, if we continue to issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are superior to those of our existing stockholders. If we incur additional debt, it may increase our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization.\nWe have incurred a material amount of indebtedness to fund our operations, the terms of which require that we pledge substantially all of our assets as security. Our level of indebtedness and the terms of such indebtedness, could adversely affect our operations and liquidity.\nWe have incurred debt secured by all of our assets under our credit facilities and term loans with Samsung Venture Investment Corporation (\u201cSVIC\u201d) and Silicon Valley Bank (\u201cSVB\u201d). Our convertible promissory note issued to SVIC is secured by a first priority security interest in our patent portfolio and a second priority security interest in substantially all of our other assets. Our credit facility with SVB is secured by a first priority security interest in all of our assets other than our patent portfolio, to which SVB has a second priority security interest. The SVIC and/or SVB debt instruments contain customary representations, warranties and indemnification provisions, as well as affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness or guarantees;\n\u00b7\nincur liens;\n\u00b7\nmake investments, loans and acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nconsolidate or merge\n\u00b7\nsell, lease, lend, exclusively license or otherwise transfer assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nalter our business;\n\u00b7\nchange any provision of our organizational documents;\n\u00b7\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u00b7\npay dividends or make distributions.\nThe SVIC and SVB debt instruments also include events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, certain bankruptcy events, and certain material adverse\nchanges. If we were to default under either debt instrument and were unable to obtain a waiver for such a default, among other remedies, the lenders could accelerate our obligations under the debt instruments and exercise their rights to foreclose on their security interests, which would cause substantial harm to our business and prospects.\nIncurrence and maintenance of this debt could have material consequences, such as:\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations and other capital resources to debt service, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other cash requirements;\n\u00b7\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in, our business and industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage; and\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to incur additional debt on acceptable terms, if at all.\nOur revenues and results of operations have been substantially dependent on NVvault\u2122 and we may be unable to replace revenue lost from the rapid decline in prior generation NVvault\u2122 sales.\nFor the years ended January 2, 2016 and December 27, 2014, our NVvault\u2122 non-volatile RDIMM used in cache-protection and data logging applications, including our NVvault\u2122 battery-free, the flash-based cache system, accounted for approximately 20% and 44% of total net product sales, respectively. We have experienced a steady decline in NVvault sales in recent years, due in large part to our loss of our most significant NVvault customer, Dell, beginning in 2012. We recognized no NVvault\u2122 sales to Dell in the years ended January 2, 2016 and December 27, 2014. We expect no future demand from Dell for our NVvault\u2122 products. In order to leverage our NVvault\u2122 technology and diversify our customer base, and to secure one or more new key customers, we continue to pursue additional qualifications of NVvault\u2122 with other OEMs and to target new customer applications such as online transaction processing, virtualization, big data analytics, high speed transaction processing, high-performance database, and in-memory database applications. We also introduced EXPRESSvault\u2122 in March 2011 and the next generation of EXPRESSvault\u2122 (EV3) in July 2015 and we continue to pursue qualification of the next generation DDR3 NVvault\u2122 and DDR4 NVvault\u2122 with customers. Our future operating results will depend on our ability to commercialize these NVvault\u2122 product extensions, as well as other products such as HyperVault\u2122 and other high-density and high-performance solutions. HyperVault\u2122 is still under development and may require substantial additional investment and the services and attention of key employees who have competing demands on their available time. Although we believe that our JDLA will advance the development of this product and that Samsung will prove to be an important strategic partner that can facilitate getting this technology to market, our partnership with Samsung and any other steps we take to further the development of this or any other products in development could fail. If we are not be successful in expanding our qualifications or marketing any new or enhanced products, we will be unable to secure revenues sufficient to replace lost NVvault revenue and our results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed.\nWe are subject to risks relating to our focus on developing our HyperCloud\u00ae and NVvault\u2122 products and lack of market diversification.\nWe have historically derived a substantial portion of our net sales from sales of our high-performance memory subsystems for use in the server market. We expect these memory subsystems to continue to account for a portion of our net sales in the near term. We believe that continued market acceptance of these products or derivative products that incorporate our core memory subsystem technology for use in servers is critical to our success.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our research and development budget into the design of ASIC and hybrid devices, including the HyperCloud\u00ae memory subsystem, introduced in November 2009, as well as our NVvault family of products. These products are subject to increased risks as compared to our legacy products. For example:\n\u00b7\nwe are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for both the DRAM ICs and the ASIC devices that are essential to the functionality of the HyperCloud\u00ae memory subsystem, and we have experienced supply chain disruptions and shortages of DRAM and flash required to create our HyperCloud\u00ae, our NVvaultTM and Planar X VLP products as a result of business issues that are specific to our suppliers or the industry as a whole;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to achieve new qualifications or customer or market acceptance of the HyperCloud\u00ae memory subsystem,NVvaultTM products or other new products such as HyperVaultTM, or achieve such acceptance in a timely manner;\n\u00b7\nthe HyperCloud\u00ae memory subsystem, NVvaultTM products or other new products such as HyperVaultTM may contain currently undiscovered flaws, the correction of which would result in increased costs and time to market; and\n\u00b7\nwe are required to demonstrate the quality and reliability of the HyperCloud\u00ae memory subsystem or other new products to our customers, and are required to qualify these new products with our customers, which requires a significant investment of time and resources prior to the receipt of any revenue from such customers.\nWe experienced a longer qualification cycle than anticipated with our HyperCloud\u00ae memory subsystems, and as a result, we have not generated significant HyperCloud\u00ae product revenues to date relative to our investment in the product. We entered into collaborative agreements with both IBM and HP pursuant to which these OEMs qualified the 16GB and 32GB versions of HyperCloud\u00ae for use with their products. While we and each of the OEMs committed financial and other resources toward the collaborations, the efforts undertaken for each of these collaborative agreements have not resulted in significant revenues or product margins for us to date. As a result, we have not achieved and we may never achieve sufficient revenues or margins from our HyperCloud\u00ae products to justify their costs.\nAdditionally, if the demand for servers deteriorates or if the demand for our products to be incorporated in servers declines, our operating results would be adversely affected, and we would be forced to diversify our product portfolio and our target markets. We may not be able to achieve this diversification, and our inability to do so may adversely affect our business.\nWe use a small number of FPGAs, DRAM ICs and NAND flash suppliers and are subject to risks of disruption in the supply of FPGAs, DRAM ICs and NAND flash.\nOur ability to fulfill customer orders or produce qualification samples is dependent on a sufficient supply of field-programmable gate arrays (\u201cFPGAs\u201d), DRAM ICs and NAND flash, which are essential components of our memory subsystems. There are a relatively small number of suppliers of FPGAs, DRAM ICs and NAND flash, and we purchase from only a subset of these suppliers. We have no long-term FPGA, DRAM or NAND flash supply contracts.\nFrom time to time, shortages in DRAM ICs and NAND flash have required some suppliers to limit the supply of their DRAM ICs and NAND flash. We have experienced supply chain disruptions and shortages of DRAM and flash required to create our HyperCloud\u00ae, NVvaultTM and Planar X VLP products, and we are continually working to secure adequate supplies of DRAM and flash necessary to fill customers\u2019 orders for our products in a timely manner. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of DRAM ICs or NAND flash to meet our customers\u2019 requirements, these customers may reduce future orders for our products or not purchase our products at all, which would cause our net sales to decline and harm our operating results. In addition, our reputation could be harmed and, even assuming we are successful in resolving supply chain disruptions, we may not be able to replace any lost business with new customers, and we may lose market share to our competitors.\nOur dependence on a small number of suppliers and the lack of any guaranteed sources of FPGAs, DRAM and NAND flash supply expose us to several risks, including the inability to obtain an adequate supply of these important components, price increases, delivery delays and poor quality.\nHistorical declines in customer demand and our revenues caused us to reduce our purchases of DRAM ICs and NAND flash. Such fluctuations could continue in the future. If we fail to maintain sufficient purchase levels with some suppliers, our ability to obtain supplies of raw materials may be impaired due to the practice of some suppliers to allocate their products to customers with the highest regular demand.\nOur customers qualify the FPGAs, DRAM ICs and NAND flash of our suppliers for use in their systems. If one of our suppliers should experience quality control problems, it may be disqualified by one or more of our customers. This would disrupt our supplies of FPGAs, DRAM ICs and NAND flash and reduce the number of suppliers available to us, and may require that we qualify a new supplier. If our suppliers are unable to produce qualification samples on a timely basis or at all, we could experience delays in the qualification process, which could have a significant impact on our ability to sell that product.\nWe may be unsuccessful in establishing and operating a licensing business.\nAlthough we intend to pursue an intellectual property-based licensing business in order to monetize our intellectual property rights, we are currently operating based on a products-based business model and we may never be successful in developing any licensing business. Although we may pursue an additional agreement with Samsung in the future to grant Samsung a commercial license to our NVDIMM-P technology pursuant to the terms of our JDLA with Samsung, we may never successfully enter into any such agreement with Samsung or any other third party. Further, the terms of any such agreements that we may reach with third party licensees are uncertain and may not provide significant royalty or other licensing revenues to us to justify our costs of developing and maintaining the licensed intellectual property or may otherwise include terms that are not favorable to us. Additionally, the pursuit of a licensing business would require by its nature that we relinquish certain of our rights to our technologies and intellectual property that we license to third parties, which could limit our ability to base our own products on such technologies. Additionally, the establishment of this new business may be more difficult or costly than expected and require additional personnel, investments and may be a significant distraction for management. In connection with any licensing business we may develop, our licenses and royalties revenue may be uncertain from period to period and we may be unable to attract sufficient licensing customers, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Our ability to increase our license revenue will depend on a variety of factors, including novelty, utility, performance, quality, breadth and depth of our current and future intellectual property and technology, all as compared to that of our competitors, as well as our sales and marketing capabilities. Once secured, license revenue may be negatively affected by factors within and outside our control, including reductions in our customers\u2019 sales prices, sales volumes and the terms of such license arrangements. If we are not successful in achieving a licensing business, we may never recoup the costs associated with developing, maintaining, defending and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and our financial condition would be harmed.\nWe may lose our competitive position if we are unable to timely and cost-effectively develop new or enhanced products that meet our customers\u2019 requirements and achieve market acceptance or technologies that we can monetize through licensing arrangements or otherwise.\nOur industry is characterized by intense competition, rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and rapid product obsolescence. Evolving industry standards and technological change or new, competitive technologies could render our existing products and technologies obsolete. Accordingly, our ability to compete in the future will depend in large part on our ability to identify and develop new or enhanced products and technologies on a timely and cost-effective basis, and to respond to changing customer requirements. In order to develop and introduce new or enhanced products and technologies, we need to:\n\u00b7\nidentify and adjust to the changing requirements of our current and potential customers;\n\u00b7\nidentify and adapt to emerging technological trends and evolving industry standards in our markets;\n\u00b7\ndesign and introduce cost-effective, innovative and performance- enhancing features that differentiate our products and technologies from those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\ndevelop relationships with potential suppliers of components required for these new or enhanced products and technologies;\n\u00b7\nqualify these products for use in our customers\u2019 products; and\n\u00b7\ndevelop and maintain effective marketing strategies.\nOur product development efforts are costly and inherently risky. It is difficult to foresee changes or developments in technology or anticipate the adoption of new standards. Moreover, once these changes or developments are identified, if at all, we will need to hire the appropriate technical personnel or retain third-party designers, develop the product, identify and eliminate design flaws, and manufacture the product in production quantities either in-house or through third-party manufacturers. As a result, we may not be able to successfully develop new or enhanced products or we may experience delays in the development and introduction of new or enhanced products. Delays in product development and introduction could result in the loss of, or delays in generating, net sales or other revenues and the loss of market share, as well as damage to our reputation. Even if we develop new or enhanced products or technologies, they may not meet our customers\u2019 requirements or gain market acceptance.\nOur customers require that our products undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process without any assurance of net sales.\nOur prospective customers generally make a significant commitment of resources to test and evaluate our memory subsystems prior to purchasing our products and integrating them into their systems. This extensive qualification process involves rigorous reliability testing and evaluation of our products, which may continue for nine months or longer and is often subject to delays. In addition to qualification of specific products, some of our customers may also require us to undergo a technology qualification if our product designs incorporate innovative technologies that the customer has not previously encountered. Such technology qualifications often take substantially longer than product qualifications and can take over a year to complete. Qualification by a prospective customer does not ensure any sales to that prospective customer. Even after successful qualification and sales of our products to a customer, changes in our products, our manufacturing facilities, our production processes or our component suppliers may require a new qualification process, which may result in additional delays.\nIn addition, because the qualification process is both product specific and platform specific, our existing customers sometimes require us to re-qualify our products, or to qualify our new products, for use in new platforms or applications. For example, as our OEM customers transition from prior generation architectures to current generation architectures, we must design and qualify new products for use by those customers. In the past, the process of design and qualification has taken up to nine months to complete, during which time our net sales to those customers declined significantly. After our products are qualified, it can take several months before the customer begins production and we begin to generate net sales from such customer.\nLikewise, when our memory and NAND flash component vendors discontinue production of components, it may be necessary for us to design and qualify new products for our customers. Such customers may require of us or we may decide to purchase an estimated quantity of discontinued memory components necessary to ensure a steady supply of existing products until products with new components can be qualified. Purchases of this nature may affect our liquidity. Additionally, our estimation of quantities required during the transition may be incorrect, which could adversely impact our results of operations through lost revenue opportunities or charges related to excess and obsolete inventory.\nWe must devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, to qualify our products with prospective customers in anticipation of sales. Significant delays in the qualification process, could result in an inability to keep up with rapid technology change or new, competitive technologies. If we\ndelay or do not succeed in qualifying a product with an existing or prospective customer, we will not be able to sell that product to that customer, which may result in our holding excess and obsolete inventory and harm our operating results and business.\nSales to a limited number of customers represent a significant portion of our net sales and the loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, any one of these customers could materially harm our business.\nSales to certain of our OEM customers have historically represented a substantial majority of our net product sales. Approximately 27% and 10% of our net product sales in the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016 were to two customers. Approximately 20%, 14% and 19% of our net product sales in the fiscal year ended December 27, 2014 were to three customers. The composition of major customers and their respective contributions to our net product sales have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period as our OEMs progress through the life cycle of the products they produce and sell. We do not have long-term agreements with any of our customers and, as such, any or all of them could decide at any time to discontinue, decrease or delay their purchase of our products. In addition, the prices that these customers pay for our products could change at any time. The loss of any of our OEM customers, or a significant reduction in sales to any of them, could significantly reduce our net sales and adversely affect our operating results. Further, we may not be able to sell some products developed for one customer to a different customer because our products are often designed to address specific customer requirements, and even if we are able to sell these products to another customer, our margin on such products may be reduced.\nOur ability to maintain or increase our net sales to our key customers depends on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include our customers\u2019 continued sales of servers and other computing systems that incorporate our memory subsystems and our customers\u2019 continued incorporation of our products into their systems. Because of these and other factors, net sales to these customers may not continue and the amount of such net sales may not reach or exceed historical levels in any future period. Because these customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales, the failure of any one of these customers to pay on a timely basis would negatively impact our cash flow. In addition, while we may not be contractually obligated to accept returned products, we may determine that it is in our best interest to accept returns in order to maintain good relations with our customers.\nA limited number of relatively large potential customers dominate the markets for our products.\nOur target markets are characterized by a limited number of large companies. Consolidation in one or more of our target markets may further increase this industry concentration. As a result, we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be concentrated among a limited number of large customers in the foreseeable future. We believe that our financial results will depend in significant part on our success in establishing and maintaining relationships with, and effecting substantial sales to, these potential customers. Even if we establish and successfully maintain these relationships, our financial results will be largely dependent on these customers\u2019 sales and business results.\nIf a standardized memory solution that addresses the demands of our customers is developed, our net sales and market share may decline.\nMany of our memory subsystems are specifically designed for our OEM customers\u2019 high-performance systems. In a drive to reduce costs and assure supply of their memory module demand, our OEM customers may endeavor to design Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (\u201cJEDEC\u201d) standard DRAM modules into their new products. Although we also manufacture JEDEC modules, this trend could reduce the demand for our higher priced customized memory solutions, which would have a negative impact on our financial results. In addition, the adoption of a JEDEC standard module instead of a previously custom module might allow new competitors to participate in a share of our customers\u2019 memory module business that previously belonged to us.\nIf our OEM customers were to adopt JEDEC standard modules, our future business may be limited to identifying the next generation of high-performance memory demands of OEM customers and developing solutions that address such demands. Until fully implemented, any next generation of products may constitute a significantly smaller market, which would reduce our net sales and market share.\nWe may not be able to maintain our competitive position because of the intense competition in our targeted markets.\nOur products are primarily targeted for the server, high-performance computing and communications markets. These markets are intensely competitive, as numerous companies vie for business opportunities at a limited number of large OEMs. We face competition from DRAM suppliers, memory module providers and logic suppliers for many of our products, including NVvault and HyperCloud\u00ae. Additionally, if and to the extent we enter new markets or pursue licensing arrangements to monetize our technologies and intellectual property portfolio, we may face competition from a large number of competitors that produce solutions utilizing similar or competing technologies.\nSome of our customers and suppliers may have proprietary products or technologies that are competitive with our products, or could develop internal solutions or enter into strategic relationships with, or acquire, existing high-density memory module providers. Any of these actions could reduce our customers\u2019 demand for our products. Some of our significant suppliers of memory integrated circuits may be able to manufacture competitive products at lower costs by leveraging internal efficiencies, or could choose to reduce our supply of memory integrated circuits, adversely affecting our ability to manufacture our memory subsystems on a timely basis, if at all.\nCertain of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, broader product lines, lower cost structures, greater brand recognition and longer standing relationships with customers and suppliers. Some of our competitors may also have a greater ability to influence industry standards than we do, as well as more extensive patent portfolios.\nOur ability to compete in our current target markets and in future markets will depend in large part on our ability to successfully develop, introduce and sell new and enhanced products or technologies on a timely and cost-effective basis and to respond to changing market requirements. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products, reduce their prices and introduce new or enhanced technologies that may offer greater performance and improved pricing. If we are unable to match or exceed the improvements made by our competitors, our market position would deteriorate and our net sales would decline. In addition, our competitors may develop future generations and enhancements of competitive products that may render our technologies obsolete or uncompetitive.\nIf we fail to protect our proprietary rights, our customers or our competitors might gain access to our proprietary designs, processes and technologies, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe rely on a combination of patent protection, trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We have submitted a number of patent applications regarding our proprietary processes and technology. It is not certain when or if any of the claims in the remaining applications will be allowed. As of January 2, 2016, we had 60 U.S. and foreign patents issued and over 33 pending applications worldwide. We intend to continue filing patent applications with respect to most of the new processes and technologies that we develop. However, patent protection may not be available for some of these processes or technologies.\nIt is possible that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not:\n\u00b7\nprevent challenges to, or the invalidation or circumvention of, our existing intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nprevent our competitors from independently developing similar products or technologies, duplicating our products or technologies or designing around any patents that may be issued to us;\n\u00b7\nprevent disputes with third parties regarding ownership of our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nprevent disclosure of our trade secrets and know-how to third parties or into the public domain;\n\u00b7\nresult in valid patents, including international patents, from any of our pending or future applications; or\n\u00b7\notherwise adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\nOthers may attempt to reverse engineer, copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technologies without our consent. Monitoring the unauthorized use of our technologies is difficult. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the unauthorized use of our technologies. This is particularly true in foreign countries, such as the PRC, where we have established a manufacturing facility and where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as applicable U.S. laws.\nIf some or all of the claims in our patent applications are not allowed, or if any of our intellectual property protections are limited in scope by the USPTO or our foreign patents being subjected to invalidation proceedings with their respective authorities, or by a court or circumvented by others, we could face increased competition with regard to our products and be unable to execute on our strategy of monetizing our intellectual property. Increased competition or an inability to monetize our intellectual property could significantly harm our business, our operating results and prospects. Currently four of our patents are the subject of Inter Partes Reexamination proceedings with the USPTO, or appeals therefrom, and we cannot assure you that any of these proceedings will result in an outcome favorable to us.\nWe are involved in and expect to continue to be involved in costly legal and administrative proceedings to defend against claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others or to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights.\nAs is common in the semiconductor industry, we have experienced substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Lawsuits claiming that we are infringing others\u2019 intellectual property rights have been and may in the future be brought against us, and we are currently defending against claims of invalidity in the USPTO.\nThe process of obtaining and protecting patents is inherently uncertain. In addition to the patent issuance process established by law and the procedures of the USPTO, we must comply with JEDEC administrative procedures in protecting our intellectual property within its industry standard setting process. These procedures evolve over time, are subject to variability in their application, and may be inconsistent with each other. Failure to comply with JEDEC\u2019s administrative procedures could jeopardize our ability to claim that our patents have been infringed.\nBy making use of new technologies and entering new markets there is an increased likelihood that others might allege that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights. Litigation is inherently uncertain, and an adverse outcome in existing or any future litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidate our proprietary rights. An adverse outcome also could force us to take specific actions, including causing us to:\n\u00b7\ncease manufacturing and/or selling products, or using certain processes, that are claimed to be infringing a third-party\u2019s intellectual property;\n\u00b7\npay damages (which in some instances may be three times actual damages), including royalties on past or future sales;\n\u00b7\nseek a license from the third-party intellectual property owner to use their technology in our products, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; or\n\u00b7\nredesign those products that are claimed to be infringing a third-party\u2019s intellectual property.\nIf any adverse ruling in any such matter occurs, any resulting limitations in our ability to market our products, or delays and costs associated with redesigning our products or payments of license fees to third parties, or any failure by us to develop or license a substitute technology on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is a limited pool of experienced technical personnel that we can draw upon to meet our hiring needs. As a result, a number of our existing employees have worked for our existing or potential competitors at some point during their careers, and we anticipate that a number of our future employees will have similar work histories. In the past, some of these competitors have claimed that our employees misappropriated their trade secrets or violated non-competition or\nnon-solicitation agreements. Some of our competitors may threaten or bring legal action involving similar claims against us or our existing employees or make such claims in the future to prevent us from hiring qualified candidates. Lawsuits of this type may be brought, even if there is no merit to the claim, simply as a strategy to drain our financial resources and divert management\u2019s attention away from our business.\nOur business strategy also includes litigating claims against others, including our competitors, customers and former employees, to enforce our intellectual property, contractual and commercial rights including, in particular, our trade secrets, as well as to challenge the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. We could become subject to counterclaims or countersuits against us as a result of this litigation. Moreover, any legal disputes with customers could cause them to cease buying or using our products or delay their purchase of our products and could substantially damage our relationship with them.\nAny litigation, regardless of its outcome, would be time consuming and costly to resolve, divert our management\u2019s time and attention and negatively impact our results of operations. As a result, any current or future infringement claims by or against third parties or claims for indemnification by customers or end users of our products resulting from infringement claims could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs a result of the unfavorable outcome in connection with the litigation against Diablo Technologies, Inc., for controller chips used by SanDisk Corporation in its high-speed ULLtraDIMM SSD product line, we may expend significant resources to pursue an appeal in the case, which may not be resolved in a timely manner and may not yield a more favorable outcome. Moreover, the expenses associated with the matter, including a $900,000 bond that has been forfeited, may materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information about this litigation.\nWe may become involved in non-patent related litigation and administrative proceedings that may materially adversely affect us.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Furthermore, because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the results of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operating results may be adversely impacted by worldwide economic and political uncertainties and specific conditions in the markets we address, including the cyclical nature of and volatility in the memory market and semiconductor industry.\nAdverse changes in domestic and global economic and political conditions have made it extremely difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and these conditions have caused and could continue to cause U.S. and foreign businesses to slow spending on our products and services, which would further delay and lengthen sales cycles. In addition, sales of our products are dependent upon demand in the computing, networking, communications, printer, storage and industrial markets. These markets have been cyclical and are characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. These markets have also experienced significant downturns, often connected with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles, reductions in technology spending and declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and the erosion of average selling prices and may result in reduced willingness of potential licensees to enter into license agreement with us.\nWe may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to factors affecting the computing, networking, communications, printers, storage and industrial markets. A decline or significant shortfall in demand in any one of these markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and as a result, our sales would likely decline. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, if we\nare unable to control our expenses adequately in response to reduced sales, our gross margins, operating income and cash flow would be negatively impacted.\nDuring challenging economic times our customers may face issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could impair their ability to make timely payments to us. If that were to occur, we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our ability to timely collect payments would be negatively impacted. Furthermore, our vendors may face similar issues gaining access to credit, which may limit their ability to supply components or provide trade credit to us. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery, either worldwide or in the memory market and related semiconductor industry. If the economy or markets in which we operate do not improve or if conditions worsen, our business, financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, the combination of our lengthy sales cycle coupled with challenging macroeconomic conditions could compound the negative impact on the results of our operations.\nOur lack of a significant backlog of unfilled orders and the difficulty inherent in estimating customer demand makes it difficult to forecast our short-term production requirements to meet that demand, and any failure to optimally calibrate our production capacity and inventory levels to meet customer demand could adversely affect our revenues, gross margins and earnings.\nWe make significant decisions regarding the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements based on our estimates of customer requirements. We do not have long-term purchase agreements with any of our customers. Instead, our customers often place purchase orders no more than two weeks in advance of their desired delivery date, and these purchase orders generally have no cancellation or rescheduling penalty provisions. The short-term nature of commitments by many of our customers, the fact that our customers may cancel or defer purchase orders for any reason, and the possibility of unexpected changes in demand for our customers\u2019 products each reduce our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements for our products. This fact, combined with the quick turn-around times that apply to each order, makes it difficult to forecast our production needs and allocate production capacity efficiently. As a result, we attempt to forecast the demand for the DRAM ICs, NAND flash and other components needed to manufacture our products, but any such forecasts could turn out to be wrong. Further, lead times for components vary significantly and depend on various factors, such as the specific supplier and the demand and supply for a component at a given time.\nOur production expense and component purchase levels are based in part on our forecasts of our customers\u2019 future product requirements and to a large extent are fixed in the short term. As a result, we likely would be unable to adjust spending on a timely basis to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in customer orders. If we overestimate customer demand, we may have excess raw material inventory of DRAM ICs and NAND flash. If there is a subsequent decline in the prices of DRAM ICs or NAND flash, the value of our inventory will fall. As a result, we may need to write-down the value of our DRAM IC or NAND flash inventory, which may result in a significant decrease in our gross margin and financial condition. Also, to the extent that we manufacture products in anticipation of future demand that does not materialize, or in the event a customer cancels or reduces outstanding orders, we could experience an unanticipated increase in our finished goods inventory. In the past, we have had to write-down inventory due to obsolescence, excess quantities and declines in market value below our costs. Any significant shortfall of customer orders in relation to our expectations could hurt our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nAlso, any rapid increases in production required by our customers could strain our resources and reduce our margins. If we underestimate customer demand, we may not have sufficient inventory of DRAM ICs and NAND flash on hand to manufacture enough product to meet that demand. We also may not have sufficient manufacturing capacity at any given time to meet our customers\u2019 demands for rapid increases in production. These shortages of inventory and capacity would lead to delays in the delivery of our products, and we could forego sales opportunities, lose market share and damage our customer relationships.\nDeclines in our average sales prices, driven by volatile prices for DRAM ICs and NAND flash, among other factors, may result in declines in our revenues and gross profit.\nOur industry is competitive and historically has been characterized by declines in average sales price, based in part on the market price of DRAM ICs and NAND flash, which have historically constituted a substantial portion of the total cost of our memory subsystems. Our average sales prices may decline due to several factors, including overcapacity in the worldwide supply of DRAM and NAND flash memory components as a result of worldwide economic conditions, increased manufacturing efficiencies, implementation of new manufacturing processes and expansion of manufacturing capacity by component suppliers.\nOnce our prices with a customer are negotiated, we are generally unable to revise pricing with that customer until our next regularly scheduled price adjustment. Consequently, we are exposed to the risks associated with the volatility of the price of DRAM ICs and NAND flash during that period. If the market prices for DRAM ICs and NAND flash increase, we generally cannot pass the price increases on to our customers for products purchased under an existing purchase order. As a result, our cost of sales could increase and our gross margins could decrease. Alternatively, if there are declines in the price of DRAM ICs and NAND flash, we may need to reduce our selling prices for subsequent purchase orders, which may result in a decline in our expected net sales.\nIn addition, since a large percentage of our sales are to a small number of customers that are primarily distributors and large OEMs, these customers have exerted, and we expect they will continue to exert, pressure on us to make price concessions. If not offset by increases in volume of sales or the sales of newly-developed products with higher margins, decreases in average sales prices would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIf the supply of component materials used to manufacture our products is interrupted or if our inventory becomes obsolete, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe use consumables and other components, including PCBs, to manufacture our memory subsystems. We sometimes procure PCBs and other components from single or limited sources to take advantage of volume pricing discounts. Material shortages or transportation problems could interrupt the manufacture of our products. These delays in manufacturing could adversely affect our results of operations.\nFrequent technology changes and the introduction of next-generation products also may result in the obsolescence of other items of inventory, such as our custom-built PCBs, which could reduce our net sales and gross margin and adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition.\nA prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facility could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain a manufacturing facility in the PRC for producing most of our products, which allows us to utilize our materials and processes, protect our intellectual property and develop the technology for manufacturing. A prolonged disruption or material malfunction of, interruption in or the loss of operations at our manufacturing facility or the failure to maintain a sufficient labor force at such facility could require us to rely on third parties for our manufacturing needs, which generally increases our manufacturing costs and decreases our profit margins and could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment, if necessary, were secured. The replacement of the manufacturing facility could take an extended amount of time before manufacturing operations could restart. The potential delays and costs resulting from these steps could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to manufacture our products efficiently, our operating results could suffer.\nWe must continuously review and improve our manufacturing processes in an effort to maintain satisfactory manufacturing yields and product performance, to lower our costs and to otherwise remain competitive. As we manufacture more complex products, the risk of encountering delays or difficulties increases. The start-up costs\nassociated with implementing new manufacturing technologies, methods and processes, including the purchase of new equipment, and any resulting manufacturing delays and inefficiencies, could negatively impact our results of operations.\nIf we need to add manufacturing capacity, an expansion of our existing manufacturing facility or establishment of a new facility could be subject to factory audits by our customers. Any delays or unexpected costs resulting from this audit process could adversely affect our net sales and results of operations. In addition, we cannot be certain that we would be able to increase our manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or meet the standards of any applicable factory audits.\nWe depend on third-parties to design and manufacture custom components for some of our products.\nSignificant customized components, such as ASICs, that are used in HyperCloud\u00ae and some of our other products are designed and manufactured by third parties. The ability and willingness of such third parties to perform in accordance with their agreements with us is largely outside of our control. If one or more of our design or manufacturing partners fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market or deliver products to our customers, as well as our reputation, could suffer. In the event of any such failures, we may have no readily available alternative source of supply for such products, since, in our experience, the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new design and/or manufacturing partner is at least 12 months, and the estimated time for our OEM customers to re-qualify our product with components from a new vendor ranges from four to nine months. If we need to replace one of our manufacturers, we may not be able to redesign, or cause to have redesigned, our customized components to be manufactured by the new manufacturer in a timely manner, and we could infringe on the intellectual property of our current design or manufacturing partner when we redesign the custom components or cause such components to be redesigned by the new manufacturer. A manufacturing disruption experienced by our manufacturing partners, the failure of our manufacturing partners to dedicate adequate resources to the production of our products, the financial instability of our manufacturing or design partners, or any other failure of our design or manufacturing partners to perform according to their agreements with us would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have many other risks due to our dependence on third-party manufacturers, including: reduced control over delivery schedules, quality, manufacturing yields and cost; the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand; limited warranties on products supplied to us; and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property. We are dependent on our manufacturing partners to manufacture products with acceptable quality and manufacturing yields, to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and to allocate a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs. Although our products are designed using the process design rules of the particular manufacturers, our manufacturing partners may not be able to achieve or maintain acceptable yields or deliver sufficient quantities of components on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. Additionally, our manufacturing partners may not continue to devote adequate resources to produce our products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the qualification and manufacturing of our products are based.\nIf our products do not meet the quality standards of our customers, we may be forced to stop shipments of products until the quality issues are resolved.\nOur customers require our products to meet strict quality standards. Should our products not meet such standards, our customers may discontinue purchases from us until we are able to resolve the quality issues that are causing us to not meet the standards. Such \u201cquality holds\u201d could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and operating results.\nIf our products are defective or are used in defective systems, we may be subject to warranty, product recalls or product liability claims.\nIf our products are defectively manufactured, contain defective components or are used in defective or malfunctioning systems, we could be subject to warranty and product liability claims and product recalls, safety alerts or advisory notices. While we have product liability insurance coverage, it may not be adequate to satisfy claims made against us. We also may be unable to obtain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts.\nAlthough we generally attempt to contractually limit our exposure to incidental and consequential damages, if these contract provisions are not enforced or are unenforceable or if liabilities arise that are not effectively limited, we could incur substantial costs in defending or settling product liability claims.\nWarranty and product liability claims or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and reputation, and on our ability to attract and retain customers. In addition, we may determine that it is in our best interest to accept product returns in circumstances where we are not contractually obligated to do so in order to maintain good relations with our customers. Accepting product returns may negatively impact our operating results.\nIf we are required to obtain licenses to use third-party intellectual property and we fail to do so, our business could be harmed.\nAlthough some of the components used in our final products contain the intellectual property of third parties, we believe that our suppliers bear the sole responsibility to obtain any rights and licenses to such third-party intellectual property. While we have no knowledge that any third-party licensor disputes our belief, we cannot assure you that disputes will not arise in the future. The operation of our business and our ability to compete successfully depends significantly on our continued operation without claims of infringement or demands resulting from such claims, including demands for payments of money in the form of, for example, ongoing licensing fees.\nWe are also developing new products that we intend to launch in new customer markets. Similar to our current products, we may use components in these new products that contain the intellectual property of third parties. While we plan to exercise precautions to avoid infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties, disputes regarding intellectual property ownership could arise.\nIf it is determined that we are required to obtain inbound licenses and we fail to obtain licenses, or if such licenses are not available on economically feasible terms, then we would be forced to redesign the applicable product without the infringing component, which may be costly or not possible, or we may be forced to cease all manufacture and sales of the applicable product. Any such outcome would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe flash memory market is constantly evolving and competitive, and we may not have rights to manufacture and sell certain types of products utilizing emerging flash formats, or we may be required to pay a royalty to sell products utilizing these formats.\nThe flash-based storage market is constantly undergoing rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. Many consumer devices, such as digital cameras, PDAs and smartphones, are transitioning to emerging flash memory formats, such as the Memory Stick and xD Picture Card formats, which we do not currently manufacture and do not have rights to manufacture. Although we do not currently serve the consumer flash market, it is possible that certain OEMs may choose to adopt these higher-volume, lower-cost formats. This could result in a decline in demand, on a relative basis, for other products that we manufacture, such as CompactFlash, SD and embedded USB drives. If we decide to manufacture flash memory products utilizing emerging formats, we would be required to secure licenses to give us the right to manufacture such products that may not be available at reasonable rates or at all. If we are not able to supply flash card formats at competitive prices or if we were to have product shortages, our net sales could be adversely impacted and our customers would likely cancel orders or seek other suppliers to replace us.\nOur indemnification obligations for the infringement by our products of the intellectual property rights of others could require us to pay substantial damages.\nAs is common in our industry, we have in effect a number of agreements in which we have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our customers and suppliers from damages and costs that may arise from the infringement by our products of third-party patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights. The scope of such indemnity varies, but may, in some instances, include indemnification for damages and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees. Our insurance\ndoes not cover intellectual property infringement. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual after execution of the applicable agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. We may periodically have to respond to claims and litigate these types of indemnification obligations. Although our suppliers may bear responsibility for the intellectual property inherent in the components they sell to us, they may lack the financial ability to stand behind such indemnities. Additionally, it may be costly to enforce any indemnifications that they have granted to us. Accordingly, any indemnification claims by customers could require us to incur significant legal fees and could potentially result in the payment of substantial damages, either of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on a few key employees, and if we lose the services of any of these employees or are unable to attract and retain other qualified personnel, our business could be harmed.\nTo date, we have been highly dependent on the experience, relationships and technical knowledge of certain key employees. We believe that our future success will be dependent on our ability to retain the services of these key employees, develop their successors, reduce our reliance on them, and properly manage the transition of their roles should departures occur. The loss of these key employees or their inability to provide their services could delay the development and introduction of, and negatively impact our ability to sell, our products and otherwise harm our business. We do not have employment agreements with any of these key employees other than Chun K. Hong, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. We maintain \u201cKey Man\u201d life insurance on Chun K. Hong; however, we do not carry \u201cKey Man\u201d life insurance on any of our other key employees.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled engineering, manufacturing, and other technical and sales personnel. Competition for experienced personnel is intense. We may not be successful in attracting new engineers or other technical personnel or in retaining or motivating our existing personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain engineers with the skills necessary to keep pace with the evolving technologies in our markets, our ability to continue to provide our current products and to develop new or enhanced products will be negatively impacted, which would harm our business. In addition, a general shortage of experienced engineers could lead to increased recruiting, relocation and compensation costs for such engineers, which may exceed our expectations and resources. These increased costs may make hiring new engineers difficult or may increase our operating expenses.\nHistorically, a significant portion of our workforce has consisted of contract personnel. We invest considerable time and expense in training these contract employees. We may experience high turnover rates in our contract employee workforce, which may require us to expend additional resources in the future. If we convert any of these contract employees into permanent employees, we may have to pay finder\u2019s fees to the contract agency.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers\u2019 representatives to sell our products and the failure of these manufacturers\u2019 representatives to perform as expected could reduce our sales.\nWe sell some of our products to customers through manufacturers\u2019 representatives. We are unable to predict the extent to which our manufacturers\u2019 representatives will be successful in marketing and selling our products. Moreover, many of our manufacturers\u2019 representatives also market and sell other, potentially competing products. Our representatives may terminate their relationships with us at any time. Our future performance will also depend, in part, on our ability to attract additional manufacturers\u2019 representatives that will be able to market and support our products effectively, especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products. If we cannot retain our current manufacturers\u2019 representatives or recruit additional or replacement manufacturers\u2019 representatives, our sales and operating results will be harmed.\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations expose us to significant risks.\nSince 2009, most of our world-wide manufacturing production has been performed at our manufacturing facility in the People\u2019s Republic of China, or PRC. Language and cultural differences, as well as the geographic distance from our headquarters in Irvine, California, further compound the difficulties of running a manufacturing operation in\nthe PRC. Our management has limited experience in creating or overseeing foreign operations, and the ongoing management of our PRC facility may require our management team to divert substantial amounts of their time, particularly if we encounter operational difficulties or manufacturing disruptions at our PRC facility. We may not be able to maintain control over product quality, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs. Furthermore, the costs related to having excess capacity have in the past and may in the future continue to have an adverse impact on our gross margins and operating results.\nWe manage a local workforce that may subject us to regulatory uncertainties. Changes in the labor laws of the PRC could increase the cost of employing the local workforce. The increased industrialization of the PRC, as well as general economic and political conditions in the PRC, could also increase the price of local labor. Any or all combination of these factors could negatively impact the cost savings we currently enjoy from having our manufacturing facility in the PRC.\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our net sales.\nPart of our growth strategy involves making sales to foreign corporations and delivering our products to facilities located in foreign countries. To facilitate this process and to meet the long-term projected demand for our products, we have established a manufacturing facility in the PRC, which performs most of our worldwide manufacturing production. Selling and manufacturing in foreign countries subjects us to additional risks not present with our domestic operations, as we are operating in business and regulatory environments in which we have limited previous experience. Further, the geographic distance from our headquarters in Irvine, California, compounds the difficulties of running a manufacturing operation in the PRC. We will need to continue to overcome language and cultural barriers to effectively conduct our operations in these environments. Changes in the labor laws of the PRC could increase the cost of employing the local workforce. The increased industrialization of the PRC, as well as general economic and political conditions in the PRC, could also increase the price of local labor. Any of these factors could negatively impact the cost savings we experience from locating our manufacturing facility in the PRC. Our management has limited experience creating or overseeing foreign operations, and the ongoing management of our PRC facility may require our management team to divert substantial amounts of their time, particularly if we encounter operational difficulties or manufacturing disruptions at our PRC facility. We may not be able to maintain control over product quality, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs.\nIn addition, the economies of the PRC and other countries have been highly volatile in the past, resulting in significant fluctuations in local currencies and other instabilities. These instabilities affect a number of our customers and suppliers in addition to our own foreign operations.\nIn the future, some of our net sales may be denominated in Chinese Renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d). The Chinese government controls the procedures by which RMB is converted into other currencies, and conversion of RMB generally requires government consent. As a result, RMB may not be freely convertible into other currencies at all times. If the Chinese government institutes changes in currency conversion procedures, or imposes restrictions on currency conversion, those actions may negatively impact our operations and could reduce our operating results. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rate between RMB and U.S. dollars may adversely affect our expenses and results of operations as well as the value of our assets and liabilities. These fluctuations may also adversely affect the comparability of our period-to-period results. If we decide to declare dividends and repatriate funds from our Chinese operations, we will be required to comply with the procedures and regulations of applicable Chinese law. Any changes to these procedures and regulations, or our failure to comply with these procedures and regulations, could prevent us from making dividends and repatriating funds from our Chinese operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition. If we are able to make dividends and repatriate funds from our Chinese operations, these dividends would be subject to U.S. corporate income tax.\nInternational turmoil and the threat of future terrorist attacks, both domestically and internationally, have contributed to an uncertain political and economic climate, both in the U.S. and globally, and have negatively impacted the worldwide economy. The occurrence of one or more of these instabilities could adversely affect our foreign operations and some of our customers or suppliers, which could adversely affect our net sales. In addition, our failure to\nmeet applicable regulatory requirements or overcome cultural barriers could result in production delays and increased turn-around times, which would adversely affect our business.\nOur international sales are subject to other risks, including regulatory risks, tariffs and other trade barriers, timing and availability of export licenses, political and economic instability, difficulties in accounts receivable collections, difficulties in managing distributors, lack of a significant local sales presence, difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals, compliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties and potentially adverse tax consequences. In addition, the U.S. or foreign countries may implement quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of our products, leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country.\nOur operations could be disrupted by power outages, natural disasters or other factors.\nDue to the geographic concentration of our manufacturing operations in our PRC facility and the operations of certain of our suppliers, a disruption resulting from equipment failure, power failures, quality control issues, human error, government intervention or natural disasters, including earthquakes and floods, could interrupt or interfere with our manufacturing operations and consequently harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such disruptions would cause significant delays in shipments of our products and adversely affect our operating results. In July 2014, our PRC facility suffered water damage as a result of heavy rain and floods, which forced us to temporarily halt manufacturing at the facility while necessary repairs or replacements were made to the facility and to certain of our manufacturing equipment. This incident caused us to incur additional expenses as we shifted our manufacturing activities to a third-party manufacturing facility in the PRC to enable us to mitigate the disruption in shipments to our customers. While we believe we have contained the disruptions we expect that our relationships with our key customers could be materially harmed if we incur additional manufacturing disruptions in the future. While we were able to favorably resolve our claim with our insurance carrier, similar events could occur in the future and, in such event, we may not be able to secure alternative manufacturing capabilities if manufacturing at our PRC facility is disrupted.\nDifficulties with our global information technology systems and/or unauthorized access to such systems, could harm our business.\nAny failure or malfunctioning of our global information technology system, errors or misuse by system users, difficulties in migrating standalone systems to our centralized systems, or inadequacy of the system in addressing the needs of our operations could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately manufacture and ship products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such failure, errors, misuse or inadequacy could also disrupt our ability to timely and accurately process, report and evaluate key operations metrics and key components of our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Any such disruptions would likely divert our management and key employees\u2019 attention away from other business matters. Any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our global information technology system could also adversely affect our ability to complete important business process, such as maintenance of our disclosure controls and procedures and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestation activities pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nIn connection with our daily business transactions, we store data about our business, including certain customer data, on our global information technology systems. While our systems are designed with security measures to prevent unauthorized access, third parties may gain unauthorized access to our systems. This unauthorized be the result of intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, employee malfeasance or other causes. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our information technology system for the purpose of sabotage or to access our data, including our and our customers\u2019 intellectual property and other confidential business information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to information technology systems evolve frequently and generally are not recognized until successful, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in disruption to our business, misappropriation or loss of data, loss of confidence in us by our customers, damage to our reputation, legal liability and a negative impact on our sales.\nOur failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant fines and liabilities or cause us to incur significant costs.\nWe are subject to various and frequently changing U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. In particular, some of our manufacturing processes may require us to handle and dispose of hazardous materials from time to time. For example, in the past our manufacturing operations have used lead-based solder in the assembly of our products. Today, we use lead-free soldering technologies in our manufacturing processes, as this is required for products entering the European Union. We could incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, civil or criminal fines or sanctions and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury as a result of violations of, or noncompliance with, environmental laws and regulations. Although we have not incurred significant costs to date to comply with these laws and regulations, new laws or changes to current laws and regulations to make them more stringent could require us to incur significant costs to remain in compliance.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.\nIn August 2012, the SEC adopted a rule requiring disclosure of specified minerals, known as conflict materials, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. The rule requires companies to verify and disclose whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. To comply with this rule, we are required to conduct a reasonable country of origin inquiry each year and, depending on the results of that inquiry, we may be required to exercise due diligence on the source and chain of custody of conflict minerals contained in our products. Such due diligence must conform to a nationally or internationally recognized due diligence framework. We are required to file a disclosure report with the SEC in May of each year relating to the preceding calendar year. In addition, commencing with the disclosure report relating to the 2015 calendar year, to the extent that we are required to exercise due diligence on the source and chain of custody of conflict minerals, we will be required to obtain an independent private sector audit of our disclosure report and underlying due diligence measures.\nThe due diligence activities required to determine the source and chain of custody of minerals contained in our products are time consuming and may result in significant costs. Due to the size and complexity of our supply chain, we face significant challenges in verifying the origins of the minerals used in our products. Further, this rule could affect the availability in sufficient quantities and at competitive prices of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten. There may be only limited number of sources of \u201cconflict-free\u201d minerals, which could result in increased material and component costs, as well as additional costs associated with potential changes to our products, processes or sources of supply.\nIf we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of the minerals used in our products through the due diligence measures that we implement, or if we are unable to obtain an audit report each year that concludes that our due diligence measures are in conformity with the criteria set forth in the relevant due diligence framework, our reputation could be harmed. In addition, we may not be able to satisfy customers who require that our products be certified as \u201cconflict-free,\u201d which could place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, which we collectively refer to as Section 404, require us to evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on these internal controls as of the end of each year. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in our effort to prevent financial fraud. In the course of our Section 404 evaluations, we may identify conditions that may result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses and we may conclude that enhancements, modifications or changes to our internal controls are necessary or desirable.\nImplementing any such changes would divert the attention of our management, could involve significant costs, and may negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe note that there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, as they cannot prevent collusion, management override or failure of human judgment. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations, result in a loss of investor confidence and negatively impact our stock price.\nIf we do not effectively manage any future growth we may experience, our resources, systems and controls may be strained and our results of operations may suffer.\nAny future growth we may experience could strain our resources, management, information and telecommunication systems and operational and financial controls. To manage future growth effectively, including any expansion of volume in our manufacturing facility in the PRC, we must be able to improve and expand our systems and controls. We may not be able to do this in a timely or cost-effective manner, and our current systems and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. In addition, our officers have relatively limited experience in managing a rapidly growing business. As a result, they may not be able to provide the guidance necessary to manage future growth or maintain future market position. Any failure to manage any growth we may experience or improve or expand our existing systems and controls, or unexpected difficulties in doing so, could harm our business.\nIf we acquire businesses or technologies or pursue other strategic transactions in the future, these transactions could disrupt our business and harm our operating results and financial condition.\nWe will evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses or technologies or pursue other strategic transactions, including collaboration or joint development arrangements such as our JDLA with Samsung, that might complement our current product offerings or enhance our intellectual property portfolio or technical capabilities. We have no experience in acquiring other businesses or technologies. Acquisitions and other strategic transactions entail a number of risks that could adversely affect our business and operating results, including, among others:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in integrating the operations, technologies or products of acquired companies or working with third parties with which we may partner on joint development or collaboration relationships;\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from the normal daily operations of the business;\n\u00b7\ninsufficient increases in net sales to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisitions or strategic transaction;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in retaining business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u00b7\nover-estimation of potential synergies or a delay in realizing those synergies;\n\u00b7\nentering markets in which we have no or limited experience and in which competitors have stronger market positions; and\n\u00b7\nthe potential loss of key employees of our or any acquired companies.\nFuture acquisitions or other strategic transactions also could cause us to incur debt or be subject to contingent liabilities. In addition, acquisitions could cause us to issue equity or debt securities that could dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders or increase our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization. Furthermore, acquisitions or other strategic transactions may result in material charges or adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation, deferred compensation charges, in-process research and development charges, the amortization\nof amounts related to deferred stock-based compensation expense and identifiable purchased intangible assets or impairment of goodwill, any or all of which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur results of operations fluctuate significantly and are difficult to predict, and any failure to meet investor or analyst expectations of our performance could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur operating results have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these quarterly and annual fluctuations include, among other, those described in the risk factors in this Item 1A. Due to the various factors described herein and others, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future operating performance. If our quarterly results of operations fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. As a result of the significant fluctuations of our operating results in prior periods, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and investors in our common stock should not rely on the results of any one quarter as an indicator of future performance.\nOur principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interest of our other stockholders.\nAs of February 29, 2016, approximately 11.6% of our outstanding common stock was held by affiliates, including 10.4% held by Chun K. Hong, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors. As a result, Mr. Hong has the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors and any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. This concentration of control could be disadvantageous to other stockholders with interests different from those of Mr. Hong.\nAnti-takeover provisions under our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control and could also limit the market price of our stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. In addition, these provisions could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. The following are examples of provisions which are included in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each as amended:\n\u00b7\nour board of directors is authorized, without prior stockholder approval, to designate and issue preferred stock, commonly referred to as \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nstockholder action by written consent is prohibited;\n\u00b7\nnominations for election to our board of directors and the submission of matters to be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting are subject to advance notice requirements; and\n\u00b7\nour board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors, including delaying or impeding a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest or other change of control transaction involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction\nor changes in our board of directors could prevent the consummation of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the then-current market price for their shares.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and any return to investors is expected to come, if at all, only from potential increases in the price of our common stock.\nWe intend to use all available funds to finance our operations. Accordingly, while payment of dividends rests within the discretion of our board of directors, no cash dividends on our common shares have been declared or paid by us in the past and we have no intention of paying any such dividends in the foreseeable future. Any return to investors is expected to come, if at all, only from potential increases in the price of our common stock.\nThe price of and volume in trading of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock has been publicly traded since November 2006. The price of our common stock and the trading volume of our shares are volatile and have in the past fluctuated significantly. This volatility could continue and an active trading market in our common stock may never develop or be sustained. The market price at which our common stock trades may be influenced by many factors, including, among others, the following:\n\u00b7\nour operating and financial performance and prospects, including our ability to achieve and sustain profitability in the future;\n\u00b7\ninvestor perception of us and the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nthe availability and level of research coverage of and market making in our common stock;\n\u00b7\nresults of litigation;\n\u00b7\nchanges in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts;\n\u00b7\nsales of newly issued common stock or other securities associated with our registration statement on Form S-3, or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u00b7\ngeneral financial and other market conditions; and\n\u00b7\nchanging and recently volatile domestic and international economic conditions.\nIn addition, shares of our common stock and the public stock markets in general have experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme price and trading volume volatility. These fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and a stockholder\u2019s ability to sell its shares into the market at the desired time or at the desired price.\nIn 2007, following a drop in the market price of our common stock, securities litigation was initiated against us. Given the historic volatility of our industry, we may become engaged in this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation, like other types of litigation that are discussed above, is expensive and time-consuming and could subject us to unfavorable results.\nWe may not be able to maintain our NASDAQ listing.\nDuring 2015 and into early 2016, we experienced periods in which we were not compliant with the continued listing standards of The NASDAQ Global Market. As a result of a compliance process, we transferred the listing of our common stock from The NASDAQ Global Market tier to The NASDAQ Capital Market tier. On February 10, 2016, we received a compliance letter from The NASDAQ Stock Market notifying us that we had regained compliance with the applicable requirements for continued listing on The NASDAQ Stock Market. Our common stock continues to trade on\nThe NASDAQ Capital Market tier under the symbol \u201cNLST.\u201d Notwithstanding our current compliance, there can be no assurance that we will continue to comply with the applicable continued listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market. If we are delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market, the liquidity of our common stock may be impaired, which could reduce the trading value of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 91616, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "NLST"}
