{"cik": "1064728", "company": "PEABODY ENERGY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks. The following discussion highlights some of these risks and others are discussed elsewhere in this report. These and other risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects, operating results or cash flows. The following risk factors are not an exhaustive list of the risks associated with our business. New factors may emerge or changes to these risks could occur that could materially affect our business.\nRisks Associated with Our Chapter 11 Cases\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 Cases.\nOn April 13, 2016 (Petition Date), we and a majority of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries as well as one international subsidiary in Gibraltar (the Filing Subsidiaries, and together with Peabody, the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri (the Bankruptcy Court). Our Australian Operations are not included in the filings. Our Chapter 11 Cases are being jointly administered under the caption In re Peabody Energy Corporation, et al., Case No. 16-42529 (the Chapter 11 Cases). On January 27, 2017, the Debtors filed with the Bankruptcy Court the Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization of Debtors and Debtors in Possession (as further modified, the Plan). On March 15, 2017, the Debtors filed an amended version of the Plan, which was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court by order entered March 17, 2017. There can be no assurance that the Plan will be implemented successfully. Until the Plan Effective Date, the Debtors will continue to operate the business as \u201cdebtors-in-possession\u201d under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.\nWe are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, which may lead to potential adverse effects on our liquidity, results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise), brand or business prospects. Our operations, our ability to develop and execute our business plan, our financial condition, our liquidity, and our continuation as a going concern, are all subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 Cases. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nwhether the conditions to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Plan will be satisfied or waived;\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with and operate under any cash management orders by the Bankruptcy Court from time to time;\n\u2022\nthe high costs of Chapter 11 proceedings and related professional costs and fees;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, motivate, and retain key personnel, especially in our current constrained compensation environment;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, employees, and other third parties;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain critical contracts on reasonably acceptable terms and conditions;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain relief from the automatic stay to terminate contracts and other agreements with us;\n\u2022\nthe actions and decisions of our creditors and other third parties who have interests in our Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with our plans;\n\u2022\nour ability to self-bond or obtain adequate surety bonds with respect to our reclamation obligations, both during the Chapter 11 Cases and upon emergence from our Chapter 11 Cases; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that the Chapter 11 Cases will disrupt or impede our international operations, including our Australian Operations.\nThese risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways. For example, negative events or publicity associated with our Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect our relationships with our suppliers, vendors, customers, and employees. In particular, critical suppliers, vendors and customers may determine not to do business with us due to our Chapter 11 Cases, and we may not be successful in securing alternative sources or markets. Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit our ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. Additionally, further losses of key personnel or erosion of employee morale could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer expectations, thereby adversely affecting our business and results of operations. The failure to retain or attract and maintain members of our management team, and other key personnel could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, thereby having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As a result of these risks and uncertainties, we cannot predict the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and there is no certainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2016 Form 10-K\nThe Plan may not become effective.\nWhile the Plan has been confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it may not become effective because it is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent (some of which are beyond our control). There can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied, and therefore, that the Plan will become effective and that the Debtors will emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases as contemplated by the Plan. If the Plan Effective Date is delayed, the Debtors may not have sufficient cash available in order to operate their business. In that case, the Debtors may need new or additional post-petition financing, which may increase the costs of consummating the Plan. There is no assurance of the terms on which such financing may be available or if such financing will be available. If the transactions contemplated by the Plan are not completed, it may become necessary to amend the Plan. The terms of any such amendment are uncertain and could result in material additional expense and result in material delays in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nIf the Plan does not become effective, if current financing is insufficient, or if other financing is not available, we could be required to seek a sale of the Company or certain of its material assets pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, or be required to liquidate under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nIn order to successfully emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a plan of reorganization must become effective. There can be no assurance that the Plan Effective Date will occur, which would permit us to emerge from our Chapter 11 Cases and continue operations. If we are unable to meet our liquidity needs, we may have to take other actions to seek additional financing to the extent available or we could be forced to consider other alternatives to maximize potential recovery for the creditors, including possible sale of the Company or certain material assets pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, or liquidate under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nThere can be no assurance that our current cash position, as well as funds available from our accounts receivable securitization program, and amounts of cash from future operations, will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations during the Chapter 11 Cases. In the event that we do not have sufficient cash to meet our liquidity requirements, and our current financing is insufficient or exit financing is not available in connection with our emergence under a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, we may be required to seek additional financing. There can be no assurance that such additional financing would be available, or, if available, would be available on reasonably acceptable terms. Failure to secure any necessary exit financing, or additional financing, would have a material adverse effect on our operations and ability to continue as a going concern.\nAny plan of reorganization that we may implement will be based in large part upon assumptions and analyses developed by us. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, or adverse market conditions persist or worsen, our plan may be unsuccessful in its execution.\nAny plan of reorganization that we may implement, including the Plan, will affect our capital and the ownership and structure of our business, and will reflect assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we consider appropriate under the circumstances. Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with our expectations and assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to: (i) our ability to substantially change our capital structure; (ii) our ability to obtain adequate liquidity and financing sources; (iii) our ability to maintain customers\u2019 confidence in our viability as a continuing entity and to attract and retain sufficient business from them; (iv) our ability to retain key employees, and (v) the overall strength and stability of general economic conditions of the financial and coal industries, both in the U.S. and in global markets. The failure of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect the successful reorganization of our business.\nIn addition, any plan of reorganization, including the Plan, will rely upon financial projections, including with respect to revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, capital expenditures, debt service, cash flow and coal price projections. Financial projections are necessarily speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be realized. In our case, the forecasts will be even more speculative than normal, because they may involve fundamental changes in the nature of our capital structure. Accordingly, we expect that our actual financial condition and results of operations will differ, perhaps materially, from what we have anticipated. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by any plan of reorganization we may implement will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on us or our business or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could materially and adversely affect the successful execution of any plan of reorganization.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2016 Form 10-K\nCertain claims may not be discharged and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to our filing a petition for reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code or before the confirmation of the Plan (a) were subject to compromise and/or treatment under the Plan and/or (b) will be discharged in accordance with the terms of the Plan on the Plan Effective Date. Any claims not ultimately discharged through the Plan could be asserted against us and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on a post-reorganization basis.\nOperating in bankruptcy for a long period of time may harm our business.\nOur future results will be dependent upon the successful implementation of a plan of reorganization. A long period of operations under Bankruptcy Court protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. So long as the proceedings related to these cases continue, senior management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on business operations. A prolonged period of operating under Bankruptcy Court protection also may make it more difficult to retain management and other key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. In addition, the longer the proceedings related to the Chapter 11 Cases continue, the more likely it is that customers and suppliers will lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully and will seek to establish alternative commercial relationships.\nSo long as the proceedings related to these cases continue, we will be required to incur substantial costs for professional fees and other expenses associated with the administration of the Chapter 11 Cases, including the cost of litigation. In general, litigation can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against. Such litigation could result in settlements or damages that could significantly affect our financial results. It is also possible that certain parties will commence litigation with respect to the treatment of their claims under the Plan. It is not possible to predict the potential litigation that we may become party to, nor the final resolution of such litigation. The impact of any such litigation on our business and financial stability, however, could be material.\nShould the Chapter 11 proceedings continue beyond our current targeted emergence date in early April 2017, we may also need to seek new financing to fund operations. If we are unable to obtain such financing on favorable terms or at all, the chances of successfully reorganizing our business may be seriously jeopardized and the likelihood that we will instead be required to liquidate our assets may increase.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, our historical financial information will not be indicative of our future financial performance and realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities are subject to uncertainty.\nOur capital structure will be significantly altered through the implementation of the Plan. As a result of the consummation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby, we expect to be subject to the fresh start reporting rules required under the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 852, Reorganizations. Under applicable fresh start reporting rules that may apply to us upon the Plan Effective Date, our assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair values and our accumulated deficit would be restated to zero. Accordingly, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations from and after the Plan Effective Date will not be comparable to the financial condition or results of operations reflected in our consolidated historical financial statements.\nIn connection with the implementation of the Plan, it is also possible that additional restructuring and related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such sales, disposals, liquidations, settlements, or charges could be material to our consolidated financial position and the results of operations in any given period.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2016 Form 10-K\nOur ability to use our pre-emergence tax attributes may be significantly limited under the U.S. federal income tax rules.\nWe have generated net operating losses and certain tax credits for U.S. federal income tax purposes (NOLs) through the taxable year ending December 31, 2016. We expect to incur substantial additional NOLs through the Plan Effective Date. Our NOLs and other tax attributes, including our tax basis in assets, are subject to reduction on account of cancellation of indebtedness income. Moreover, our ability to use any remaining NOLs and other tax attributes, and possibly any recognized built in losses, to offset future taxable income or taxes owed may be significantly limited if we undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the Code) in connection with the Plan and do not qualify or elect to use a special bankruptcy rule. An entity that experiences an ownership change generally is subject to an annual limitation on its use of its pre-ownership change NOLs and other tax attributes after the ownership change equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate posted by the Internal Revenue Service (subject to certain adjustments). If we undergo an ownership change in connection with the Plan, however, we will be allowed to calculate the limitation on NOLs and other tax attributes, in general, by reference to our equity value immediately after the ownership change (rather than the equity value immediately before the ownership change, as is the case under the general rule for non-bankruptcy ownership changes), thus generally reflecting any increase in the value of the stock due to the cancellation of debt resulting from the Plan. The annual limitation could also be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. Alternatively, if we qualify for and elect to use a special bankruptcy rule that would prevent a limitation on use of the tax attributes from applying, our NOLs would first be reduced to the extent of certain prior interest deductions taken on account of indebtedness that will be converted into equity under the Plan, but the annual limitation would be zero and we will lose the use of the entire NOLs in the event we experience another ownership change within two years after the Plan Effective Date. We anticipate that we will experience an ownership change as a result of the Plan; accordingly, the ability to use pre-change tax attributes to offset our future taxable income or taxes owed pre-ownership may be significantly limited.\nConsummation of the Plan may impair certain of the tax assets of our Australian operations.\nOur Australian operations have had significant net operating losses for Australian income tax purposes (Australian NOLs) through the taxable year ending December 31, 2016. The use of Australian NOLs is subject to our Australian operations satisfying the Continuity of Ownership Test (COT) in the first instance, or if that test is failed, the Same Business Test (the SBT). If our Australian operations satisfy either the COT or the SBT, they can apply Australian NOLs against Australian taxable income.\nOur Australian operations currently rely on concessional ownership tracing rules to support the position that the operations continue to satisfy the COT. However, continuing to satisfy the COT depends upon there being at least 50 stockholders at all times prior to, during and immediately after the consummation of the Plan, of which 20 stockholders or fewer are not able to control 75% of the rights to vote, entitlement to dividends or rights to distributions on winding up. It is possible that the consummation of the Plan may cause our Australian operations to fail the COT. Should that happen, our Australian operations are able to fall back on the SBT, which generally requires that from the time the losses were incurred until the income year in which the Australian NOLs are sought to be used, the operations carried on substantially the same business and that during the same period the group did not enter into any new transactions of a kind it had previously not entered into. In the event that our Australian operations cannot satisfy either the COT or the SBT, although the NOLs are not technically canceled, the Australian NOLs cannot be used.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2016 Form 10-K\nRisks Associated with Our Operations\nOur profitability depends upon the prices we receive for our coal.\nWe operate in a competitive and highly regulated industry that for years has experienced strong headwinds. Decreased prices in the first three quarters of 2016 have reduced our revenues. For example, our revenues decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 by $893.9 million, primarily due to lower realized pricing and lower sales volumes driven by various demand and production factors. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the coal industry saw sharp upturns in seaborne metallurgical and thermal coal pricing primarily due to restrictive production policies in China. However, these recent industry events do not demonstrate that these prices will be sustainable in the future and the vast majority of third-party analysts project that prices are likely to decline. If coal prices decrease or return to depressed levels, our operating results and profitability and value of our coal reserves could be materially and adversely affected.\nCoal prices are dependent upon factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe demand for electricity;\n\u2022\nthe strength of the global economy;\n\u2022\nthe relative price of natural gas and other energy sources used to generate electricity;\n\u2022\nthe demand for electricity and capacity utilization of electricity generating units (whether coal or non-coal);\n\u2022\nthe demand for steel, which may lead to price fluctuations in the monthly and quarterly repricing of our metallurgical coal contracts;\n\u2022\nthe global supply and production costs of thermal and metallurgical coal;\n\u2022\nchanges in the fuel consumption and dispatch patterns of electric power generators;\n\u2022\nweather patterns and natural disasters;\n\u2022\ncompetition within our industry and the availability, quality and price of alternative fuels, including natural gas, fuel oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, biomass and solar power;\n\u2022\nthe proximity, capacity and cost of transportation and terminal facilities;\n\u2022\ncoal and natural gas industry output and capacity;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulations and taxes, including those establishing air emission standards for coal-fueled power plants or mandating or subsidizing increased use of electricity from renewable energy sources;\n\u2022\nregulatory, administrative and judicial decisions, including those affecting future mining permits and leases; and\n\u2022\ntechnological developments, including those related to alternative energy sources, those intended to convert coal-to-liquids or gas and those aimed at capturing, using and storing carbon dioxide.\nIn the U.S., our strategy is to selectively renew, or enter into new, long-term supply agreements when we can do so at prices we believe are favorable. In Australia we negotiate pricing for metallurgical coal contracts quarterly and seaborne thermal coal contracts annually, with a substantial portion sold on a shorter-term basis.\nThermal coal accounted for the majority of our coal sales during 2015 and 2016. The vast majority of our sales of thermal coal were to electric power generators. The demand for coal consumed for electric power generation is affected by many of the factors described above, but primarily by (i) the overall demand for electricity; (ii) the availability, quality and price of competing fuels, such as natural gas, nuclear fuel, oil and alternative energy sources; (iii) utilization of all electricity generating units (whether using coal or not), including the relative cost of producing electricity from all fuels, including coal; (iv) increasingly stringent environmental and other governmental regulations; and (v) the coal inventories of utilities. Gas-fueled generation has displaced and is expected to continue to displace coal-fueled generation, particularly from older, less efficient coal-powered generators. Many of the new power plants in the U.S. may be fueled by natural gas because gas-fired plants are viewed as cheaper to construct and permits to construct these plants are easier to obtain as natural gas is seen as having a lower environmental impact than coal-fueled generators. Increasingly stringent regulations along with flat electricity demand have also reduced the number of new power plants being built. These trends have reduced demand for our coal and the related prices. Any further reduction in the amount of coal consumed by electric power generators could reduce the volume and price of coal that we mine and sell.\nLower demand for metallurgical coal by steel producers would reduce our revenues and could further reduce the price of our metallurgical coal. We produce metallurgical coal that is used in the global steel industry. Metallurgical coal accounted for approximately 21% and 23% our coal sales revenue in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Deteriorating conditions in the steel industry, including the demand for steel and the continued financial condition of the industry, could reduce the demand for our metallurgical coal. Lower demand for metallurgical coal in international markets would reduce the amount of metallurgical coal that we sell and the prices that we receive for it, thereby reducing our revenues and adversely impacting our earnings and the value of our coal reserves.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2016 Form 10-K\nAdditionally, we compete with numerous other domestic and foreign coal producers for domestic and international sales. This competition affects domestic and foreign coal prices and our ability to attract and retain customers. The balance between coal demand and supply within the coal industry, factoring in demand and supply of closely related and competing segments such as natural gas, both domestically and internationally, could materially reduce coal prices and therefore materially reduce our revenues and profitability. We compete with producers of other low cost fuels used for electricity generation, such as natural gas and renewables. Declines in the price of natural gas, or continued low natural gas prices, could cause demand for coal to decrease and adversely affect the price of coal. Sustained periods of low natural gas prices or other fuels may also cause utilities to phase out or close existing coal-fired power plants or reduce construction of new coal-fired power plants, which could have a material adverse effect on demand and prices for our coal, thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations.\nIf a substantial number of our long-term coal supply agreements terminate, our revenues and operating profits could suffer if we are unable to find alternate buyers willing to purchase our coal on comparable terms to those in our contracts.\nMost of our sales are made under coal supply agreements, which are important to the stability and profitability of our operations. The execution of a satisfactory coal supply agreement is frequently the basis on which we undertake the development of coal reserves required to be supplied under the contract, particularly in the U.S.\nMany of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that permit the parties to adjust the contract price upward or downward at specified times. We may adjust these contract prices based on inflation or deflation and/or changes in the factors affecting the cost of producing coal, such as taxes, fees, royalties and changes in the laws regulating the mining, production, sale or use of coal. In a limited number of contracts, failure of the parties to agree on a price under those provisions may allow either party to terminate the contract. We sometimes experience a reduction in coal prices in new long-term coal supply agreements replacing some of our expiring contracts. Coal supply agreements also typically contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by us or the customer during the duration of specified events beyond the control of the affected party. Most of our coal supply agreements contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal meeting quality thresholds for certain characteristics such as Btu, sulfur content, ash content, grindability and ash fusion temperature. Failure to meet these specifications could result in economic penalties, including price adjustments, the rejection of deliveries or termination of the contracts. Moreover, some of these agreements allow our customers to terminate their contracts in the event of changes in regulations affecting our industry that restrict the use or type of coal permissible at the customer\u2019s plant or increase the price of coal beyond specified limits.\nThe operating profits we realize from coal sold under supply agreements depend on a variety of factors. In addition, price adjustment and other provisions may increase our exposure to short-term coal price volatility provided by those contracts. If a substantial portion of our coal supply agreements were modified or terminated, we could be materially adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to find alternate buyers for our coal at the same level of profitability. Prices for coal vary by mining region and country. As a result, we cannot predict the future strength of the coal industry overall or by mining region and cannot provide assurance that we will be able to replace existing long-term coal supply agreements at the same prices or with similar profit margins when they expire.\nThe loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our revenues.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we derived 28% of our total revenues from our five largest customers, similar to the prior year. Those five customers were supplied primarily from 24 coal supply agreements (excluding trading transactions) expiring at various times from 2017 to 2026. On an ongoing basis, we discuss the extension of existing agreements or entering into new long-term agreements with various customers, but these negotiations may not be successful and these customers may not continue to purchase coal from us under long-term supply agreements. If a number of these customers significantly reduce their purchases of coal from us, or if we are unable to sell coal to them on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current agreements, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially. In addition, our revenue could be adversely affected by a decline in customer purchases (including contractually obligated purchases) due to lack of demand and oversupply, cost of competing fuels and environmental and other governmental regulations.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2016 Form 10-K\nOne of our five largest customers is served by a single Peabody mine, included in our Western U.S. Mining operations, that has no other customers. Given the mine\u2019s location, it is currently unable to economically market its coal to other utility customers. This mine has a contract to supply coal to the customer\u2019s coal-fueled power plant through December 2019. The customer is owned by several private companies and one governmental entity. The non-governmental owners of the customer recently completed an evaluation of the plant and determined to continue operating the plant through December 2019, subject to certain conditions. Those non-governmental owners of the plant then issued a statement that they do not currently intend to be the operators the plant beyond December 2019; however, the United States Bureau of Reclamation -- also an owner of the customer -- has stated that it is investigating ways to continue operating the plant. The Company is currently discussing with the customer options to improve the plant\u2019s economics. If the customer closes the plant, our Western U.S. Mining operations revenues, Adjusted EBITDA and cash flows would be materially reduced. We could also incur accelerated costs related to the mine\u2019s closure and may be required to record asset impairment charges.\nOur trading and hedging activities no longer cover certain risks, and may expose us to earnings volatility and other risks, including increasing requirements to post collateral.\nWe historically entered into hedging arrangements designed primarily to manage market price volatility of foreign currency (primarily the Australian dollar), diesel fuel and coal. Currently, we primarily enter into hedging arrangements designed to manage coal industry price through our trading and marketing functions; however, we may in the future enter into hedging arrangements to manage the volatility of foreign currency, diesel fuel, or other matters.\nSome of these derivative trading instruments require us to post margin based on the value of those instruments and other credit factors. If the fair value of our hedge portfolio moves significantly, or if laws or regulations are passed requiring all hedge arrangements to be exchange-traded or exchange-cleared, we could be required to post additional margin. In addition, as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases and the volatility in global markets, we have increasingly been required to post margin under the requirements of these instruments. Further requirements to post margin could negatively impact our liquidity.\nThrough our trading and hedging activities, we are also exposed to nonperformance and credit risk with various counterparties, including exchanges and other financial intermediaries. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements, which could negatively impact our profitability and/or liquidity.\nWe are currently subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk for non-U.S. dollar expenditures and balances and price risk on diesel fuel utilized in our mining operations. As noted above, we have historically used derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, swaps and options, designated as cash flow hedges, to manage these risks. The Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default under these derivative financial instruments and the counterparties terminated the agreements shortly thereafter in accordance with contractual terms. As a result, we will be exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and the risk of fluctuations in the price of fuel.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and financial market conditions.\nOur profits are affected, in large part, by industry conditions. Industry conditions are subject to a variety of factors beyond our control. In recent years, the global economic recession and the worldwide financial and credit market disruptions had a negative impact on us and on the coal industry generally. These conditions, among other factors, led to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases. If any of these conditions return, if coal prices continue at or below levels experienced in 2015 and early 2016 for a prolonged period or if there are further downturns in economic conditions, particularly in developing countries such as China and India, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. While we are focused on cost control, productivity improvements, increased contributions from our higher-margin operations and capital discipline, there can be no assurance that these actions, or any others we may take, will be sufficient in response to challenging economic and financial conditions.\nOur ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness or contractual performance deteriorates.\nOur ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered or for financially settled contracts will depend on the continued creditworthiness and contractual performance of our customers and counterparties. Our customer base has changed with deregulation in the U.S. as utilities have sold their power plants to their non-regulated affiliates or third parties. These new customers may have credit ratings that are below investment grade or are not rated. If deterioration of the creditworthiness of our customers occurs or if they fail to perform the terms of their contracts with us, our accounts receivable securitization program and our business could be adversely affected.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2016 Form 10-K\nRisks inherent to mining could increase the cost of operating our business.\nOur mining operations are subject to conditions that can impact the safety of our workforce, or delay coal deliveries or increase the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time. These conditions include:\n\u2022\nfires and explosions from methane gas or coal dust;\n\u2022\naccidental mine water discharges;\n\u2022\nweather, flooding and natural disasters; unexpected maintenance problems;\n\u2022\nunforeseen delays in implementation of mining technologies that are new to our operations;\n\u2022\nkey equipment failures;\n\u2022\nvariations in coal seam thickness;\n\u2022\nvariations in coal quality;\n\u2022\nvariations in the amount of rock and soil overlying the coal deposit;\n\u2022\nvariations in rock and other natural materials; and\n\u2022\nvariations in geologic conditions.\nWe maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some of these risks, although there can be no assurance that these risks would be fully covered by our insurance policies. Despite our efforts, such conditions could occur and have a substantial impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nIf transportation for our coal becomes unavailable or uneconomic for our customers, our ability to sell coal could suffer.\nTransportation costs represent a significant portion of the total cost of coal use and the cost of transportation is a critical factor in a customer\u2019s purchasing decision. Increases in transportation costs and the lack of sufficient rail and port capacity could lead to reduced coal sales.\nWe depend upon rail, barge, trucking, overland conveyor and ocean-going vessels to deliver coal to our customers. While our coal customers typically arrange and pay for transportation of coal from the mine or port to the point of use, disruption of these transportation services because of weather-related problems, infrastructure damage, strikes, lock-outs, lack of fuel or maintenance items, underperformance of the port and rail infrastructure, congestion and balancing systems which are imposed to manage vessel queuing and demurrage, non-performance or delays by co-shippers, transportation delays or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to our customers and thus could adversely affect our results of operations.\nA decrease in the availability or increase in costs of key supplies, capital equipment or commodities such as diesel fuel, steel, explosives and tires could decrease our anticipated profitability.\nOur mining operations require a reliable supply of mining equipment, replacement parts, fuel, explosives, tires, steel-related products (including roof control materials), lubricants and electricity. There has been some consolidation in the supplier base providing mining materials to the coal industry, such as with suppliers of explosives in the U.S. and both surface and underground equipment globally, that has limited the number of sources for these materials. In situations where we have chosen to concentrate a large portion of purchases with one supplier, it has been to take advantage of cost savings from larger volumes of purchases and to ensure security of supply. If the cost of any of these inputs increased significantly, or if a source for these supplies or mining equipment were unavailable to meet our replacement demands, our profitability could be reduced or we could experience a delay or halt in our production.\nTake-or-pay arrangements within the coal industry could unfavorably affect our profitability.\nWe have substantial take-or-pay arrangements, predominately in Australia, totaling $1.6 billion, with terms ranging up to 26 years, that commit us to pay a minimum amount for rail and port commitments for the delivery of coal even if those commitments go unused. The take-or-pay provisions in these contracts sometimes allow us to apply amounts paid for subsequent deliveries, but these provisions have limitations and we may not be able to apply all such amounts so paid in all cases. Also, we may not be able to utilize the amount of capacity for which we have previously paid. Additionally, coal companies, including us, may continue to deliver coal during times when it might otherwise be optimal to suspend operations because these take-or-pay provisions effectively convert a variable cost of selling coal to a fixed operating cost.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2016 Form 10-K\nAn inability of trading, brokerage, mining or freight counterparties to fulfill the terms of their contracts with us could reduce our profitability.\nIn conducting our trading, brokerage and mining operations, we utilize third-party sources of coal production and transportation, including contract miners and brokerage sources, to fulfill deliveries under our coal supply agreements. We have completed several conversions to owner-operator status at certain of our Australian operations. Employee relations at mines that use contractors are the responsibility of the contractor.\nOur profitability or exposure to loss on transactions or relationships is dependent upon the reliability (including financial viability) and price of the third-party suppliers; our obligation to supply coal to customers in the event that weather, flooding, natural disasters or adverse geologic mining conditions restrict deliveries from our suppliers; our willingness to participate in temporary cost increases experienced by our third-party coal suppliers; our ability to pass on temporary cost increases to our customers; the ability to substitute, when economical, third-party coal sources with internal production or coal purchased in the market and the ability of our freight sources to fulfill their delivery obligations. Market volatility and price increases for coal or freight on the international and domestic markets could result in non-performance by third-party suppliers under existing contracts with us, in order to take advantage of the higher prices in the current market. Such non-performance could have an adverse impact on our ability to fulfill deliveries under our coal supply agreements.\nWe may not recover our investments in our mining, exploration and other assets, which may require us to recognize impairment charges related to those assets.\nThe value of our assets may be adversely affected by numerous uncertain factors, some of which are beyond our control, including unfavorable changes in the economic environments in which we operate, lower-than-expected coal pricing, technical and geological operating difficulties, an inability to economically extract our coal reserves and unanticipated increases in operating costs. These may cause us to fail to recover all or a portion of our investments in those assets and may trigger the recognition of impairment charges in the future, which could have a substantial impact on our results of operations. This may be mitigated by our application of fresh start reporting rules.\nAs described in Note 4. \"Asset Impairment\" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we recognized aggregate asset impairment costs of $247.9 million, $1,277.8 million and $154.4 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Because of the volatile and cyclical nature of U.S. and international coal markets, it is reasonably possible that our current estimates of projected future cash flows from our mining assets may change in the near term, which may result in the need for further adjustments to the carrying value of those assets or adjustments to assets not previously impaired.\nOur ability to operate our company effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel or fail to attract qualified personnel.\nWe manage our business with a number of key personnel, the loss of whom could have a material adverse effect on us, absent the completion of an orderly transition. In addition, we believe that our future success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel, particularly personnel with mining experience. We cannot provide assurance that key personnel will continue to be employed by us or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 6,700 employees (excluding employees that were employed at operations classified as discontinued), which included approximately 5,100 hourly employees. Approximately 39% of our hourly employees were represented by organized labor unions and generated approximately 22% of 2016 coal production for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016. Relations with our employees and, where applicable, organized labor are important to our success. If some or all of our current non-union operations were to become unionized, we could incur an increased risk of work stoppages, reduced productivity and higher labor costs. Also, if we fail to maintain good relations with our union workforce, we could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could negatively impact our profitability.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2016 Form 10-K\nWe could be adversely affected if we fail to appropriately provide financial assurances for our obligations.\nU.S. federal and state laws and Australian laws require us to provide financial assurances related to requirements to reclaim lands used for mining, to pay federal and state workers\u2019 compensation, to provide financial assurances for coal lease obligations and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations. The primary methods we use to meet those obligations are to post a corporate guarantee (i.e., self-bond), provide a third-party surety bond or provide a letter of credit. As of December 31, 2016, we had $1,094.2 million of self-bonding in place for our U.S. coal mine reclamation obligations. As of December 31, 2016, we also had outstanding surety bonds with third parties, bank guarantees and letters of credit of $921.3 million, of which $607.5 million was for post-mining reclamation, $61.8 million related to workers\u2019 compensation and other insurance obligations, $94.0 million was for coal lease obligations and $158.0 million was for other obligations, including road maintenance and performance guarantees. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we had posted letters of credit and cash collateral in support of these financial instruments of $429.5 million. During 2015 and 2016, we were required to increase our total posted letters of credit to the issuing parties of certain of our surety bonds and bank guarantees, whereas we had not previously been required to do so. Surety bond issuers may demand additional collateral, which may in turn affect our available liquidity.\nOur bonding obligations may increase due to a number of factors, and, upon our emergence from Chapter 11 or otherwise, we may not continue to qualify to self-bond or self-bonding programs may be terminated. Alternative forms of financial assurance such as surety bonds and letters of credit may not be available to us. Our failure to retain, or inability to obtain surety bonds, bank guarantees or letters of credit, or to provide a suitable alternative, could have a material adverse effect on us. That failure could result from a variety of factors including the following:\n\u2022\nlack of availability, higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new surety bonds; and\n\u2022\ninability to provide or fund collateral for current and future third-party surety bond issuers.\nOur failure to maintain adequate bonding would invalidate our mining permits and prevent mining operations from continuing, which would cast substantial doubt on our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur mining operations are extensively regulated, which imposes significant costs on us, and future regulations and developments could increase those costs or limit our ability to produce coal.\nThe coal mining industry is subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities with respect to matters such as:\n\u2022\nemployee health and safety;\n\u2022\nlimitations on land use;\n\u2022\nmine permitting and licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nreclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed;\n\u2022\nthe storage, treatment and disposal of wastes;\n\u2022\nremediation of contaminated soil, sediment and groundwater;\n\u2022\nair quality standards;\n\u2022\nwater pollution;\n\u2022\nprotection of human health, plant-life and wildlife, including endangered or threatened species and habitats;\n\u2022\nprotection of wetlands;\n\u2022\nthe discharge of materials into the environment; and\n\u2022\nthe effects of mining on surface water and groundwater quality and availability.\nRegulatory agencies have the authority under certain circumstances following significant health and safety incidents to order a mine to be temporarily or permanently closed. In the event that such agencies ordered the closing of one of our mines, our production and sale of coal would be disrupted and we may be required to incur cash outlays to re-open the mine. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe possibility exists that new legislation or regulations and orders, including without limitation related to the environment or employee health and safety may be adopted and may materially adversely affect our mining operations, our cost structure or our customers\u2019 ability to use coal. New legislation or administrative regulations (or new interpretations by the relevant government of existing laws and regulations), including proposals related to the protection of the environment or the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions that would further regulate and tax the coal industry, may also require us or our customers to change operations significantly or incur increased costs. Some of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that allow a purchaser to terminate its contract if legislation is passed that either restricts the use or type of coal permissible at the purchaser\u2019s plant or results in specified increases in the cost of coal or its use. These factors and legislation, if enacted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2016 Form 10-K\nFor additional information about the various regulations affecting us, see the sections entitled \u201cRegulatory Matters -U.S.\u201d and \u201cRegulatory Matters - Australia\u201d.\nOur operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our properties may have environmental contamination, which could result in material liabilities to us.\nOur operations currently use hazardous materials and generate limited quantities of hazardous wastes from time to time. A number of laws, including in the U.S., CERCLA and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), impose liability relating to contamination by hazardous substances. Such liability may involve the costs of investigating or remediating contamination and damages to natural resources, as well as claims seeking to recover for property damage or personal injury caused by hazardous substances. Such liability may arise from conditions at formerly, as well as currently, owned or operated properties, and at properties to which hazardous substances have been sent for treatment, disposal or other handling. Liability under RCRA, CERCLA and similar state statutes is without regard to fault, and typically is joint and several, meaning that a person may be held responsible for more than its share, or even all, of the liability involved.\nWe may be unable to obtain and renew permits necessary for our operations, which would reduce our production, cash flows and profitability.\nNumerous governmental and tribal permits and approvals are required for mining operations. The permitting rules, and the interpretations of these rules, are complex and are often subject to discretionary interpretations by regulators, all of which may make compliance more difficult or impractical. As part of this permitting process, when we apply for permits and approvals, we are required to prepare and present to governmental authorities data pertaining to the potential impact or effect that any proposed exploration for or production of coal may have upon the environment. The public, including non-governmental organizations, opposition groups and individuals, have statutory rights to comment upon and submit objections to requested permits and approvals (including modifications and renewals of certain permits and approvals). In recent years, the permitting required for coal mining has been the subject of increasingly stringent regulatory and administrative requirements and extensive litigation by environmental groups.\nThe costs, liabilities and requirements associated with these permitting requirements and opposition may be costly and time-consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production and as a result, adversely affect our coal production, cash flows and profitability. Further, required permits may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion or at all, or permits issued or renewed may be conditioned in a manner that may restrict our ability to efficiently and economically conduct our mining activities, any of which would materially reduce our production, cash flow and profitability.\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) regulates certain activities affecting navigable waters and waters of the U.S., including wetlands. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) requires mining companies like us to obtain Corps permits to place material in streams for the purpose of creating slurry ponds, water impoundments, refuse areas, valley fills or other mining activities. In recent years, the Section 404 permitting process has been subject to increasingly stringent regulatory and administrative requirements and a series of court challenges, which have resulted in increased costs and delays in the permitting process. Additionally, increasingly stringent requirements governing coal mining also are being considered or implemented under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit process and various other environmental programs. Potential laws, regulations and policies could result in material adverse impacts on our operations, financial condition or cash flow, in view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these potential laws, regulations and policies.\nOur mining operations are subject to extensive forms of taxation, which imposes significant costs on us, and future regulations and developments could increase those costs or limit our ability to produce coal competitively.\nFederal, state, provincial or local governmental authorities in nearly all countries across the global coal mining industry impose various forms of taxation, including production taxes, sales-related taxes, royalties, environmental taxes, mining profits taxes and income taxes. If new legislation or regulations related to various forms of coal taxation, which increase our costs or limit our ability to compete in the areas in which we sell our coal, are adopted, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2016 Form 10-K\nIf the assumptions underlying our asset retirement obligations for reclamation and mine closures are materially inaccurate, our costs could be significantly greater than anticipated.\nOur asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws in the U.S. and Australia as defined by each mining permit. These obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of these cash flows, which is driven by the estimated economic life of the mine and the applicable reclamation laws. These cash flows are discounted using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. Our management and engineers periodically review these estimates. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation, mine closing and post-closure activities. The resulting estimated asset retirement obligation could change significantly if actual amounts change significantly from our assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to continue acquiring and developing coal reserves that are economically recoverable.\nOur recoverable reserves decline as we produce coal. We have not yet applied for the permits required or developed the mines necessary to use all of our reserves. Moreover, the amount of proven and probable coal reserves described in Part I, Item 2. \u201cProperties\u201d involves the use of certain estimates and those estimates could be inaccurate. Information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff. Some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable coal reserve estimates include geological conditions, historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas, the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future prices and future operating costs. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our coal reserves may vary materially from estimates.\nOur future success depends upon our conducting successful exploration and development activities or acquiring properties containing economically recoverable reserves. Our current strategy includes increasing our reserves through acquisitions of government and other leases and producing properties and continuing to use our existing properties and infrastructure. In certain locations, leases for oil, natural gas and coalbed methane reserves are located on, or adjacent to, some of our reserves, potentially creating conflicting interests between us and lessees of those interests. Other lessees\u2019 rights relating to these mineral interests could prevent, delay or increase the cost of developing our coal reserves. These lessees may also seek damages from us based on claims that our coal mining operations impair their interests. Additionally, the U.S. federal government limits the amount of federal land that may be leased by any company to 75,000 acres in any one state and 150,000 acres nationwide. As of December 31, 2016, we leased a total of 59,626 acres from the federal government subject to those limitations. Many of these leases are in place for the next 20 years. On January 15, 2016, the Interior Department announced that it will perform a review of the federal coal leasing program. At that time, the Interior Department ordered a pause on issuing new coal leases which the Interior Department stated would continue for three years while the review of the federal coal leasing program occurs. If this limitation were to continue significantly beyond three years, it could restrict our ability to lease additional U.S. federal lands and coal reserves critical to our Western U.S. Mining and Powder River Basin Mining segments.\nOur planned mine development projects and acquisition activities may not result in significant additional reserves, and we may not have success developing additional mines. Most of our mining operations are conducted on properties owned or leased by us. Our right to mine some of our reserves may be materially adversely affected if defects in title or boundaries exist. In order to conduct our mining operations on properties where these defects exist, we may incur unanticipated costs. In addition, in order to develop our reserves, we must also own the rights to the related surface property and receive various governmental permits. We cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the permits or appropriate land access necessary for us to operate profitably in the future. We may not be able to negotiate new leases from the government or from private parties, obtain mining contracts for properties containing additional reserves or maintain our leasehold interest in properties on which mining operations have not commenced or have not met minimum quantity or product royalty requirements. From time to time, we have experienced litigation with lessors of our coal properties and with royalty holders. In addition, from time to time, our permit applications and federal and state coal leases have been challenged, causing production delays.\nTo the extent that our existing sources of liquidity are not sufficient to fund our planned mine development projects and reserve acquisition activities, we may require access to capital markets, which may not be available to us or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. If we are unable to fund these activities, we may not be able to maintain or increase our existing production rates and we could be forced to change our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2016 Form 10-K\nOur global operations increase our exposure to risks unique to international mining and trading operations.\nOur international platform increases our exposure to country risks, international regulatory requirements and the effects of changes in currency exchange rates. Some of our international activities are in developing countries where the economic strength, business practices and counterparty reputations may not be as well developed as in our U.S. or Australian operations. We are exposed to various business and political risks, including political instability, heightened levels of corruption or fraud in certain markets, the potential for expropriation of assets, costs associated with the repatriation of earnings and the potential for unexpected changes in regulatory requirements. Despite our efforts to perform due diligence, screening, training and auditing of internal and external business agents, vendors, partners and customers to mitigate these risks, our results of operations, financial position or cash flow could be adversely affected by these activities.\nJoint ventures, partnerships or non-managed operations may not be successful and may not comply with our operating standards.\nWe participate in several joint venture and partnership arrangements and may enter into others, all of which necessarily involve risk. Whether or not we hold majority interests or maintain operational control in our joint ventures, our partners may, among other things, (1) have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with, or opposed to, ours; (2) seek to block actions that we believe are in our or the joint venture\u2019s best interests; or (3) be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture or other agreements, such as contributing capital, each of which may adversely impact our results of operations and our liquidity or impair our ability to recover our investments.\nWhere our joint ventures are jointly controlled or not managed by us, we may provide expertise and advice but have limited control over compliance with our operational standards. We also utilize contractors across our mining platform, and may be similarly limited in our ability to control their operational practices. Failure by non-controlled joint venture partners or contractors to adhere to operational standards that are equivalent to ours could unfavorably affect operating costs and productivity and adversely impact our results of operations and reputation.\nWe may undertake further repositioning plans that would require additional charges.\nAs a result of our continuing review of our business or changing demand, we may choose to further reduce our workforce in the future. These actions may result in further restructuring charges, cash expenditures and the consumption of management resources, any of which could cause our operating results to decline and may fail to yield the expected benefits.\nWe could be exposed to significant liability, reputational harm, loss of revenue, increased costs or other risks if we sustain cyber attacks or other security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us, our customers or other third-parties.\nWe have implemented security protocols and systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our operations and protecting our and our counterparties' confidential information and information related to identifiable individuals against unauthorized access. Despite such efforts, we may be subject to security breaches which could result in unauthorized access to our facilities or the information we are trying to protect. Unauthorized physical access to one of our facilities or electronic access to our information systems could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, litigation by affected parties, damage to sources of competitive advantage, disruptions to our operations, loss of customers, financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information and costs to remediate such security vulnerabilities, any of which could have a substantial impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur expenditures for postretirement benefit and pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect.\nWe provide postretirement health and life insurance benefits to eligible employees. Our total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation related to such benefits was a liability of $812.1 million as of December 31, 2016, of which $55.8 million was classified as a current liability. Certain of our U.S. subsidiaries also sponsor defined benefit pension plans. Net pension liabilities were $186.3 million as of December 31, 2016, of which none was classified a current liability.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2016 Form 10-K\nThese liabilities are actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate, future cost trends, and rates of return on plan assets to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. A decrease in the discount rate used to determine our postretirement benefit and defined benefit pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of these obligations, thereby increasing the cost in subsequent fiscal years. We have made assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes or changes in healthcare benefits provided by the government could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. Additionally, our reported defined benefit pension funding status may be affected, and we may be required to increase employer contributions, due to increases in our defined benefit pension obligation or poor financial performance in asset markets in future years.\nOur defined benefit pension plans are subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). It is implicit in our underlying assumptions that those plans continue to operate in the normal course of business. However, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) may terminate our plans under certain circumstances pursuant to ERISA, including in the event that the PBGC concludes that its risk may increase unreasonably if such plans continue to operate based on its assessment of the plans\u2019 funded status, our financial condition or other factors. Termination of the plans would require us to provide immediate funding or other financial assurance to the PBGC for all or a substantial portion of the underfunded amounts, as determined by the PBGC based on its own assumptions. Those assumptions may differ from our own. Any of those consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial conditions or available liquidity.\nConcerns about the environmental impacts of coal combustion, including perceived impacts on global climate issues, are resulting in increased regulation of coal combustion in many jurisdictions, unfavorable lending policies by government-backed lending institutions and development banks toward the financing of new overseas coal-fueled power plants and divestment efforts affecting the investment community, which could significantly affect demand for our products or our securities.\nGlobal climate issues continue to attract public and scientific attention. Numerous reports, such as the Fourth and the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have also engendered concern about the impacts of human activity, especially fossil fuel combustion, on global climate issues. In turn, increasing government attention is being paid to global climate issues and to emissions of what are commonly referred to as greenhouse gases, including emissions of carbon dioxide from coal combustion by power plants.\nEnactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the U.S., some of its states or other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources or coal-fueled power plant closures. Further, policies limiting available financing for the development of new coal-fueled power plants could adversely impact the global demand for coal. The potential financial impact on us of future laws, regulations or other policies will depend upon the degree to which any such laws or regulations force electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws, regulations or other policies, the time periods over which those laws, regulations or other policies would be phased in, the state of commercial development and deployment of CCUS technologies and the alternative markets for coal. From time to time, we attempt to analyze the potential impact on the Company of as-yet-unadopted potential laws, regulations and policies. Such analyses require that we make significant assumptions as to the specific provisions of such potential laws, regulations and policies. These analyses sometimes show that certain potential laws, regulations and policies, if implemented in the manner assumed by the analyses, could result in material adverse impacts on our operations, financial condition or cash flow, in view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these potential laws, regulations and policies. We do not believe that such analyses reasonably predict the quantitative impact that future laws, regulations or other policies may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThere have also been efforts in recent years affecting the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities and also pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. The impact of such efforts may adversely affect the demand for and price of securities issued by us and impact our access to the capital and financial markets.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2016 Form 10-K\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Expected Post-Emergence Capital Structure under the Plan\nIf the Plan becomes effective, our common stock will be extinguished, canceled and discharged on the Plan Effective Date.\nIf the Plan becomes effective, our common stock will be extinguished, canceled and discharged on the Plan Effective Date. Under the Plan, holders of our common stock are not entitled to receive, and will not receive or retain, any property or interest in property on account of such equity interests. In the event of cancellation of our common stock, amounts invested by the holders will not be recoverable and the common stock will have no value. Trading prices for Peabody Energy's equity or other securities prior to the Plan Effective Date may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by the holders thereof on the Plan Effective Date. Our common stock may continue to trade even though it will be extinguished, canceled and discharged on the Plan Effective Date if the Plan becomes effective. Accordingly, Peabody Energy urges caution with respect to existing and future investments in its equity or other securities.\nFollowing our expected emergence from our Chapter 11 Cases, we will continue to face a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business.\nFollowing our expected emergence from our Chapter 11 Cases, we will continue to face a number of risks, including certain risks that are beyond our control, such as deterioration or other changes in economic conditions, changes in the industry, changes in customer demand for, and acceptance of, our coal, and increasing expenses. As a result of these risks and others, there is no guarantee that the Plan will achieve our stated goals.\nFurthermore, even though our overall indebtedness will be reduced through the Plan, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our business after the Plan Effective Date. Adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms.\nFollowing our expected emergence from our Chapter 11 Cases, there will not be an established market for shares of Reorganized PEC Common Stock or our Preferred Equity, which means there are uncertainties regarding the prices and terms on which holders could dispose of their shares, if at all.\nNo established market exists for the new common stock (Reorganized PEC Common Stock) or the preferred stock (Preferred Equity) to be issued pursuant to the Plan. We will use our reasonable best efforts to cause the Reorganized PEC Common Stock and Preferred Equity to be listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as soon as practicable following the Plan Effective Date. However, the Company cannot give assurances as to whether the NYSE will approve the Reorganized PEC Common Stock or Preferred Equity for listing or when any such listing will occur. There can be no assurance that the Reorganized PEC Common Stock or Preferred Equity will be listed on the NYSE or any other national exchange or interdealer quotation system or that we will continue to meet the requirements for listing once a listing has been approved. If the Reorganized PEC Common Stock or Preferred Equity is not listed on a national exchange or interdealer quotation system, we intend to cooperate with any registered broker-dealer who may seek to initiate price quotations for the Reorganized PEC Common Stock or Preferred Equity in the over-the-counter market. Again, however, no assurance can be given that such securities will be quoted on the over-the-counter market. We, therefore, cannot provide any assurance that the Reorganized PEC Common Stock or Preferred Equity will be publicly tradable at any time after the Plan Effective Date. If no public market for the Reorganized PEC Common Stock or Preferred Equity develops, holders of such securities may have difficulty selling or obtaining timely and accurate quotations with respect to such securities.\nThere cannot be any assurance as to the degree of price volatility in any market that develops for the Reorganized PEC Common Stock or Preferred Equity. Some holders who receive Reorganized PEC Common Stock or Preferred Equity pursuant to the Plan may not elect to hold equity on a long-term basis. Sales by future stockholders of a substantial number of shares after the Plan Effective Date could significantly reduce the market price of the Reorganized PEC Common Stock or Preferred Equity. Moreover, the perception that these stockholders might sell significant amounts of the Reorganized PEC Common Stock or Preferred Equity could depress the trading price of the shares for a considerable period. Under the terms of a registration rights agreement contemplated by the Plan, we will be required to file a shelf registration statement that will permit certain holders of Reorganized PEC Common Stock and/or Preferred Equity acquiring shares in connection with the Plan to sell their shares in the public markets. Sales of the Reorganized PEC Common Stock or Preferred Equity, and the possibility thereof, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity, or equity-related securities, in the future at a time and price that we consider appropriate.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2016 Form 10-K\nReorganized PEC Common Stock will be subject to dilution and may be subject to further dilution in the future.\nReorganized PEC Common Stock to be issued on the Plan Effective Date is subject to dilution from the long-term incentive plan (LTIP) contemplated by the Plan, the Preferred Equity, payment-in-kind dividends to be paid to holders of Preferred Equity and certain warrants expected to be issued on the Plan Effective Date. In addition, in the future, we may issue equity securities in connection with future investments, acquisitions or capital raising transactions. Such issuances or grants could constitute a significant portion of the then-outstanding common stock, which may result in significant dilution in ownership of common stock, including shares of Reorganized PEC Common Stock issued pursuant to the Plan. In addition, holders of Reorganized PEC Common Stock will be subordinated to the Preferred Equity to the extent of the Preferred Equity's liquidation preference.\nFollowing our expected emergence from our Chapter 11 Cases, the potential payment of dividends on our stock or repurchases of our stock will be dependent on a number of factors, and future payments and repurchases cannot be assured.\nIt is uncertain whether we will pay cash dividends or other distributions with respect to our post-emergence stock in the foreseeable future. Restrictive covenants in certain debt instruments to which we or our subsidiaries will, or may, be a party, may limit our ability to pay dividends or for us to receive dividends from our subsidiaries, any of which may negatively impact the trading price of the Reorganized PEC Common Stock and Preferred Equity. In addition, holders of our post-emergence stock will only be entitled to receive such cash dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments, and our Board of Directors may only authorize us to repurchase shares of our post-emergence stock with funds legally available for such repurchases. The payment of future cash dividends and future repurchases will depend upon our earnings, economic conditions, liquidity and capital requirements, and other factors, including our debt leverage. In addition, the terms of the Preferred Equity will limit our ability to pay cash dividends on or purchase shares of Reorganized PEC Common Stock without the consent of holders representing at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Preferred Equity. Accordingly, we cannot make any assurance that future dividends will be paid or future repurchases will be made.\nFollowing our emergence from our Chapter 11 Cases under the Plan, we expect to have substantial indebtedness, and our financial performance could be adversely affected by our substantial indebtedness.\nOur financial performance could be affected by our substantial indebtedness. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $7.8 billion of indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis. Upon emergence from our Chapter 11 Cases under the Plan, we expect to have $1.95 billion of indebtedness outstanding, excluding capital leases, on a consolidated basis.\nThe degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to pay interest and satisfy our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nincreasing the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, business development or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, business development or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult to obtain surety bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other financing, particularly during periods in which credit markets are weak;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the coal industry;\n\u2022\ncausing a decline in our credit ratings; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors.\nIn addition, our future indebtedness under the Plan is expected to subject us to certain restrictive covenants. Failure by us to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us and result in amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable.\nAny downgrade in our credit ratings could result in, among other matters, additional required financial assurances related to our reclamation obligations, a requirement to post additional collateral on derivative trading instruments that we may enter into, the loss of trading counterparties for corporate hedging and trading and brokerage activities or an increase in the cost of, or a limit on our access to, various forms of credit used in operating our business.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2016 Form 10-K\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. Under the Plan, we expect our future indebtedness will restrict our ability to sell assets outside of the ordinary course of business and will restrict the use of the proceeds from any such sales. We may not be able to complete those sales or obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. In addition, the terms of our future indebtedness under the Plan provide that if we cannot meet our debt service obligations, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nDespite our and our subsidiaries\u2019 expected level of indebtedness following the Plan Effective Date, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt, including secured debt. This could further increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including additional secured debt. Although covenants under the indenture governing the senior secured notes to be outstanding following the Plan Effective Date (New Senior Secured Notes) and the agreements governing our other post-emergence indebtedness (Exit Financings) will limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions can be substantial. In addition, the indenture governing the New Senior Secured Notes and the agreements governing our other Exit Financings will not limit us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness as defined therein.\nAfter the Plan Effective Date, we expect that approximately $950.0 million will be outstanding under our new senior secured term loan facility (New Credit Facility) as of the Plan Effective Date. Additionally, prior to the final maturity date of our New Credit Facility, we may add one or more incremental term loan facilities or other first lien debt in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed (a) $300 million plus (b) an additional amount subject to compliance with a specified first lien leverage ratio, subject to certain other conditions.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our post-emergence indebtedness or other obligations.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or refinance our debt obligations, depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic, industry, and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory, and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nThe covenants in our indenture governing the New Senior Secured Notes and the agreements and instruments governing our other post-emergence indebtedness, including the other Exit Financings, impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe indenture governing the New Senior Secured Notes and the agreements and instruments governing our other post-emergence indebtedness, including the other Exit Financings, will contain certain restrictions and covenants which restrict our ability to incur liens and/or debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other person, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThese covenants restrict, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends on or make distributions in respect of stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions from certain subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nplace restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us.\nPeabody Energy Corporation\n2016 Form 10-K\nOur ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and we may need to refinance existing debt in the future. A breach of any of these covenants together with the expiration of any cure period, if applicable, could result in a default under the New Senior Secured Notes. If any such default occurs, subject to applicable grace periods, the holder of New Senior Secured Notes may elect to declare all outstanding New Senior Secured Notes, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. If the obligations under the New Senior Secured Notes were to be accelerated, our financial resources may be insufficient to repay the notes and any other indebtedness becoming due in full.\nIn addition, if we breach the covenants in the indentures governing the New Senior Secured Notes and do not cure such breach within the applicable time periods specified therein, we would cause an event of default under the indenture governing the New Senior Secured Notes and a cross-default to certain of our other Exit Financings and the lenders or holders thereunder could accelerate their obligations. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our indebtedness is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies who are not subject to such restrictions.\nOther Business Risks\nWe may not be able to fully utilize our deferred tax assets.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, most significantly Australia. As of December 31, 2016, we had gross deferred income tax assets and liabilities of $4,978.0 million and $1,114.4 million, respectively, as described further in Note 12. \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. At that date, we also had recorded a valuation allowance of $3,881.2 million, substantially comprised of a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset positions in the U.S. and Australia driven by recent cumulative book losses, as determined by considering all sources of available income (including items classified as discontinued operations or recorded directly to \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\"), which limited our ability to look to future taxable income in assessing the likelihood of realizing those assets.\nAlthough we may be able to utilize some or all of those deferred tax assets in the future if we have income of the appropriate character in those jurisdictions (subject to loss carryforward and tax credit expiry, in certain cases), there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. Further, we are presently unable to record tax benefits on future losses in the U.S. and Australia until such time as sufficient income is generated by our operations in those jurisdictions to support the realization of the related net deferred tax asset positions. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may adversely be affected in future periods by these limitations.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions that may discourage a takeover attempt.\nProvisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, as in effect now, and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our by-laws and certificate of incorporation impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. The certificate of incorporation and by-laws that will govern us following the Plan Effective Date are expected to include similar provisions.\nDiversity in interpretation and application of accounting literature in the mining industry may impact our reported financial results.\nThe mining industry has limited industry-specific accounting literature and, as a result, we understand diversity in practice exists in the interpretation and application of accounting literature to mining-specific issues. As diversity in mining industry accounting is addressed, we may need to restate our reported results if the resulting interpretations differ from our current accounting practices.
