{"cik": "316709", "company": "SCHWAB CHARLES CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nWe face a variety of risks that may affect our operations, financial results, or stock price and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. The following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant, although there may be other risks that could arise, or may prove to be more significant than expected, that may affect our operations or financial results.\nWe also face certain risks in connection with our proposed merger with TD Ameritrade as described above in Item 1 of this Form 10-K. We encourage you to consider the risks below under the caption \u201cRisks Related to the Proposed Merger with TD Ameritrade.\u201d These risks and other risks associated with the proposed merger will be more fully discussed in the joint proxy statement/prospectus that will be included in the registration statement on Form S-4 that CSC will file with the SEC in connection with the merger.\nFor a discussion of our risk management governance and processes, including operational risk, compliance risk, credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk, see Risk Management and Capital Management in Part II, Item 7.\n- 11 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nDevelopments in the business, economic, and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our business.\nOur business can be adversely affected by the general environment - economic, corporate, securities market, regulatory, and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations, trading activity, interest rates, and overall investor engagement, and are outside of our control. Deterioration in the housing and credit markets, reduction in short-term interest rates, and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact our results of operations and capital resources.\nExtensive regulation of our businesses may subject us to significant penalties or limitations on business activities.\nAs a participant in the securities, banking, and financial services industries, we are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws by governmental agencies, supervisory authorities and SROs. The costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase. These regulations affect our business operations and impose capital, client protection, and market conduct requirements on us.\nIn addition to specific banking laws and regulations, our banking regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could require CSC and/or our banking subsidiaries to hold more capital, increase liquidity, or limit their ability to pay dividends or CSC\u2019s ability to repurchase or redeem shares. The banking regulators could also limit our ability to grow, including adding assets, launching new products, making acquisitions, and undertaking strategic investments. Other potential regulatory actions include limiting our banking subsidiaries\u2019 ability to accept deposits swept from client brokerage accounts and brokered deposits and preventing us from pursuing our business strategy.\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements, there are a number of risks, particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance. Any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by our regulators against us or our affiliates, officers or employees could result in fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, enforcement actions, suspension, disqualification or expulsion, or other disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on our business activities, any of which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, violations could occur. In addition, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time. There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities. Such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with our regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities.\nLegislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect our business and financial results.\nNew legislation, rules, regulations and guidance, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal, state, foreign and SRO rules, regulations and guidance, including changes relating to mutual funds, broker-dealer fiduciary duties and regulatory treatment of deposit accounts, may directly affect the operation and profitability of Schwab or its specific business lines. Our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing taxation, electronic commerce, client privacy and security of client data. In addition, the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct, modifications to our business practices, more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs and could limit our ability to return capital to stockholders. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance, risk management, treasury and operations functions.\nFailure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect our financial condition.\nCSC, together with its banking and broker-dealer subsidiaries, must meet certain capital and liquidity standards, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of Schwab\u2019s capital and Schwab\u2019s internal assessment of its capital needs. The Uniform Net Capital Rule limits CS&Co\u2019s ability to transfer capital to CSC and other affiliates. New regulatory capital, liquidity, and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including paying dividends, stock repurchases, and redemptions, and may require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity or to limit our\n- 12 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\ngrowth. Failure by either CSC or its banking subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a negative impact on us. In addition, failure by CSC or our banking subsidiaries to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy their capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as Tier 1 Capital, or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity, could require us to liquidate assets, deleverage or otherwise change our business and/or investment plans, which may adversely affect our financial results. Issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders.\nEffective December 31, 2019, CSC was assigned to Category III of the new tailored regulatory requirements. The Federal Reserve indicated that large savings and loan holding companies, including CSC, will become subject to the CCAR process. If CSC reaches $700 billion in total assets or $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activity, CSC will become subject to more stringent Category II requirements, including annual stress testing, the advanced approaches framework, the inability to opt out of including AOCI in regulatory capital calculations, the full LCR rule and daily liquidity reporting. CSC will also be subject to the full LCR rule and daily liquidity reporting if its weighted short-term wholesale funding is $75 billion or more.\nA significant change in client cash allocations could negatively impact our net interest revenue.\nWe rely heavily on bank deposits as a funding source to extend loans to clients and purchase investment securities. Our bank deposits are primarily driven by our bank sweep feature when cash awaiting investment in our client brokerage accounts is swept to our banking subsidiaries. A significant reduction in our clients\u2019 allocation to cash, a change in the allocation of that cash, or a transfer of cash away from the Company, could reduce net interest revenue.\nSignificant interest rate changes could affect our profitability.\nThe direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. A decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on our net interest revenue. A low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on our asset management and administration fee revenues if we have to waive a portion of our management fees for certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients.\nAlthough we believe we are positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment, a rise in interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment induces us to raise our interest rates to avoid losing deposits, or replace deposits with higher cost funding sources without offsetting increases in yields on interest-earning assets can reduce our net interest revenue.\nThe expected phase-out of LIBOR could negatively impact our net interest revenue and require significant operational work.\nCertain securities in our investment portfolio and the floating rate loans we offer reference LIBOR as the benchmark rate to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount. We also use LIBOR in many of our financial models, such as those used for capital stress testing, and to determine the dividend rates for certain of our series of preferred stock which begin to float in 2022 and later. If LIBOR is discontinued after 2021 as expected, there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments and there will be significant work required to transition to using the new benchmark rates and implement necessary changes to our systems and financial models. This could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions and may impact our existing transaction data, products, systems, operations, and pricing processes. The calculation of interest rates under the replacement benchmarks could also impact our net interest revenue. In addition, LIBOR may perform differently during the phase-out period than in the past which could result in lower interest payments and a reduction in the value of certain securities in our investment portfolio.\nSecurity breaches of our systems, or those of our clients or third parties, may subject us to significant liability and damage Schwab\u2019s reputation.\nOur business involves the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential information about our clients and us. Information security risks for financial institutions are increasing, in part because of the use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, activists, hackers and other external parties, including foreign state actors. Our systems and those of other financial institutions have\n- 13 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nbeen and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, for example, employee misconduct.\nGiven the high volume of transactions that we process, the large number of clients, counterparties and third-party service providers with which we do business and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected. The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation is completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.\nSecurity breaches, including breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers or clients, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject us to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance, actions by our regulators, damage to Schwab\u2019s reputation, or a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures.\nWe also face risk related to external fraud involving the misappropriation and use of clients\u2019 user names, passwords or other personal information to gain access to clients\u2019 financial accounts at Schwab. This could occur from the compromise of clients\u2019 personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company where clients\u2019 personal information is taken and then made available to fraudsters. Such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. Losses reimbursed to clients under our guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTechnology and operational failures or errors could subject us to losses, litigation, regulatory actions, and reputational damage.\nWe must process, record and monitor a large number of transactions and our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems. System interruptions, errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to our systems, linkages with third-party systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on our business and operations. Our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, execution errors, errors in models such as those used for asset management, capital planning and management, risk management, stress testing and compliance, employee misconduct, unauthorized trading, external fraud, computer viruses, distributed denial of service attacks, cyber attacks, terrorist attacks, natural disaster, power outage, capacity constraints, software flaws, events impacting key business partners and vendors, and similar events. For example, Schwab and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have, in certain circumstances, made websites, mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time. It could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to our technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence, which could affect our ability to process and settle client transactions. Moreover, instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact Schwab\u2019s reputation and client confidence in the Company, in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer unexpected losses, reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors, including those of our vendors or other third parties.\nWhile we devote substantial attention and resources to the reliability, capacity and scalability of our systems, extraordinary trading volumes could cause our computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail, affecting our ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients\u2019 orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate. Disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses and decreased client satisfaction. We are also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges, clearing houses and other\n- 14 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nintermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement. System failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices, cause substantial losses for us and for our clients, and subject us to claims from our clients for damages.\nOur investment management operations may subject us to fiduciary or other legal liability for client losses.\nFund and trust management and administration are complex activities and include functions such as recordkeeping and accounting, security pricing, corporate actions, compliance with investment restrictions, daily net asset value computations, account reconciliations, and required distributions to fund shareholders. Failure to properly perform operational tasks, or the misrepresentation of our services and products could subject us to regulatory sanctions, penalties or litigation and result in reputational damage, liability to clients, and the termination of investment management or administration agreements and the withdrawal of assets under our management.\nIn the management and administration of funds and client accounts, we use quantitative models and other tools and resources to support investment decisions and processes, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Errors in the design, function, or underlying assumptions used in these models and tools, particularly if we fail to detect the errors over an extended period, could subject us to claims of a breach of fiduciary duty and potentially large liabilities for make-whole payments, litigation, and/or regulatory fines.\nA significant decrease in our liquidity could negatively affect our business as well as reduce client confidence in Schwab.\nMaintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our business operations, including transaction settlement, custody requirements, and lending commitments, among other liquidity needs. We meet our liquidity needs primarily from working capital and cash generated by client activity, as well as external financing. Fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances, as well as market conditions or changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits, may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs. A reduction in our liquidity position could reduce client confidence in Schwab, which could result in the transfer of client assets and accounts, or could cause us to fail to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including the LCR. In addition, if our broker-dealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines, regulators could limit the subsidiaries\u2019 operations or their ability to upstream funds to CSC, which could reduce CSC\u2019s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt, pay dividends on CSC\u2019s preferred stock, or return capital to common stockholders. In addition, CSC may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries.\nFactors which may adversely affect our liquidity position include CS&Co having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances, fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts, a dramatic increase in our lending activities (including margin, mortgage-related, and personal lending), increased capital requirements, changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations, other regulatory changes, or a loss of market or client confidence in Schwab resulting in unanticipated withdrawals of client funds.\nWhen available cash is not sufficient for our liquidity needs, we may seek external financing. During periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets, potential sources of external financing could be reduced, and borrowing costs could increase. Although CSC and CS&Co maintain committed and uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines and CSC has a commercial paper issuance program, as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC which can be used to sell securities, financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets. In addition, a significant downgrade in the Company\u2019s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets.\nWe may suffer significant losses from our credit exposures.\nOur businesses are subject to the risk that a client, counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations, or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate. While we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk, the policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Our exposure mainly results from margin lending, clients\u2019 options and futures trading, securities lending, mortgage lending, pledged asset lending, our role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds we sponsor.\n- 15 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nWhen clients purchase securities on margin, borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities, or trade options or futures, we are subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients\u2019 indebtedness. Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses.\nWe have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments. Those investments are subject to price fluctuations. Loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such loss of value has resulted from a credit loss. The evaluation of whether a credit loss exists is a matter of judgment, which includes the assessment of multiple factors. If management determines that a security\u2019s decline in fair value is the result of a credit loss, an allowance for credit losses on the security will be recorded and a corresponding loss will be recognized in current earnings. Even if a decline in fair value of a security is not determined to have resulted from a credit loss, if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs, we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time.\nOur bank loans primarily consist of First Mortgages, HELOCs, and PALs. Increases in delinquency and default rates, housing and stock price declines, increases in the unemployment rate, and other economic factors can result in increases in allowances for credit losses and related credit loss expense, as well as write downs on such loans.\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d, which requires estimation of expected lifetime credit losses, rather than incurred losses only, as was previously required. For more information on this adoption, see Part II - Item 8 - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2.\nHeightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss. Examples include:\n\u2022\nLarge positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry;\n\u2022\nMortgage loans and HELOCs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region; and\n\u2022\nClient margins, options or futures, pledged assets, and securities lending activities collateralized by or linked to securities of a single issuer, index, or industry.\nWe sponsor a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds. Although we have no obligation to do so, we may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit, liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity. Such support could cause us to take significant charges, could reduce our liquidity and, in certain situations, could, with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds, result in us having to consolidate one or more funds in our financial statements. If we choose not to provide credit, liquidity or other support in such a situation, Schwab could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending against claims or proceedings.\nThe financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks. We are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. We are also the subject of inquiries, investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies.\nLitigation and arbitration claims include those brought by our clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied at Schwab. Claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors\u2019 misconduct. Litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights (e.g., patents). Such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources. If we were found to have infringed on a third-party patent, or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial damages, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology, or providing certain products or services.\nActions brought against us may result in settlements, awards, injunctions, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, including reputational harm. Even if we are successful in defending against these actions, the defense of such matters may\n- 16 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nresult in us incurring significant expenses. A substantial judgment, settlement, fine, or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular future period, depending on our results for that period. In market downturns and periods of heightened volatility, the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased.\nWe rely on outsourced service providers to perform key functions.\nWe rely on external service providers to perform certain key technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. These service providers face technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause us to incur losses and could harm Schwab\u2019s reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures, capacity constraints, financial difficulties or for any other reason, and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in financial losses to us. Switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations.\nPotential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on our financial position.\nWe evaluate potential strategic transactions, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions. Any such transaction could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The process of evaluating, negotiating, and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and might cause the loss of key clients, employees, and business partners. Moreover, integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate operational, financial, and management information systems and management controls, integrate relationships with clients and business partners, and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas. In addition, an acquisition may cause us to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings. Further, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition (including without limitation the pending acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and assets of USAA-IMCO), and any future acquisition could be dilutive to our current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership or to earnings per common share (EPS).\nOur acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business, operations or financial condition of the entity being acquired or sold. To the extent we enter into an agreement to buy or sell an entity, there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected, or at all. If a material transaction does not close, our stock price could decline.\nOur industry is highly competitive and characterized by aggressive price competition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment with a broad array of competitors from large integrated banks to venture-capital backed private companies. We continually monitor our pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjust interest rates on deposits and loans, fees for advisory services, expense ratios on mutual funds and ETFs, trade commission rates, and other pricing and incentives to sustain our competitive position. Increased price competition from other financial services firms to attract clients, such as reduced commissions, higher deposit rates, reduced mutual fund or ETF expense ratios, or the increased use of incentives, could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees.\nThe market for qualified personnel in our business is highly competitive. At various times, different functions and roles are in especially high demand in the market, compelling us to pay more to attract talent. Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs.\n- 17 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nOur stock price has fluctuated historically, and may continue to fluctuate.\nOur stock price can be volatile. Among the factors that may affect the volatility of our stock price are the following:\n\u2022\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates;\n\u2022\nSpeculation in the investment community or the press about, or actual changes in, our competitive position, organizational structure, executive team, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, expense discipline, or strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nThe announcement of new products, services, acquisitions, or dispositions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nIncreases or decreases in revenue or earnings, changes in earnings estimates by the investment community, and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results; and\n\u2022\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by large stockholders.\nChanges in the stock market generally, or as it concerns our industry, as well as geopolitical, corporate, regulatory, business, and economic factors may also affect our stock price.\nFuture sales of CSC\u2019s equity securities may adversely affect the market price of CSC\u2019s common stock and result in dilution.\nCSC\u2019s certificate of incorporation authorizes CSC\u2019s Board of Directors, among other things, to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities, without stockholder approval.\nCSC may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes. The issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of CSC\u2019s common stock and may adversely affect the market price of CSC\u2019s common stock.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger with TD Ameritrade\nCompletion of the merger is subject to many conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the merger will not be completed.\nThe obligations of CSC and TD Ameritrade to complete the merger are subject to satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver) of a number of conditions, including, among others:\n\u2022\nthe affirmative vote of (A) the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of TD Ameritrade common stock approving and adopting the Merger Agreement and (B) the holders (other than TD Bank, the Significant TD Ameritrade Stockholders and their respective affiliates) of a majority of the outstanding shares of TD Ameritrade common stock (other than shares of TD Ameritrade common stock held by TD Bank, the Significant TD Ameritrade Stockholders and their respective affiliates) approving and adopting the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022\nthe affirmative vote of (A) a majority of the votes cast by holders of outstanding shares of Schwab common stock approving the share issuance and (B) the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Schwab common stock approving the Schwab charter amendment;\n\u2022\nexpiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) under the HSR Act and certain governmental authorizations having been made or obtained and being in full force and effect;\n\u2022\nreceipt of noncontrol determinations from the Federal Reserve;\n\u2022\naccuracy of the representations and warranties made in the Merger Agreement by the other party, subject to certain materiality thresholds;\n\u2022\nperformance in all material respects by the other party of the obligations required to be performed by it at or prior to completion of the merger; and\n\u2022\nthe absence since the date of the Merger Agreement of a material adverse effect on the other party.\nThere can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the merger will be satisfied or waived in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the merger may not be completed. If the merger is not completed for any reason, the ongoing business of CSC may be adversely affected and, without realizing the benefits of having completed the merger, we would be subject to a number of risks, including that we may receive negative reactions from our stockholders, employees, customers and regulators, and that the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed.\n- 18 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nAs a condition to authorization of the merger, governmental authorities may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after completion of the merger. Such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could, among other things, have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger, or otherwise adversely affecting our businesses and results of operations after completion of the merger.\nAlso, if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $950 million to TD Ameritrade and we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement.\nIn addition, the Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our businesses prior to completion of the merger, and such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to consent of TD Ameritrade, could prevent us from making certain acquisitions, taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the merger that we would have made, taken or pursued if these restrictions were not in place.\nCSC and TD Ameritrade may also be subject to lawsuits challenging the merger, and adverse rulings in these lawsuits may delay or prevent the merger from being completed or require CSC or TD Ameritrade to incur significant costs to defend or settle these lawsuits.\nIf any of these risks materialize, they may materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, financial results, ratings, and/or stock price.\nSchwab\u2019s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the merger.\nParties with which we do business may experience uncertainty associated with the merger, including with respect to current or future business relationships with Schwab or the combined business. Schwab\u2019s business relationships may be subject to disruption as parties with which Schwab does business may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than Schwab or the combined business. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of the combined business, including an adverse effect on Schwab\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger. The risk, and adverse effect, of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nAfter completion of the merger, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger, which could adversely affect the value of our stock.\nThe success of the merger will depend, in significant part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses of Schwab and TD Ameritrade. Our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain risks. If Schwab is not able to successfully combine the businesses of Schwab and TD Ameritrade within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined business may not perform as expected and the value of Schwab common stock may be adversely affected.\nSchwab and TD Ameritrade have operated and, until completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently, and there can be no assurances that their businesses can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key Schwab or TD Ameritrade employees, the loss of clients, the disruption of either company\u2019s or both companies\u2019 ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated.\nIn addition, at times the attention of certain members of either company\u2019s or both companies\u2019 management and resources may be focused on completion of the merger and the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt each company\u2019s ongoing business and the business of the combined company.\nSchwab will incur significant transaction and merger-related costs in connection with the merger.\nWe expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the merger and combining the operations of the two\n- 19 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\ncompanies. Some of these costs have already been incurred or may be incurred regardless of whether the merger is completed. Schwab also will incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans with respect to the two companies, including facilities and systems consolidation costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the merger and the integration of the two companies\u2019 businesses. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nSchwab and TD Ameritrade may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other employees in light of the merger.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on Schwab and TD Ameritrade employees may impair Schwab\u2019s and TD Ameritrade\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel prior to and following the merger. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger, as employees of Schwab and TD Ameritrade may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined business. In addition, pursuant to change-in-control provisions in their respective employment agreements or term sheets with TD Ameritrade, certain employees of TD Ameritrade are entitled to receive severance payments upon a constructive termination of employment. Such TD Ameritrade employees potentially could terminate their employment following specified circumstances set forth in their employment agreements or term sheets, including certain changes in such employees\u2019 position, compensation or benefits and collect severance. Such circumstances could occur in connection with the merger as a result of changes in roles and responsibilities. If employees of Schwab or TD Ameritrade depart, the integration of the companies may be more difficult and the combined business following the merger may be harmed. Furthermore, Schwab may have to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the businesses of Schwab or TD Ameritrade, and Schwab\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger may be adversely affected. In addition, there could be disruptions to or distractions for the workforce and management associated with integrating employees into Schwab.\nThe merger may not be accretive to Schwab\u2019s earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of Schwab common stock following completion of the merger.\nIn connection with the completion of the merger, Schwab expects to issue approximately 586 million Schwab common shares. The issuance of new Schwab common shares could have the effect of depressing the market price of Schwab common shares.\nBased on the anticipated synergies between Schwab and TD Ameritrade, the merger is expected to be accretive to Schwab\u2019s earnings per share in the third year following completion of the merger. However, future events and conditions could reduce or delay the accretion that is currently projected or result in the merger being dilutive to Schwab\u2019s earnings per share, including adverse changes in market conditions, additional transaction and integration related costs and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the benefits anticipated in the merger. Any dilution of, reduction in, or delay of any accretion to, Schwab\u2019s earnings per share could cause the price of shares of Schwab common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate.\nIf our pending merger with TD Ameritrade is completed, our stockholders\u2019 ownership percentage will be diluted.\nIf the proposed merger is completed, we will issue to TD Ameritrade stockholders shares of our common stock. As a result of the issuance of these shares of our common stock, our stockholders will own a smaller percentage of the combined company after the merger and will therefore have a reduced voting interest. In addition, TD Bank will become our largest stockholder.", "PERMNO": 75186, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "SCHW"}
