{"cik": "1137091", "company": "POWER SOLUTIONS INTERNATIONAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe Company\u2019s business and results of operations are subject to various risks, including those listed below, many of which are not within the Company\u2019s control, which may cause actual financial performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. New risks may emerge at any time, and the Company cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect its results of operations.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows have been and will continue to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and future periods may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or other outbreaks of infectious diseases or similar public health threats and the resulting economic impact.\nAny outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments could have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the implementation of significant governmental measures to control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, travel restrictions, business shutdowns and restrictions on the movement of people in the United States and abroad. As discussed in Item 1. Business, these factors have impacted and will continue to impact the Company\u2019s operations, financial condition and demand for the Company\u2019s goods and services. Depending on the severity and longevity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company\u2019s business, employees, customers, suppliers and stockholders may continue to experience significant negative impacts for future periods. In addition, due to the nature with which the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, there is significant uncertainty around its ultimate impact on public health, business operations and the overall economy; therefore, the negative impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but the impact may continue to be material in the future.\nIn April 2020, the Company implemented contingency actions as a result of the expected significant negative impacts of these factors. The Company\u2019s temporary cost reduction measures included, among others, reduced hours of operations of the\nCompany\u2019s production facilities; reduced pay for salaried employees between 10% and 30%, depending on the employee\u2019s position; suspended the Company\u2019s 401(k) plan match; deferred spending on certain R&D programs; and minimized discretionary expenses and consulting services.\nThe measures with regard to pay for salaried employees and the suspension of the Company\u2019s 401 (k) plan match were in effect through December 31, 2020. Any additional cost savings initiatives or other cash actions the Company undertakes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may not achieve the intended results and may result in other adverse impacts, which could be material.\nThe degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the Company\u2019s financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations depends upon future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration, location, and spread of the outbreak, its severity, government and business measures to contain the virus and address its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. The Company cannot, at this time, predict the many potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nLiquidity and Indebtedness\nThe Company\u2019s management has concluded as of the filing of this 2021 Annual Report that, due to uncertainty surrounding the Company\u2019s ability to extend or refinance its current debt agreements and uncertainty as to whether it will have sufficient liquidity to fund its business activities, substantial doubt exists as to its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company\u2019s plans to alleviate the substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern may not be successful, and it may be forced to limit its business activities or be unable to continue as a going concern, which would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $180.9 million of total borrowings outstanding under its debt arrangements with Standard Chartered Bank (\u201cStandard Chartered\u201d) and Weichai. On March 25, 2022, the Company amended and restated its $130.0 million uncommitted senior secured revolving credit agreement with Standard Chartered (the \u201cSecond Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement\u201d), which extends the maturity date of loans outstanding under its previous credit facility to the earlier of March 24, 2023 or the demand of Standard Chartered. The $130.0 million Second Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement is subject to customary events of default and covenants and is secured by substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. In addition, Standard Chartered has the right to demand payment of any and all outstanding borrowings and other amounts outstanding at any point in time at its discretion. In connection with this Second Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement, on March 25, 2022, the Company also amended two of the three shareholder\u2019s loan agreements with Weichai, to among other things, extend the maturities thereof. The amended first shareholder\u2019s loan agreement continues to provide the Company with a $130.0 million subordinated loan under which Weichai is obligated to advance funds solely for purposes of repaying outstanding borrowings under the $130.0 million Second Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement if the Company is unable to pay such borrowings. The amended second shareholder\u2019s loan agreement continues to provide the Company with a $25.0 million subordinated loan at the discretion of Weichai. The maturity of the amended first shareholder\u2019s loan agreement was extended to April 24, 2023 and the maturity of the amended second shareholder\u2019s loan agreement was extended to May 20, 2023. The Company is also party to a third shareholder\u2019s loan agreement with Weichai, which was entered into on December 10, 2021, and matures on November 30, 2022. The third shareholders loan agreement provides the Company with access to up to $50.0 million of credit at the discretion of Weichai. All of the shareholder loan agreements with Weichai are subject to customary events of default and covenants. The Company has covenanted to secure any amounts borrowed under either of the agreements upon payment in full of all amounts outstanding under the $130.0 million Second Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement.\nDue to the above maturity dates of existing debt, which range from November 30, 2022 to May 20, 2023, the Company will need to extend and amend or refinance these loans on or before the expiration dates.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on generating profitable operating results, having sufficient liquidity, maintaining compliance with the covenants and other requirements under the various debt agreements, and extending and amending, refinancing or repaying the indebtedness outstanding under the Company\u2019s debt agreements.\nThere can be no assurance that it will be able to complete a financing on acceptable terms or repay this outstanding indebtedness, when required or if at all. Further, since certain of the Company\u2019s loans are uncommitted or at the discretion of the lender, there can be no assurance that any available credit will be extended. If the Company does not have sufficient liquidity to fund its business activities, it may be forced to limit its business activities or be unable to continue as a going concern, which would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.\nFurthermore, if the Company cannot raise capital on acceptable terms, it may not, among other things, be able to do the following:\n\u2022continue to expand the Company\u2019s research and product investments and sales and marketing organization;\n\u2022expand operations both organically and through acquisitions; and\n\u2022respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.\nThe Company has a significant amount of indebtedness and is highly leveraged. Its existing debt or any potential new debt could adversely affect its business and growth prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s total debt obligations, including indebtedness under agreements with Standard Chartered and Weichai, was $180.9 million. The Company\u2019s debt arrangements contain and may contain in the future certain requirements, including specific financial and other covenants or restrictions. The failure or the inability to meet such obligations under existing debt or any new debt could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial condition. In addition, the Company\u2019s debt obligations could make it more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions and could limit its flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and the industries in which it operates. The Company\u2019s indebtedness and the cash flow needed to satisfy its debt obligations and the covenants contained in current and potential future debt agreements could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022limiting funds available for borrowing through the imposition of availability blocks;\n\u2022limiting funds otherwise available for financing capital expenditures by requiring dedication of a portion of cash flows from operating activities to the repayment of debt and the interest on such debt;\n\u2022limiting the ability to incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022limiting the ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities, including mergers, acquisitions and other strategic transactions;\n\u2022making the Company more vulnerable to rising interest rates or higher interest rates; and\n\u2022making the Company more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business.\nThe Company\u2019s Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement places limitations on its ability to make acquisitions and restricts its ability to incur additional indebtedness, while certain loan agreements with Weichai place limitations or restrictions on the Company\u2019s usage of borrowed funds. Any future failure by the Company to comply with the financial covenants set forth under the Company\u2019s debt agreements, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of debt maturities or prevent the Company from accessing availability. If the maturity of the indebtedness is accelerated, the Company may not have sufficient cash resources, or have the ability to obtain financing through alternative resources, to satisfy its debt and other obligations, and the Company may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nLitigation and Internal Control Remediation\nThe Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting that have not been fully remediated. If its remediation measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if the Company otherwise fails to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, it may not be able to accurately report financial results, timely file periodic reports, maintain its reporting status or prevent fraud.\nIn connection with the Company\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, the Company concluded that there were material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. See Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, included in Part II, for additional information regarding these matters.\nThe Company\u2019s management may identify other material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting in the future. The existence of internal control material weaknesses could harm its business, the market price of its Common Stock and its ability to retain the Company\u2019s current, or obtain new, lenders, suppliers, key employees, alliance and strategic partners or require the implementation of certain undertakings with the SEC. In addition, the existence of material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting may affect its ability to timely file periodic reports under the Exchange Act. The inability to timely file periodic reports could result in the SEC revoking the registration of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, which would negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to re-list its Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market or any other stock exchange.\nThe Company has incurred significant costs in connection with the restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements and its failure to timely file prior periodic reports and will continue to incur significant costs to remediate material weaknesses in internal control.\nThe Company has incurred significant expenses, including audit, legal, consulting and other professional fees, and lender and noteholder consent fees, related to the restatement of its previously issued consolidated financial statements and the ongoing remediation of material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur certain of these expenses in the future. The Company has taken a number of actions, including adding significant internal resources and implementing a number of additional procedures and controls, in order to strengthen its accounting function and reduce the risk of future material misstatements in its financial statements. In addition, in September 2020, the Company settled the investigations by the SEC and USAO into the Company\u2019s past revenue recognition practices. As part of the settlement, among other undertakings, the Company committed to remediate the deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting that constituted material weaknesses as identified in Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures by April 30, 2021. On April 12, 2021 the SEC granted the Company\u2019s request for an extension of time until March 31, 2022 in which to comply with the requirements of the administrative order to remediate the remaining material weaknesses. Due to the progress achieved in remediating the material weaknesses as noted in Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting below, the Company formally requested an additional extension from the SEC to remediate the three remaining material weaknesses below. To the extent that the Company\u2019s request for an extension from the SEC, or other actions are not successful and completed in accordance with the provisions of the settlement with the SEC and USAO, the Company may be required to incur additional time and expense towards further remediation efforts and incremental substantive procedures, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. In addition, failure to comply with the provisions of the settlement agreements with the SEC and USAO could result in further actions by one or both governmental agencies which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nLimitations of the Company\u2019s Directors\u2019 and Officers\u2019 liability insurance and potential indemnification obligations will have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnder its bylaws and certain indemnification agreements, the Company has obligations to indemnify current and former officers and directors and certain current and former employees. Based on cumulative legal fees and settlements incurred, the Company fully exhausted its primary directors and officers insurance coverage of $30.0 million during the first quarter of 2021. Further, during 2021 the Company also exhausted most of its primary $10 million side A insurance coverage. Additional expenses currently expected to be incurred and that may occur in the future and/or liabilities that may be imposed in connection with actions against certain of the Company\u2019s past and present directors and officers and certain current and former employees who are entitled to indemnification will be funded by the Company with its existing cash resources. Since exhausting its primary directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance coverage in early 2021, the Company has incurred $22.8 million related to its indemnification obligation in 2021 and 2020 combined. Such expenses could continue to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In June 2020, the Company entered into a new directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policy, which was renewed in June 2021. The insurance policy includes standard exclusions including for any ongoing or pending litigation such as the disclosed investigations by the SEC and USAO.\nFinancial Condition, Results of Operations, and Cash Flows\nThe Company has experienced substantial net losses in recent fiscal years and may continue to experience net losses.\nThe Company generated a net loss in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 and has an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2021. The net loss experienced in 2021 was principally attributable to reduced gross profit as a result of higher material, tariff and freight costs (which were not fully recovered through pricing), significant warranty expenses (mostly related to certain engines sold into the transportation end market), and unfavorable product mix. In addition, the Company incurred significant legal and professional expenses associated with indemnifications of certain former employees of the Company. Some of these costs could remain in future periods. Continued losses could reduce cash available from operations to service or refinance the Company\u2019s indebtedness as necessary, as well as limit the Company\u2019s ability to finance future growth in its business and implement its strategies.\nThe Company could incur restructuring and impairment charges as it evaluates its portfolio of assets and identifies opportunities to restructure its business to optimize its cost structure.\nThe Company continuously evaluates its portfolio of assets and its operational structure in an effort to identify opportunities to optimize its cost structure including as a result of its business needs, the COVID-19 pandemic and its high warranty costs. These actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to asset impairments and employee termination costs, any of which could be significant and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company has substantial amounts of long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, which are subject to periodic impairment analysis and review. Identifying and assessing whether impairment indicators exist, or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating results, competition and general economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, requires significant judgment. Declines in profitability due to changes in volume, market pricing, cost or the business environment could result in charges that could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to price increases in some of the key components in its power systems.\nThe prices of some of the key components of the Company\u2019s power systems are subject to fluctuation due to market forces, including changes in the costs of raw materials incorporated into these components. Such price increases, which were substantial in 2021, occur from time to time due to spot shortages of commodities, increases in labor costs or longer-term shortages due to market forces. In particular, the prices of certain precious metals, such as palladium and rhodium, used in emissions-control systems fluctuate frequently and often significantly. Substantial increases in the prices of raw materials used in components that the Company sources from suppliers may result in increased prices charged by suppliers. If the Company incurs price increases from suppliers for key components in its power systems, production costs will increase, and given competitive market conditions, or contractual limitations, the Company may not be able to pass all or any of those cost increases on to OEM customers in the form of higher sales prices. To the extent that its competitors do not suffer comparable component cost increases, the Company may have even greater difficulty passing along price increases, and the Company\u2019s competitive position may be harmed. As a result, increases in costs of key components may adversely affect the Company\u2019s margins and otherwise adversely affect its results of operations, as was experienced during 2021.\nMany of the Company\u2019s power systems involve long and variable design and sales cycles.\nThe design and sales cycle for customized power systems, from initial contact with potential OEM customers to the commencement of shipments, may be lengthy. Customers generally consider a wide range of solutions before making a decision to purchase power systems. Before an OEM commits to purchase power systems, they often require a significant technical review, assessment of competitive products and approval at a number of management levels within their organization. During the time the Company\u2019s customers are evaluating its products, the Company may incur substantial sales and marketing, engineering, and research and development expenses to customize the power systems to the customer\u2019s needs.\nWarranty, Safety Standards, and Emissions\nThe Company could suffer warranty claims or be subject to product liability claims, both of which could materially adversely affect its business.\nThe Company\u2019s power systems are sophisticated and complex, and the success of the power systems is dependent, in part, upon the quality and performance of key components, such as engines, fuel systems, generators, breakers, and complex electrical components and associated software. The Company may incur liabilities for warranty claims as a result of defective products or components, including claims arising from defective products or components provided by its suppliers that are integrated into its power systems.\nThe provisions the Company makes for warranty accrual may not be sufficient, or it may be unable to rely on a warranty provided by a third-party manufacturer or recover costs incurred associated with defective components or products provided by its suppliers. The Company may recognize additional expenses as a result of warranty claims in excess of its current expectations. Such warranty claims may necessitate a redesign, re-specification, a change in manufacturing processes and/or a recall of its power systems, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations and on existing or future sales of its power systems and other products. Even in the absence of any warranty claims, a product deficiency such as a manufacturing defect or a safety issue may necessitate a product recall, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations and on existing or future sales.\nThe Company is exposed to potential product liability claims that are inherent to natural gas, propane, gasoline and diesel and products that use these fuels. Natural gas, propane, diesel and gasoline are flammable and are potentially dangerous products. Any accidents involving the Company\u2019s power systems could materially impede widespread market acceptance and demand for its power systems. In addition, the Company may be subject to a claim by end-users of its OEM customers\u2019 products or others alleging that they have suffered property damage, personal injury or death because its power systems or the products of its customers into which its power systems are integrated did not perform adequately. Such a claim could be made whether or not the Company\u2019s power systems perform adequately under the circumstances. From time to time, the Company may be subject to product liability claims in the ordinary course of business, and it carries a limited amount of product liability insurance for this purpose. However, current insurance policies may not provide sufficient or any coverage for such claims, and the Company cannot predict whether it will be able to maintain insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms.\nThe Company and its products are subject to numerous environmental and regulatory policies, including emission and fuel economy rules.\nThe Company\u2019s business is affected by government environmental policies, mandates and regulations around the world, most significantly with respect to emission standards in the United States. Examples of such regulations include those that (i) restrict the sale of power systems that do not meet emission standards and (ii) impose penalties on sellers of noncompliant power systems.\nThe Company generally must obtain product certification from both the EPA and the CARB to sell its products in the United States. The Company may attempt to expand sales of its certified power systems to OEMs that sell their products in other countries, which may also have stringent emissions requirements. Accordingly, future sales of the Company\u2019s products will depend upon its products being certified to meet the existing and future air quality and energy standards imposed by the relevant regulatory agencies. While the Company incurs significant research and development costs to ensure that its products comply with emission standards and meet certification requirements in the regions in which its products are sold, the Company cannot provide assurance that its products will continue to meet those standards. The failure to comply with certification requirements would not only adversely affect future sales but could result in the recall of products or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe adoption of new, more stringent and burdensome government emissions regulations, whether at the foreign, federal, state or local level, in markets in which the Company supplies power systems may require modification of emission certification and other manufacturing processes for its power systems. The Company might incur additional and/or unanticipated expenses in meeting future compliance requirements, and it may be required to increase its research and product development expenditures. Increases in such costs and expenses could necessitate increases in the prices the Company charges for its power systems, which could adversely affect demand for such power systems. There are no assurances that the Company will have adequate financial or technical resources in the future to maintain compliance with government emissions standards.\nHistorically, the Company\u2019s 6.0L and 8.8L gasoline engines qualified for the small manufacturer exemption for Phase 1 GHG under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulation Section 1036.150(d). Starting in 2020, as a result of the Weichai ownership change in April 2019, those products no longer qualified for the exemption and must meet Phase 1 GHG standards. In order to address the impact of the transition of its emission regulation requirements in 2020 and 2021, the Company licensed its technology to a third-party small manufacturer to produce and certify the 6.0L gasoline engine and utilized averaging, banking, and trading compliance provisions for the sale of its 8.8L gasoline engine. New EPA Phase 2 GHG regulations began January 1, 2021. The Company plans to meet Phase 2 GHG standards utilizing averaging, banking, and trading compliance provisions. Future changes to the regulations and/or failure of the Company to comply with the regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nSupply Chain\nThe Company is dependent on third-party suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these key suppliers, or the failure to find replacement suppliers or manufacturers in a timely manner, could result in supply shortages.\nThe Company sources engines, components and replacement parts used in the assembly of its power systems and aftermarket sales from various third-party suppliers. Much of the technology incorporated into the components that the Company sources from a limited number of suppliers is technologically sophisticated, and the Company does not believe that its competitors have access to some of this sophisticated technology. The Company\u2019s business could be harmed by adverse changes in its relationships with these suppliers, including through the management of the timing of payables, or if its competitors gain access to such technology. The viability of certain key third-party suppliers, or the exiting by certain suppliers of certain business lines, could require the Company to find other suppliers for materials or components. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in work stoppages at certain suppliers that are part of the Company\u2019s supply chain. During 2021, the Company experienced delays in its supply chain due to temporary shortages of raw materials and container delays of overseas materials as bottlenecks occurred at ports in Asia and North America. This, in turn, has caused delivery delays to some of the Company\u2019s customers. If future work stoppages were to be prolonged or expanded in scope, there could be additional supply shortages, which could continue to impact the Company\u2019s ability to deliver its products to customers on schedule. Some components cannot be quickly or inexpensively re-sourced to another supplier due to long lead times and contractual commitments that might be required by another supplier in order to provide the components or materials. Any extended delay in receiving engines or other critical components, or the inability of third-party suppliers to meet the Company\u2019s quality, quantity or cost requirements, could impair or prohibit the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products to its OEM customers.\nThe loss of certain of the Company\u2019s exclusive supply and distribution agreements, coupled with the Company\u2019s inability to manufacture or source alternative products, could have a material adverse impact on its financial results.\nThe Company is the exclusive supplier and distributor of certain engine products sourced from certain engine manufacturers. The agreements provide the Company with the exclusive rights to distribute the associated products in certain geographic regions. The Company may not be able to extend the agreements or may not achieve acceptable pricing. For example, the Company was an exclusive supplier of the GM 6.0L engine to OEMs and GM has discontinued the engine. The Company does not have an agreement with GM to supply on-highway OEMs with GM\u2019s successor product to the 6.0L engine. If the Company is not able to maintain the arrangements or achieve competitive pricing, then it may need to find alternative products through either alternative supply sources or the design and manufacture of competitive products to meet customer demands. The loss of any of the exclusive supply agreements and failure to source alternative products could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial results. In addition, the exclusive agreements often include minimum purchase requirements. The failure\nto reach the minimum purchase requirements could result in financial penalties or the loss of exclusivity that could be material to the Company.\nThe Company utilizes a global supply chain to source products, including engines, components and materials, which may subject it to tariffs, including U.S. tariffs imposed on imports from China. The Company also sells its products on a global basis, and therefore its export sales could be impacted by tariffs.\nSeveral of the Company\u2019s products are sourced internationally, including from China, where the United States has imposed tariffs on specified products imported from China. These tariffs have an impact on the Company\u2019s material costs and have the potential to have an even greater impact, depending on the outcome of future trade negotiations and policies. The Company is evaluating U.S. government policy, which is subject to change in the current negotiating environment, pricing, its supply chain and its operational strategies to mitigate the impact of these tariffs; however, there can be no assurances that any mitigation strategies employed will remain available under government policy or that the Company will be able to offset tariff-related costs or maintain competitive pricing of its products. Further, the imposition of tariffs on imports from China and other countries has the potential to materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s sales, profitability and future product launches. The Company also sells its products on a global basis; and, therefore, its export sales could be impacted by the tariffs. Any material reduction in sales may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nGrowth and Profitability\nThe market for alternative-fueled, spark-ignited power systems may not continue to develop as expected.\nThe continued market acceptance and growth of the market for efficient alternative-fueled, spark-ignited power systems, including natural gas, propane and gasoline, is a key tenet of the Company\u2019s growth strategy. The impact of diesel emission regulations is expected to increase the cost and complexity of diesel power systems, but this may not materialize to the expected extent or at all. Also, customers, or potential customers, may not substitute natural gas-, propane- and gasoline-powered power systems for diesel power systems in response to these regulations. In addition, to the extent that diesel power system manufacturers develop the ability to design and produce emission-compliant diesel power systems that are more competitive than the Company\u2019s alternative-fueled power systems, customers and potential customers may be less likely to substitute alternative-fueled power systems for diesel power systems. Furthermore, if alternative-fueled power systems are substituted for diesel power systems, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s power systems would capture any portion of the potential market increase. If the industrial OEM market generally, or more specifically any of the OEM categories that represent a significant portion of the Company\u2019s business or in which it anticipates significant growth opportunities for its power systems, fails to develop or develops more slowly than the Company anticipates, its business could be materially adversely affected. Lastly, the Company also faces competition from other forms of power systems, including electric and fuel cells, for example, which could limit its ability to grow in the future.\nThe Company may be impacted by volatility of oil and gas prices and/or fuel price differentials.\nThe prices of various fuel alternatives are subject to fluctuation, based upon many factors, including global supply and demand, changes in resource base, pipeline transportation capacity for natural gas, refining capacity for crude oil, and government excise and fuel tax policies. The price differential among various fuel alternatives can impact OEMs and their decisions on which, if any, power systems they purchase from the Company. Furthermore, if OEMs do decide to purchase the Company\u2019s power systems, relative fuel prices may affect which power systems they purchase, and the margins can vary significantly among the Company\u2019s various power systems.\nThe Company may be affected by the price of oil and gas. For example, when the price of oil declines, oil becomes a more favorable source of fuel in the short term, and alternative fuel and energy producers suffer as a result. This volatility, as with any commodity, will occur from time to time and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nAlso, a significant portion of the Company\u2019s sales and profitability has historically been derived from sales of products that are used in the oil and gas industry, primarily in support of operating wells. Various factors, such as capital allocation strategies, oil pricing, rig counts, and governments policies, among others, could lead oil and gas producers curtail or limit capital expenditures as was experienced in both 2020 and 2021. In addition, oil and gas producers may cease or suspend production at well sites that have or are likely to become unprofitable. As a result, sales of the Company\u2019s products could be severely impacted during periods of a prolonged depression in energy prices, rig counts and capital expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. The Company estimates that as much as approximately $25 million and $45 million of its 2021 and 2020 net sales, respectively, were attributable to the sale of products used within the oil and gas industry. The potential impact of future disruptions, continued economic uncertainty, and continued depressed crude oil prices and low rig count levels may have a significant adverse impact that may result in the recognition of material impairments or other related charges.\nThe introduction of new products, including new engines that the Company develops, and the continued expansion of products in the power systems and transportation markets may not succeed or achieve widespread acceptance.\nThe Company\u2019s growth depends on its ability to develop and/or acquire new products and/or refine existing products and power system technology, to complement and enhance the breadth of its power system offerings with respect to engine class and the OEM market categories into which the Company supplies its products. The Company will generally seek to develop or acquire new products, or enhance existing products and power system technology, if it believes such acquisitions or enhancements will provide significant additional sales and favorable profit margins. However, the Company cannot know beforehand whether any new or enhanced products will successfully penetrate target markets. There can be no assurance that newly developed or acquired products will perform as well as the Company expects, or that such products will gain widespread adoption among the Company\u2019s customers.\nAdditionally, there are greater design and operational risks associated with new products. The inability of the Company\u2019s suppliers to produce technologically sophisticated components for new engines and power systems, the discovery of any product or process defects or failures associated with production of any new products, and any related product returns could each have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and its results of operations. If new products that the Company expends significant resources to develop or acquire are not successful, or such products do not achieve the required production volume and scale, its business could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s strategy includes production of in-house developed and manufactured engines used by OEM customers, including large transportation OEMs. The costs and regulations involved with developing and certifying an engine for transportation applications are significant and may be higher and more stringent than expected. Additionally, the stresses and demands on engines and power systems used for transportation applications could result in unexpected issues. The discovery of any significant problems with these engines could result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, potential product liability claims, and reputational and brand risks. Sales of the Company\u2019s internally developed engines could lead to significantly higher warranty costs to service these engines if they do not perform to expectations.\nThe Company\u2019s OEM customers may not continue to outsource their power system needs.\nThe purchasers of the Company\u2019s power systems are OEMs that manufacture a wide range of applications and equipment that include standby and prime power generation, demand response, microgrid, combined heat and power, utility power, arbor equipment, material handling (including forklifts), agricultural and turf, construction, pumps and irrigation, compressors, utility vehicles, light- and medium-duty vocational trucks, and school and transit buses. As a result of the significant resources and expertise required to develop and manufacture emission-certified power systems, certain of these customers have historically chosen to outsource production of power systems to the Company. To a significant extent, the Company depends on OEMs continuing to outsource design and production of power systems, power system components and subsystems. OEM customers may not continue to outsource as much or any of their power system production in the future. Increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 business strategies, acquisition by a customer of a power system manufacturer or the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any number of these factors could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company currently faces, and will continue to face, significant competition.\nThe market for the Company\u2019s products and related services is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and sensitive to new-product and service introductions and changes in technical requirements. New developments in power system technology may negatively affect the development or sale of some or all of the Company\u2019s power systems or make them uncompetitive or obsolete. Other companies, some of which have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and significantly greater financial and marketing resources than the Company, are currently engaged in the development of products and technologies that are similar to, or may be competitive with, certain of the Company\u2019s products and power system technologies. If the markets for its products grow as the Company anticipates, competition may intensify, as existing and new competitors identify opportunities in such markets.\nThe Company faces competition from companies that employ current power system technologies, and it may face competition in the future from additional companies as new power system technologies are adopted. Additionally, the Company may face competition from companies developing technologies such as cleaner diesel engines, biodiesel, fuel cells, electrification, advanced batteries and hybrid battery/internal combustion power systems. The Company may not be able to incorporate such technologies into its product offerings, or it may be required to devote substantial resources to do so. The success of its business depends in large part on its ability to provide single assembly, integrated, comprehensive, technologically sophisticated power systems to its customers. The development or enhancement by its competitors of similar capabilities could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nTechnology and Intellectual Property\nFailure to keep pace with technological developments may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company is engaged in an industry that will be affected by future technological developments. The Company\u2019s success will depend upon its ability to develop and introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products, applications and\nprocesses that keep pace with technological developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. The Company may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes, and product or process enhancements. The Company may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes. The Company\u2019s products, applications or processes may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. If the Company were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes, or product or process enhancements, or if its products do not gain market acceptance, its results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company could fail to adequately protect its intellectual property rights or could face claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties.\nThe Company believes that the success of its business depends, in substantial part, upon its proprietary technology, information, processes and know-how. The Company does not own any material patents and relies on a combination of trademark and trade secret laws, along with confidentiality agreements, contractual provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect its intellectual property rights. Despite the Company\u2019s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights, existing laws afford only limited protection, and the Company\u2019s actions may be inadequate to protect its rights or to prevent others from claiming violations of their proprietary rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect the Company\u2019s proprietary rights as fully or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. The unauthorized use of the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights and proprietary technology by others could materially harm its business.\nIn addition, the Company cannot be certain that its products, services and power system technologies, including any intellectual property licensed from third parties for use therein or incorporated into components that it sources from its suppliers, do not, or in the future will not, infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties. In the future, the Company may be subject to infringement claims that may result in litigation. Successful infringement claims against the Company could result in substantial monetary liability, require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, or otherwise materially disrupt the conduct of the Company\u2019s business. In addition, even if the Company prevails in the defense of any such claims, any such litigation could be time-consuming and expensive to defend or settle and could materially adversely affect its business.\nHuman Capital\nThe loss of key members of management or failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel could, in the future, affect the Company\u2019s business results.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on its ability to attract, retain and motivate a highly-skilled and diverse management team and workforce. During 2021, the Company has experienced significant leadership changes, including appointing a new Chief Executive Officer, a new Chief Financial Officer, and a new Chief Technical Officer. Also, its Executive Vice President and Co-Founder retired from the Company. Executive leadership transitions can be difficult to manage and could cause disruption to the Company\u2019s business. Failure to ensure that the Company has the depth and breadth of management and personnel with the necessary skill set and experience could impede its ability to deliver growth objectives and execute its operational strategy. Competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily upon engineering and technology is at times intense, and the loss of qualified employees could hinder the Company\u2019s ability to conduct research activities successfully and develop marketable products. As the Company continues to expand, it will need to promote or hire additional staff, and, as a result of increased compensation and benefit mandates, it may be difficult to attract or retain such individuals without incurring significant additional costs.\nCommon Stock Ownership and Stockholder Influence\nOwnership of the Company\u2019s stock is concentrated among certain former employees and Weichai, therefore limiting other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of March 28, 2022, Weichai beneficially owned 51.2% of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares of Common Stock. Additionally, Gary S. Winemaster, the Company\u2019s founder, former Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and President and nonexecutive Chief Strategy Officer, beneficially owned approximately 14.5% of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares of Common Stock, and Kenneth J. Winemaster, the Company\u2019s co-founder and former Executive Vice President, beneficially owned approximately 9.6% of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares of Common Stock. Each of these stockholders, by virtue of their significant equity ownership in the Company, may be able to significantly influence, and, in the case of Weichai, control the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger or other significant corporate transactions. The interests of these stockholders may not coincide with the interests of other stockholders. The concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company that other stockholders may view as beneficial. With the exercise of the Weichai Warrant, Weichai alone owns a\nmajority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and, therefore, it possesses voting control over the Company sufficient to prevent any change of control from occurring.\nWeichai also maintains certain rights through its Investor Rights Agreement with the Company.\nWeichai entered into an Investor Rights Agreement (the \u201cRights Agreement\u201d) with the Company upon execution of the SPA. The Rights Agreement provides Weichai with representation on the Company\u2019s Board and management representation rights. Weichai currently has four representatives on the Board which constitutes the majority of the directors serving on the Board. According to the Rights Agreement, during any period when the Company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ Listing Rules, it will take such measures as to avail itself of the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemptions available under Rule 5615 of the NASDAQ Listing Rules of Rules 5605(b), (d) and (e). With Weichai being the majority owner of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares of its Common Stock, Weichai will be able to exercise control over matters requiring stockholders\u2019 approval, including the election of the Directors, amendment of the Company\u2019s Charter and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions impractical without the support of Weichai.\nThe continued delisting of its Common Stock could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe historical failure to timely file its periodic reports with the SEC resulted in the Company not being in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC, and triggered the delisting of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. The Company\u2019s delisting and potential inability to remediate failures to comply with applicable NASDAQ rules to be relisted could have a material adverse effect on the Company by, among other things, reducing:\n\u2022the liquidity of its Common Stock;\n\u2022the market price of its Common Stock;\n\u2022the number of institutional and other investors that will consider investing in its Common Stock;\n\u2022the number of market makers in its Common Stock;\n\u2022the availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of its Common Stock;\n\u2022the number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of its Common Stock;\n\u2022the Company\u2019s ability to obtain equity financing for the continuation of its operations;\n\u2022the Company\u2019s ability to use its equity as consideration in any merger transaction; and\n\u2022the effectiveness of equity-based compensation plans for its employees used to attract and retain individuals important to the Company\u2019s operations.\nNOLs and Future Tax Payments\nThe Company\u2019s inability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future may limit the Company\u2019s ability to use net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards to reduce future tax payments.\nThe Company has NOL carryforwards with which to offset its future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax reporting purposes. If the Company should fail to generate a sufficient level of taxable income prior to the expiration of the NOL carryforward periods, then it will lose the ability to apply the NOLs as offsets to future taxable income. Similar limitations also apply to certain U.S. federal tax credits.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe Company is exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, potential security breaches or other disruptions to its information technology systems and data security.\nThe Company relies on its information technology systems and networks in connection with many of its business activities. The Company\u2019s operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to its business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. Cyber incidents could materially disrupt operational systems, result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information, compromise personally identifiable information regarding customers or employees, and jeopardize the security of the Company\u2019s facilities. A cyber incident could be caused by malicious outsiders using sophisticated methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption and other security defenses. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Information technology security threats, including security breaches, computer\nmalware and other cyber-attacks, are increasing in both frequency and sophistication and could create financial liability, subject the Company to legal or regulatory sanctions, or damage its reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders. The Company continuously seeks to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on its reputation and results of operations.\nThe Company is exposed to political, economic and other risks, in addition to various laws and regulations that arise from operating a multinational business.\nThe Company sells products internationally and sources a significant amount of materials from suppliers outside of the U.S. Accordingly, the Company is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating a multinational company, including risks related to the following:\n\u2022general economic conditions;\n\u2022the imposition of tariffs and other import or export barriers, which could potentially disrupt the Company\u2019s existing supply chains and impose additional costs on the Company\u2019s business;\n\u2022trade and technology protection measures;\n\u2022compliance with regulations governing import and export activities;\n\u2022import and export duties and restrictions;\n\u2022currency fluctuations and exchange restrictions;\n\u2022transportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022potentially adverse income tax consequences;\n\u2022political and economic instability;\n\u2022terrorist activities;\n\u2022acts of war, including the events currently underway in Ukraine, which could lead to volatility in commodity availability and pricing, access to current or new markets, and general overall market volatility and weakness, among other factors;\n\u2022labor unrest;\n\u2022natural disasters; and\n\u2022public health concerns including the potential negative impacts to suppliers, customers or the Company\u2019s business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the Company\u2019s business in 2020 and 2021 and will likely have future impacts in 2022 and beyond. Furthermore, the extent and duration of such impacts over the longer term remain uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the coronavirus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken, including mobility restrictions and work restrictions, and the impact of these and other factors on the Company\u2019s customer base, suppliers, and general commercial activity.\nAlso, the Company is subject to, and may become subject to, various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing its business, environmental, labor, trade and tax practices. These laws and regulations, particularly those applicable to the Company\u2019s international operations, are or may be complex, extensive and subject to change. The Company needs to ensure that it and its OEM customers and suppliers timely comply with such laws and regulations, which may result in increased operating costs. Other legislation has been, and may in the future be, enacted in other locations in which the Company manufactures or sells its products. If the Company or its component suppliers fail to timely comply with applicable legislation, its customers may refuse to purchase its products, or it may face increased operating costs as a result of taxes, fines or penalties. In connection with complying with such environmental laws and regulations as well as with industry environmental initiatives, the standards of business conduct required by some of its customers and its commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of its business, the Company could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to its operations and logistics. In addition, if the Company were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliant with these initiatives or standards of conduct, it could be subject to governmental fines, liability to its customers and damage to its reputation and corporate brand, any of which could cause its financial condition or results of operations to suffer.\nLastly, the Company\u2019s overseas sales are subject to numerous stringent U.S. and foreign laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and comparable foreign laws and regulations, which prohibit improper payments or offers of payments\nto foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Safeguards that the Company implements to discourage these practices could prove to be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and other laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against the Company, including class action lawsuits and enforcement actions from the SEC, the USAO and overseas regulators. Any of these factors, or any other international factors, could impair the Company\u2019s ability to effectively sell its power systems, or other products or services that it may develop, outside of the United States.", "PERMNO": 13939, "SIC": 3510, "TIC": "PSIX"}
