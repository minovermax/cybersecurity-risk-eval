{"cik": "1141103", "company": "CROSS COUNTRY HEALTHCARE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our future operating results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forward-looking statements we make about our business. Our risks are identified primarily through dialogue with our leaders, including a formal Enterprise Risk assessment, industry trends, our experience, and consideration of the current external market and financial environment. These risk factors are considered in our overall strategy and execution of operations. Factors we currently consider immaterial and factors we currently do not know may also materially adversely affect our business or our consolidated results, financial condition, or cash flows.\nBusiness, Economic, and Industry Risks\nOur operations and financial results have been and may continue to be affected by the ongoing COVID pandemic and related ancillary issues and could be materially harmed by COVID or the emergence and effects related to any other pandemics, epidemics, or other public health crisis.\nOur operations and financial results have been and may continue to be affected by the ongoing COVID pandemic and changes in national or global economic conditions related thereto.\nDuring the COVID pandemic, certain of our healthcare professionals have been exposed, diagnosed and/or quarantined as a result of the virus. At this time, the federal government has mandated vaccinations for healthcare workers, healthcare workers are burned out from the emotional and physical stress of the prolonged pandemic, and the shortage of supply continues as core staff also leave their jobs. If, as a result of such risks, our healthcare professionals do not want to, or are not able to provide services, it could negatively impact our supply and ability to provide staffing services to our customers. In addition, census at healthcare facilities continues to vary for many reasons. All of these effects from the pandemic can result in reduced demand for our services or the cancellation of our healthcare professionals working at those facilities or under contract to provide services\nat those facilities in the future. These effects have also created specific demand in certain specialties and in specific regions of the country.\nIn some instances, the increased demand in specific geographic regions and specialties has resulted in increased bill rates for our industry to attract the necessary supply which has resulted in inquiries and/or investigations related to pricing in the industry. We continue to provide data, industry insights, and market analytics to guide clients\u2019 decisions to determine the appropriate rates necessary to attract clinicians to fill their needs when they need them; however, there can be no certainty that we will not incur costs in response to any such inquiries in the future or that bill rates will continue at current levels as the pandemic subsides.\nIn addition, the normal operations of our healthcare facility customers may be disrupted and impacted in ways that are difficult to predict and their financials could be adversely affected. This would not just negatively impact our staffing and workforce solutions business, but would also have an adverse effect on our search businesses (contingent, permanent, and retained) as healthcare customers may delay making decisions for executives, physicians, nurses, and other full-time staff. In addition to the negative impact on demand from our hospital and healthcare facility customers, school closures and various mandates in the wake of the COVID pandemic have had an adverse impact on our school staffing.\nThe financial impact to our healthcare customers from COVID or any other pandemic, epidemic, outbreak of an infectious disease or other public health crisis may also impact their ability to pay for our services timely or altogether, including invoices for services provided prior to such an event that were in process. Such a failure to pay for our services timely or altogether would have an impact on our collections, resulting in a negative financial impact on our Company.\nFinally, while we have disaster plans in place for all of our locations and we are able to operate remotely, the potential continuation of the COVID pandemic, or the emergence of another pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak is difficult to predict and could adversely affect our operations. For example, our operations are headquartered in South Florida and if our employees are working remotely as a result of a public health crisis during hurricane season and electricity, Wi-Fi, and other resources are temporarily restricted or not available, it could negatively impact our operations and financial results.\nDecreases in demand or pricing by our clients may adversely affect the profitability of our business.\nAmong other things, changes in the economy, a decrease or stagnation in the general level of in-patient admissions or out-patient services at our clients\u2019 facilities, uncertainty regarding or changes to federal healthcare law and the willingness of our hospital, healthcare facilities and physician group clients to develop their own temporary staffing pools, replace core staff who have resigned or retired during the pandemic, or to increase the productivity of their permanent staff may, individually or in the aggregate, significantly affect demand for our temporary healthcare staffing services and may hamper our ability to attract, develop and retain clients. When a hospital\u2019s admissions increase, temporary employees or other healthcare professionals are often added before full-time employees are hired. As admissions decrease, clients typically reduce their use of temporary employees or other healthcare professionals before undertaking layoffs of their permanent employees. In addition, if hospitals continue to consolidate in an effort to enhance their market positions, improve operational efficiency, hire permanent replacements to replace core staff, and create organizations capable of managing population health, demand for our services could decrease. Decreases in demand or pricing for our services may also affect our ability to provide attractive assignments to our healthcare professionals.\nWe may face challenges competing in the marketplace if we are unable to anticipate and quickly respond to changing marketplace conditions, such as alternative modes of healthcare delivery, reimbursement, and client needs.\nPatient delivery settings continue to evolve, giving rise to alternative modes of healthcare delivery, such as retail medicine, telemedicine and home health.\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to develop innovative workforce solutions and quickly adapt to changing marketplace conditions and client needs, including making modifications to our technologies and evolving our technology platform that may differentiate our services and abilities from those of our competitors. The markets in which we compete are highly competitive and our competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging client needs and marketplace conditions. The development of new service lines and business models using advanced technology solutions requires us to be at the forefront of emerging trends in the healthcare industry. We may face challenges competing in the marketplace if we are unable to quickly adapt our business model and successfully implement innovative services and solutions to address these changes.\nMarket disruptions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nEconomic conditions and volatility in the financial markets may have an adverse impact on the availability of credit to us and to our customers and businesses generally. To the extent that disruption in the financial markets occurs, it has the potential to\nmaterially affect our and our customers\u2019 ability to tap into debt and/or equity markets to continue ongoing operations, have access to cash and/or pay debts as they come due. These events could negatively impact our results of operations and financial conditions. Although we monitor our credit risks to specific clients that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk or lack of access to liquidity may result from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. Conditions in the credit markets and the economy generally could adversely impact our business and limit or prohibit us from refinancing our credit agreements on terms favorable to us or at all when they become due.\nWe are subject to business and regulatory risks associated with international operations.\nWe have international operations in India where our Cross Country Infotech, Pvt Ltd. (Infotech) subsidiary is located. Infotech provides in-house information systems development and support services as well as some back-office processing services. We have limited experience in supporting our services outside of North America. Operations in certain markets are subject to risks inherent in international business activities, including: (i) fluctuations in currency exchange rates; (ii) changes in regulations; (iii) varying economic and political conditions; (iv) overlapping or differing tax structures; and (v) regulations (pertaining to, among other things, compensation and benefits, vacation, and the termination of employment). Our inability to effectively manage our international operations or our violation of a regulation could result in increased costs and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur financial results could be adversely impacted by the loss of key management or corporate employee turnover.\nWe believe the successful execution of our business strategy and our ability to build upon significant recent investments and acquisitions depends on the continued employment of key members of our management team and corporate employees. If we were to lose any key personnel, we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected. Further, the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur clients may terminate or not renew their contracts with us.\nOur arrangements with hospitals, healthcare facilities and physician group clients are generally terminable upon 30 to 90 days\u2019 notice. We may have fixed costs, such as housing costs, associated with terminated arrangements that we will be obligated to pay post-termination, thus negatively impacting our profitability. In addition, the loss of one or more of our large clients could materially affect our profitability.\nIf our healthcare facility clients increase the use of intermediary organizations it could impact our profitability and our ability to secure contracts with clients.\nWe continue to see our clients use intermediary organizations and an increase in the use of side-by-side managed service providers. Intermediaries typically enter into contracts with hospitals or health systems and then subcontract with us and other agencies to provide staffing services, thus interfering to some extent in our relationship with our clients. Each of these intermediaries charges an administrative fee. Due to the increased demand during the pandemic, hospitals have also used two or more MSP providers to fill their open positions. In instances where we do not win new MSP opportunities or where other vendors win this MSP, a side-by-side MSP opportunity, or vendor management system (VMS) business with our current customers, the number of professionals we have on assignment at those clients could decrease. If we are unable to negotiate hourly rates with intermediaries for the services we provide at these clients which are sufficient to cover administrative fees charged by those intermediaries, it could impact our profitability. If hospitals fail to pay the intermediaries for our services or those intermediaries become insolvent or fail to pay us for our services, it could impact our bad debt expense and thus our overall profitability. We also provide comprehensive MSP and other workforce solutions directly to certain of our clients. While such contracts typically improve our market share at these facilities, they could result in less diversification of our customer base, increased liability, and reduced margins.\nOur costs of providing services may rise faster than we are able to adjust our bill rates and pay rates and, as a result, our margins could decline and our profitability could be adversely impacted.\nCosts of providing our services could change more quickly than we are able to renegotiate bill rates in our active contracts and pay rates with our thousands of healthcare professionals. For example, we offer housing subsidies to some of our healthcare professionals or provide actual housing to other healthcare professionals. At any given time, we have approximately 750 apartments on lease throughout the U.S. because we provide housing for certain of our healthcare professionals when they are on an assignment with us. The cost of subsidizing housing or renting apartments and furniture for these healthcare professionals may increase faster than we are able to renegotiate our rates with our customers, and this may have a negative impact on our profitability. In addition, an increase in other incremental costs beyond our control, such as insurance could negatively affect our financial results. The costs related to obtaining and maintaining professional and general liability insurance, health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation insurance for healthcare providers has generally been increasing. This could have an\nadverse impact on our financial condition unless we are able to pass these costs through to our clients or renegotiate pay rates with our healthcare providers.\nOperational Risks\nWe are dependent on the proper functioning of our information systems and applications hosted by our vendors, and our inability to implement new technology systems and infrastructure could cause disruptions to our ability to operate effectively.\nWe are dependent on the proper functioning of information systems used to operate our business, including those applications hosted by our vendors. Critical information systems used in daily operations identify and match staffing resources and client assignments and perform billing and accounts receivable functions. Additionally, we rely on our information systems in managing our accounting and financial reporting. These systems are subject to certain risks, including technological obsolescence. We are currently evaluating the technology platforms of our businesses, and replacing our legacy nurse and allied applicant tracking system. If our proprietary systems of SaaS applications fail, are not successfully implemented, or are otherwise unable to function in a manner that properly supports our business operations, or if these systems require significant costs to repair, maintain or further develop or update, we could experience business interruptions or delays that could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn addition, our information systems are protected through a secure hosting facility and additional backup remote processing capabilities also exist in the event our primary systems fail or are not accessible. However, the business is still vulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, telecommunications failures, physical or software break-ins and similar events which may prevent personnel from gaining access to systems necessary to perform their tasks in an automated fashion. In the event that critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable, these functions would have to be accomplished manually, which could impact our ability to, among other things, maintain billing and clinical records reliably, to bill for services efficiently and to maintain our accounting and financial reporting accurately.\nWe are dependent on third parties for the execution of certain critical functions.\nWe have outsourced certain critical applications or business processes to external providers, including but not limited to background screenings of our employees. We exercise care in the selection and oversight of these providers. However, the failure or inability to perform on the part of one or more of these critical suppliers could cause significant disruptions and increased costs to our business. In addition, we rely on third-party timekeeping systems in certain circumstances to process payroll. To the extent that these payroll systems experience a disruption or delay in reporting time worked by our healthcare professionals, we may not be able to make payroll to our healthcare workers timely. This could result in significant dissatisfaction by our healthcare workers and damage to our reputation, in addition to violations of certain laws or regulations. We have a risk mitigation plan in place in the event this were to occur, but the inability to effectively implement this plan or its failure could cause an adverse impact to our business and our financials.\nOur collection, use, and retention of personal information and personal health information create risks that may harm our business.\nAs part of our business model, we collect, transmit and retain personal information of our employees and contract professionals and their dependents, including, without limitation, full names, social security numbers, addresses, birth dates, and payroll-related information. We use commercially available information security technologies to protect such information in digital format and have security and business controls to limit access to such information. In addition, we periodically perform penetration tests and respond to those findings. However, employees or third parties may be able to circumvent these measures and acquire or misuse such information, resulting in breaches of privacy, and errors in the storage, use or transmission of such information. Privacy breaches may require notification and other remedies, which can be costly, and which may have other serious adverse consequences for our business, including regulatory penalties and fines, claims for breach of contract, claims for damages, adverse publicity, reduced demand for our services by clients and/or healthcare professional candidates, harm to our reputation, and regulatory oversight by state or federal agencies. The possession and use of personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards, or contractual obligations.\nCyber security risks and security breaches could adversely affect our business, disrupt operations, and harm our reputation.\nCyber incidents and security breaches can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, malware, ransomware, or causing operational disruption. The result of these incidents could\ninclude, but are not limited to, disrupted operations, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cyber security protection costs, litigation and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence. We have implemented systems and processes to focus on identification, prevention, mitigation and resolution. However, these measures cannot provide absolute security, and our systems may be vulnerable to cyber-security breaches such as viruses, hacking, ransomware, and similar disruptions from unauthorized intrusions. In addition, we rely on third-party service providers to perform certain services, such as payroll and tax services. Any failure of our systems or third-party systems may compromise our sensitive information and/or personally identifiable information of our employees. While we have secured cyber insurance to potentially cover certain risks associated with cyber incidents, there can be no assurance the insurance will be sufficient to cover any such liability.\nWe may be unable to recruit and retain enough quality healthcare professionals to meet our clients\u2019 demands.\nWe rely significantly on our ability to attract, develop and retain healthcare professionals who possess the skills, experience and, as required, licensure necessary to meet the specified requirements of our healthcare clients. We compete for healthcare staffing personnel with other temporary healthcare staffing companies, as well as actual and potential clients such as healthcare facilities and physician groups, some of which seek to fill positions with either permanent or temporary employees. We rely on word-of-mouth referrals, as well as social and digital media to attract qualified healthcare professionals. If our social and digital media strategy is not successful, our ability to attract qualified healthcare professionals could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, with a shortage of certain qualified healthcare professionals in many areas of the United States, competition for these professionals remains intense. Our ability to recruit and retain healthcare professionals depends on our ability to, among other things, offer assignments that are attractive to healthcare professionals and offer them competitive wages and benefits or payments, as applicable. Our competitors might increase hourly wages or the value of benefits to induce healthcare professionals to take assignments with them. If we do not raise wages or increase the value of benefits in response to such increases by our competitors, we could face difficulties attracting and retaining qualified healthcare professionals. If we raise wages or increase benefits in response to our competitors\u2019 increases, our clients and our margins could decline. At this time, we still do not have enough nurses, allied professionals and physicians to meet all of our clients\u2019 demands for these staffing services. This shortage of healthcare professionals generally and the competition for their services may limit our ability to increase the number of healthcare professionals that we successfully recruit, decreasing our ability to grow our business.\nOur labor costs could be adversely affected by a shortage of experienced healthcare professionals and labor union activity.\nOur operations are dependent on our ability to recruit and staff quality healthcare professionals. We compete with other staffing companies and technologies in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel. We may be required to enhance wages and benefits to our employees, which could negatively impact our profitability. Labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs or otherwise adversely impact us. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our labor costs could increase significantly.\nIf our labor costs increase, we may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs. Because a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed, prospective payments, our ability to pass along increased labor costs is constrained. In the event we are not entirely effective at recruiting and retaining qualified management, nurses and other medical support personnel, or in controlling labor costs, this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nLegal, Tax, and Regulatory Risks\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated. Any material changes in the political, economic or regulatory environment that affect the purchasing policies, practices and operations of healthcare organizations, or that lead to consolidation in the healthcare industry, could reduce the funds available to purchase our services or otherwise require us to modify our offerings.\nWe provide our services to hospitals and health systems which pay us directly. Accordingly, Medicare, Medicaid and insurance reimbursement policy changes generally do not directly impact us. However, indirectly, our business, financial condition and results of operations depend upon conditions affecting the healthcare industry generally and hospitals and health systems particularly. The healthcare industry is highly regulated by federal and state authorities and is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences. Factors such as changes in reimbursement policies for healthcare expenses, consolidation in the healthcare industry, regulation, litigation and general economic conditions could affect the purchasing practices, operations and the financial health of our customers which could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, application and interpretation of laws sometimes change and those changes may spark regulatory inquiries/investigations as a result, for which we may not be insured and which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Insurance companies and managed care organizations also seek to control costs by requiring healthcare providers, such as hospitals, to discount their services in exchange for exclusive or preferred participation in their benefit plans. While not affecting us directly, future federal and state legislation or evolving commercial reimbursement trends may further reduce or change conditions for\nour clients\u2019 reimbursement. Such limitations on reimbursement could reduce our clients\u2019 cash flows, hampering the pricing we can charge clients and their ability to pay us. Reimbursement changes in government programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid, can and do indirectly affect the demand and the prices paid for our services. The impact of any other legislation to repeal or amend or replace the ACA is uncertain and could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe operate our business in a regulated industry and modifications, inaccurate interpretations or violations of any applicable statutory or regulatory requirements may result in material costs or penalties as well as litigation and could reduce our revenue and earnings per share.\nOur industry is subject to many complex federal, state, local and international laws and regulations related to, among other things, the licensure of professionals, the payment of our field employees (e.g., wage and hour laws, employment taxes, arbitration agreements, and income tax withholdings, etc.) and the operations of our business generally (e.g., federal, state and local tax laws). If we do not comply with the laws and regulations that are applicable to our business, we could incur civil and/or criminal penalties as well as litigation or be subject to equitable remedies. We maintain insurance coverage for employment claims, however, it may not cover all claims against us or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost. If our insurance does not cover the particular claim or if we are unable to pay our self-insured retention portion, pay any uninsured portion, or maintain adequate insurance coverage, we may be exposed to substantial liabilities that would materially impact our business and financial performance.\nWe are subject to various litigation, claims, investigations, and other proceedings which could result in substantial judgment, settlement costs, or uninsured liabilities.\nWe are party to various litigation, claims, investigations, and other proceedings. These matters primarily relate to employee-related matters that include individual and collective claims, professional liability, tax, and payroll practices. We evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, if any, we establish reserves and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments are performed at least quarterly and are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Based on the new information considered in our reviews, we adjust our loss contingency accruals and our disclosures. We may not have sufficient insurance to cover these risks. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from those estimated by our current assessments which would impact our profitability. Adverse developments in existing litigation claims or legal proceedings involving our Company or new claims could require us to establish or increase litigation reserves or enter into unfavorable settlements or satisfy judgments for monetary damages for amounts in excess of current reserves, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn recent years, healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging malpractice, vicarious liability, violation of certain consumer protection acts, negligent hiring, negligent credentialing, or related legal theories. We may be subject to liability in such cases even if our Company's contribution to the alleged injury was minimal or related to one of our subcontractors or its employees. Many of these actions involve large claims and significant defense costs. In addition, we may be subject to claims related to torts or crimes committed by our corporate employees or healthcare professionals that we place on assignment. In most instances, we are required to indemnify clients against some or all of these risks. A failure of any of our corporate employees or healthcare professional to observe our policies and guidelines, relevant client policies and guidelines or applicable federal, state or local laws, rules and regulations could result in negative publicity, payment of fines or other damages.\nTo protect ourselves from the cost of these types of claims, we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance, employment practices liability insurance, and general liability insurance coverage with terms and in amounts with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations. We are partially self-insured for our workers' compensation coverage, health insurance coverage, and professional liability coverage for our locum tenens providers. If we become subject to substantial uninsured workers' compensation, medical coverage or medical malpractice liabilities, whether directly or indirectly, our financial results may be adversely affected. In addition, our insurance coverage may not cover all claims against us or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost. If we are unable to pay our self-insured retention portion, pay any uninsured portion, or maintain adequate insurance coverage, we may be exposed to substantial liabilities.\nIf applicable government regulations change, we may face increased costs that reduce our revenue and profitability.\nThe temporary healthcare staffing industry is regulated in many states. For example, in some states, firms such as our nurse staffing companies must be registered to establish and advertise as a nurse-staffing agency or must qualify for an exemption from registration in those states. If we were to lose any required state licenses, we could be required to cease operating in those states. The introduction of new regulatory provisions could also substantially raise the costs associated with hiring temporary employees. For example, some states could impose sales taxes or increase sales tax rates on temporary healthcare staffing services. Also, as a result of the COVID pandemic, several states have enacted various legislation to expand the application of\nworkers compensation and other benefits to healthcare providers who are exposed to or who contract COVID through their employment, and certain of our clients are requiring us to provide personal protection equipment to our workers. These increased costs may not be able to be passed on to clients. In addition, if government regulations were implemented that limited the amount we could charge for our services, our profitability could be adversely affected. We continuously monitor changes in regulations and legislation for potential impacts on our business.\nWe could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions, if there are further legislative tax changes, or if we are unable to utilize our net operating losses.\nWe are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business. We also have deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses (NOLs) in state taxing jurisdictions, which, generally, for state tax purposes, carry forward for up to twenty years or indefinitely, depending on the year the NOL was generated. Tax years generally remain subject to examination until three years after NOLs are used or expire. We expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future. We recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority. We believe our judgments in this area are reasonable and correct, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful if challenged by a taxing authority. If there are tax benefits, including, but not limited to, the use of NOLs, expense reimbursements, or other tax attributes, that are challenged successfully by a taxing authority, we may be required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties, or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities, which could require significant payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, federal, state and local, as well as international, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. On March 27, 2020, the former President signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act into law, which was extended under the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Relief Act of 2020 passed on December 27, 2020. Further, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA). We are not aware of any provision in the CARES Act, ARPA, or any other pending tax legislation that would have a material adverse impact on our financial performance. There can be no assurance that the CARES Act, ARPA, the 2017 Tax Act, or any other legislative changes will not negatively impact our operating results, financial condition, and future business operations.\nLastly, we may be limited in our ability to utilize our remaining state NOLs to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our otherwise payable income taxes. Our ability to utilize our NOLs is also dependent, in part, upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our state NOLs before they expire. If market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our state NOLs, we could be required to record additional valuation allowance. We review the valuation allowances for our state NOLs periodically and make adjustments from time to time, which can result in an increase or decrease to the net deferred tax asset related to our state NOLs. If we are unable to use our state NOLs or use of our state NOLs is limited, we may have to make significant payments or reduce our deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf certain of our healthcare professionals are reclassified from independent contractors to employees our profitability could be materially adversely impacted.\nFederal or state taxing authorities could re-classify our locum tenens physicians, CRNAs, nurse practitioners, and other independent contractors as employees, despite both the general industry standard to treat them as independent contractors and many state laws prohibiting non-physician owned companies from employing physicians (e.g., the \u201ccorporate practice of medicine\u201d). Other than in California where advanced practitioners are required to be classified as W-2 employees by law, if they were re-classified as employees, we would be subject to, among other things, employment and payroll-related tax claims, as well as any applicable penalties and interest. Any such reclassification would have a material adverse impact on our business model for that business segment and would negatively impact our profitability.\nIf the method for paying locum tenens physicians changes, it could negatively impact our profitability.\nThe Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 created a new framework for rewarding physicians for providing higher quality care by establishing two tracks of payment: a merit-based incentive payment system, and Advanced Alternative Payment Models. If hospitals change the method for paying locum tenens physicians to meet their performance goals or other criteria for Medicaid or Medicare reimbursements, the profitability of our business could be adversely impacted.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nWe have a level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business, strategic or financing opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had a total principal amount of $183.5 million in debt. Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal, interest or other amounts due on our indebtedness. Subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. This may have the effect of increasing our total leverage. As a consequence of our indebtedness; (i) demands on our cash resources may increase; (ii) we are subject to restrictive covenants that limit our financial and operating flexibility. Our ability to generate profitability and maintain cash flow from operations could impact our compliance with these covenants; and (iii) we may choose to institute self-imposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates, our relative leverage and our strategic plans. For example, as a result of our level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the U.S. economy:\n- we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n- we may have to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable rate indebtedness if interest rates rise, thereby reducing our cash flows;\n- we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate requirements that would be in our long-term interests;\n- we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the available cash flow to fund other investments;\n- we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry;\n- we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged;\n- we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet payment obligations; and\n- we may not be able to successfully raise capital to execute our mergers and acquisitions strategy.\nThese constraints could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe interest rates under our Term Loan Credit Agreement (Term Loan Agreement) and our ABL Credit Agreement (Loan Agreement) may be impacted by the phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).\nLIBOR is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rates on loans globally. We use LIBOR as a reference rate to calculate interest under our Term Loan Agreement and our Loan Agreement. In 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the preferred alternative reference rate to U.S. dollar LIBOR and recommended a paced transition plan that involves the creation of a reference rate based on SOFR by the end of 2021. SOFR is a more generic measure than LIBOR and considers the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. Given the inherent differences between LIBOR and SOFR or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established, there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from LIBOR. Our Term Loan Agreement and our Loan Agreement contain a fallback provision providing for alternative rate calculations in the event LIBOR is unavailable, prior to any LIBOR rate transition. As a result of any changes in the benchmarking rate, the new rates we incur may not be as favorable to us as those in effect prior to any LIBOR phase-out, and we may incur higher interest payments.\nWe could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs and/or fail to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under our existing indebtedness, which could adversely affect long term growth and results of operations.\nWe currently have sufficient liquidity to operate our business in the normal course. If, however, we were to make an acquisition or enter into a similar type of transaction, our liquidity needs may exceed our current capacity. In addition, our existing credit facilities currently contain financial covenants that require us to operate above a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and below a consolidated leverage ratio. Deterioration in our operating results could result in our inability to comply with these\ncovenants and would result in a default under our credit facility. If an event of default exists, our lenders could call the indebtedness and we may be unable to renegotiate or secure other financing.\nGeneral Business Risks\nWe may face difficulties integrating our acquisitions into our operations and our acquisitions may be unsuccessful, involve significant cash expenditures or expose us to unforeseen liabilities.\nWe continually evaluate opportunities to acquire companies that would complement or enhance our business. These acquisition opportunities involve numerous risks, including potential loss of key employees or clients of acquired companies; difficulties integrating acquired personnel and distinct cultures into our business; difficulties integrating acquired companies into our operating, financial planning and financial reporting systems; diversion of management attention from existing operations; and assumptions of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, including liabilities for their failure to comply with healthcare and tax regulations. These acquisitions may also involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence and integration expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any acquisition may ultimately have a negative impact on our business and financial condition.\nNotwithstanding the due diligence investigation we perform in connection with acquisitions, the acquired business may have liabilities, losses, or other exposures for which we do not have adequate insurance coverage, indemnification, or other protection.\nWhile we perform significant due diligence prior to signing purchase agreements, we are dependent on the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the sellers and their representatives when conducting due diligence and evaluating the results of such due diligence. We do not control and may be unaware of activities of the sellers before the acquisition, including intellectual property and other litigation or disputes, information security vulnerabilities, violations of laws, policies, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other liabilities.\nThe sellers\u2019 obligations to indemnify us is limited to, among others, breaches of specified representations and warranties and covenants included in the purchase agreement and other specific indemnities as set forth in the purchase agreement. In the event of a breach of a representation or warranty, other than a core representation (as defined in the purchase agreement), sellers' obligation to indemnify us may be limited to the time frame in which the loss arises and the amount of the loss. If any issues arise post-closing, we may not be entitled to sufficient, or any, indemnification or recourse from the sellers, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nLosses caused by natural disasters, such as hurricanes and fires, could cause us to suffer material financial losses.\nCatastrophes can be caused by various events, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, fires, and other severe weather. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. With our headquarters, shared services, and many of our remote workers located in South Florida, we are more vulnerable to possible disruptions from hurricanes and the impacts resulting therefrom, such as tornadoes, flooding, fuel shortages, and disruption of internet, and telecommunications services. We also have a significant amount of business and employees in California, which is vulnerable to wild-fires and earthquakes. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure and the severity of the event. We do not maintain business interruption insurance for these events. We could suffer material financial losses as a result of disruptions from hurricanes, fires, or other catastrophes.\nLegislative or regulatory initiatives related to climate change and other corporate responsibility or sustainability matters could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGreenhouse gases may have an adverse effect on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Such events could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business. Concern over climate change may result in new or additional legislative and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, which could result in future tax, transportation, and utility increases and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. There is also increased focus, including by investors, customers, and other stakeholders, on these and other sustainability matters, including the use of plastic, energy, waste, and worker safety. The Company\u2019s reputation could be damaged if the Company does not, or is perceived to not, act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters, which could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nDue to inherent limitations, there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors and fraud, or in making all material information known in a timely manner to management.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the acts of an individual, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.\nThe design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nImpairment in the value of our goodwill, trade names, or other intangible assets could negatively impact our net income and earnings per share.\nWe are required to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives (such as trade names) annually, to determine if impairment has occurred. Long-lived assets and other identifiable intangible assets are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that amounts may not be recoverable. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying amount of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset in the period the determination is made. The testing of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in our stock price and market capitalization. Changes in these factors, or changes in actual performance compared with estimates of our future performance, could affect the fair value of goodwill, trade names, or other intangible assets, which may result in an impairment charge. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be an adverse effect on us. At December 31, 2021, goodwill, trade names not subject to amortization, and other intangible assets represented 23% of our total assets. In 2020 and 2019, we recorded impairment charges of $10.7 million and $14.5 million, respectively.\nIf provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law delay or prevent a change in control, we may be unable to consummate a transaction that our stockholders consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. Without shareholder approval, the Board of Directors has the authority to attach special rights, including voting and dividend rights, to this preferred stock. With these rights, preferred stockholders could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us. Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us.\nStock issuable under our stock incentive plans are presently in effect and sales of this stock could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have registered 3,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under our 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Shares of restricted stock outstanding as of February 15, 2022 were 1,039,455. In addition, a target of 522,166 performance stock award grants were outstanding as of February 15, 2022. See Note 15 - Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Vested restricted stock and issuance of common stock related to our awards is eligible for resale in the public market without restriction. We cannot predict what effect, if any, market sales of shares held by any shareholder or the availability of these shares for future sale will have on the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 89167, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "CCRN"}
