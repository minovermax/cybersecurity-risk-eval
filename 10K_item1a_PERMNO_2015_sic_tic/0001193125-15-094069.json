You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the other information in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. These risks could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe service industries that are highly cyclical, and any downturn in our customers\u2019 industries could reduce our sales and profitability. The economic downturn has reduced demand for our products and may continue to reduce demand until an economic recovery.\nMany of our products are sold to industries that experience significant fluctuations in demand based on economic conditions, energy prices, seasonality, consumer demand and other factors beyond our control. These industries include manufacturing, electrical production and transportation. We do not expect the cyclical nature of our industry to change.\nThe U.S. economy entered an economic recession in December 2007, which spread to many global markets in 2008 and 2009 and affected Ryerson and other metals service centers. Beginning in late 2008 and continuing through 2014, the metals industry, including Ryerson and other service centers, felt additional effects of the global economic crisis and recovery thereto and the impact of the credit market disruption. These events contributed to a rapid decline in both demand for our products and pricing levels for those products. The Company has implemented a number of actions to conserve cash, reduce costs and strengthen its competitiveness, including curtailing non-critical capital expenditures, initiating headcount reductions and reductions of certain employee benefits, among other actions. However, there can be no assurance that these actions, or any others that the Company may take in response to further deterioration in economic and financial conditions, will be sufficient.\nThe volatility of the market could result in a material impairment of goodwill.\nWe evaluate goodwill annually on October 1 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to our historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner or the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. We test for impairment of goodwill by calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using an average of an income approach based on discounted future cash flows and a market approach at the date of valuation. Under the discounted cash flow method, the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on expected future economic benefits discounted to a present value at a rate of return commensurate with the risk associated with the investment. Projected cash flows are discounted to present value using an estimated weighted average cost of capital, which considers both returns to equity and debt investors. Significant changes in any one of the assumptions made as part of our analysis, which could occur as a result of actual events, or further declines in the market conditions for our products, could significantly impact our impairment analysis. An impairment charge, if incurred, could be material.\nA substantial decline in the value of our available-for-sale security may result in an \u201cother than temporary\u201d impairment charge.\nOur investment in one available-for-sale security has unrealized losses of $6.2 million as of December 31, 2014. We may be required to record future impairment charges on our investment if it suffers further declines in value that are considered other-than-temporary, and such other-than-temporary impairment charges would adversely affect our earnings. Considerations used to determine other-than-temporary impairment status to investment securities available-for-sale include, but are not limited to, an increase in the severity of the unrealized loss on a particular security, an increase in the length of time unrealized losses continue without an improvement in value, a change in our intent or ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the forecasted recovery, or changes in market conditions or industry or issuer specific factors that would render us unable to forecast a full recovery in value.\nThe metals distribution business is very competitive and increased competition could reduce our revenues and gross margins.\nThe principal markets that we serve are highly competitive. The metals distribution industry is fragmented and competitive, consisting of a large number of small companies and a few relatively large companies. Competition is based principally on price, service, quality, production capabilities, inventory availability and timely delivery. Competition in the various markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes, some of which have greater financial resources than we have and some of which have more established brand names in the local markets served by us. Increased competition could reduce our market share, force us to lower our prices or to offer increased services at a higher cost, which could reduce our profitability.\nThe economic downturn has reduced metals prices. Though prices have risen since the onset of the economic downturn, we cannot assure you that prices will continue to rise. Changing metals prices may have a significant impact on our liquidity, net sales, gross margins, operating income and net income.\nThe metals industry as a whole is cyclical and, at times, pricing and availability of metal can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control, including general domestic and international economic conditions, labor costs, sales levels, competition, levels of inventory held by other metals service centers, consolidation of metals producers, higher raw material costs for the producers of metals, import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of materials for us.\nWe, like many other metals service centers, maintain substantial inventories of metal to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic buying practices, contracts with customers and market conditions. When metals prices decline, as they did in 2008 and 2009, customer demands for lower prices and our competitors\u2019 responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and, consequently, lower margins as we use existing metals inventory. Notwithstanding recent price increases, metals prices may decline, and declines in those prices or further reductions in sales volumes could adversely impact our ability to maintain our liquidity and to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants under our $1.35 billion revolving credit facility agreement (as amended and restated, the \u201cRyerson Credit Facility\u201d), as well as result in us incurring inventory or goodwill impairment charges. Changing metals prices therefore could significantly impact our liquidity, net sales, gross margins, operating income and net income.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations.\nWe currently have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, our total indebtedness was approximately $1,259.1 million and we had approximately $245 million of unused capacity under the Ryerson Credit Facility. Our substantial indebtedness may:\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our outstanding notes and our other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nWe may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes restrict but do not prohibit us from doing so, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nThe covenants in the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indentures governing our notes impose, and covenants contained in agreements governing indebtedness that we incur in the future may impose, restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe Ryerson Credit Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, including JT Ryerson, to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens or use assets as security in other transactions;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate or transfer or dispose of substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates.\nThe terms of the Ryerson Credit Facility require that, in the event availability under the facility declines to a certain level, we maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. Total credit availability is limited by the amount of eligible accounts receivable and inventory pledged as collateral under the agreement insofar as the Company is subject to a borrowing base comprised of the aggregate of these two amounts, less applicable reserves. As of December 31, 2014, total credit availability was $245 million based upon eligible accounts receivable and inventory pledged as collateral.\nAdditionally, subject to certain exceptions, the indentures governing the outstanding notes restrict JT Ryerson\u2019s ability to pay us dividends to the extent of 50% of future net income, once prior losses are offset. Future net income is defined in the indenture governing the notes as net income adjusted for, among other things, the inclusion of dividends from joint ventures actually received in cash by JT Ryerson, and the exclusion of: (i) all extraordinary gains or losses; (ii) a certain portion of net income allocable to minority interest in unconsolidated persons or investments in unrestricted subsidiaries; (iii) gains or losses in respect of any asset sale on an after tax basis; (iv) the net income from any disposed or discontinued operations or any net gains or losses on disposed or discontinued operations, on an after-tax basis; (v) any gain or loss realized as a result of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles; (vi) any fees and expenses paid in connection with the issuance of the notes; (vii) non-cash compensation expense incurred with any issuance of equity interest to an employee; and (viii) any net after-tax gains or losses attributable to the early extinguishment of debt. Our future indebtedness may contain covenants more\nrestrictive in certain respects than the restrictions contained in the Ryerson Credit Facility and the indentures governing the notes. Operating results below current levels or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in our being unable to comply with financial covenants that are contained in the Ryerson Credit Facility or that may be contained in any future indebtedness. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of our notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our outstanding notes, the Ryerson Credit Facility and our other outstanding indebtedness are expected to account for significant cash interest expenses. Accordingly, we will have to generate significant cash flows from operations to meet our debt service requirements. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and working capital requirements, we may be required to sell assets, seek additional capital, reduce capital expenditures, restructure or refinance all or a portion of our existing indebtedness, or seek additional financing. Moreover, insufficient cash flow may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nBecause a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing short-term interest rates, we are vulnerable to interest rate increases.\nA portion of our indebtedness, including the Ryerson Credit Facility, bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain short-term prevailing interest rates. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $435.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility, with an additional $245 million available for borrowing under such facility. Assuming a consistent level of debt, a 100 basis point change in the interest rate on our floating rate debt effective from the beginning of the year would increase or decrease our interest expense under the Ryerson Credit Facility by approximately $3.7 million on an annual basis. If interest rates increase dramatically, we could be unable to service our debt which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may not be able to successfully consummate and complete the integration of future acquisitions, and if we are unable to do so, we may be unable to increase our growth rates.\nWe have grown through a combination of internal expansion, acquisitions and joint ventures. We intend to continue to grow through selective acquisitions, but we may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, obtain financing on satisfactory terms, consummate acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses effectively and profitably into our existing operations. Restrictions contained in the agreements governing our notes, the Ryerson Credit Facility or our other existing or future debt may also inhibit our ability to make certain investments, including acquisitions and participations in joint ventures.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to complete the integration of these future acquisitions successfully into our operations. After any acquisition, customers may choose to diversify their supply chains to reduce reliance on a single supplier for a portion of their metals needs. We may not be able to retain all of our and an acquisition\u2019s customers, which may adversely affect our business and sales. Integrating acquisitions, particularly large acquisitions, requires us to enhance our operational and financial systems and employ additional qualified personnel, management and financial resources, and may adversely affect our business by diverting management away from day-to-day operations. Further, failure to successfully integrate acquisitions may adversely affect our profitability by creating significant operating inefficiencies that could increase our operating expenses as a percentage of sales and reduce our operating income. In addition, we may not realize expected cost savings from acquisitions, which may also adversely affect our profitability.\nWe may not be able to retain or expand our customer base if the North American manufacturing industry continues to erode through moving offshore or through acquisition and merger or consolidation activity in our customers\u2019 industries.\nOur customer base primarily includes manufacturing and industrial firms. Some of our customers operate in industries that are undergoing consolidation through acquisition and merger activity; some are considering or have considered relocating production operations overseas or outsourcing particular functions overseas; and some customers have closed as they were unable to compete successfully with overseas competitors. Our facilities are predominately located in the United States and Canada. To the extent that our customers cease U.S. operations, relocate or move operations overseas to regions in which we do not have a presence, we could lose their business. Acquirers of manufacturing and industrial firms may have suppliers of choice that do not include us, which could impact our customer base and market share.\nCertain of our operations are located outside of the United States, which subjects us to risks associated with international activities.\nCertain of our operations are located outside of the United States, primarily in Canada, China, Mexico and Brazil. We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments or otherwise corruptly giving any other thing of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires companies to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices. The FCPA applies to covered companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for some actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. If we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA, governmental authorities in the United States could seek to impose civil and/or criminal penalties.\nThe Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities, particularly with regards to the land our facilities are located on.\nThe Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Moreover, the Chinese court system does not provide the same property and contract right guarantees as do courts in the United States and, accordingly, disputes may be protracted and resolution of claims may result in significant economic loss.\nAdditionally, although in recent years the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, there is no private ownership of land in China and all land ownership is held by the government of China, its agencies, and collectives, which issue land use rights that are generally renewable. We lease the land where our Chinese facilities are located from the Chinese government. Although we believe our relationship with the Chinese government is sound, if the Chinese government decided to terminate our land use rights agreements, our assets could become impaired and our ability to meet customer orders could be impacted.\nOur revenue and operating results may fluctuate, which could result in a decline in our profitability and make it more difficult for us to grow our business.\nOur revenue and operating results have historically varied from quarter to quarter. Periods of decline could result in an overall decline in profitability and make it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness and grow our business. We expect our quarterly results to continue to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in the markets where we operate; and\n\u2022\nthe cyclical nature of our customers\u2019 business\nDamage to our information technology infrastructure could harm our business.\nThe unavailability of any of our computer-based systems for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In particular, our ability to manage inventory levels successfully largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to track inventory information at individual facilities, communicate customer information and aggregate daily sales, margin and promotional information. Difficulties associated with upgrades, installations of major software or hardware, and integration with new systems could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. We will be required to expend substantial resources to integrate our information systems with the systems of companies we have acquired. The integration of these systems may disrupt our business or lead to operating inefficiencies. In addition, these systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage or interruption from fire, flood, tornado and other natural disasters, power loss, computer system and network failures, operator negligence, physical and electronic loss of data, or security breaches and computer viruses.\nAny significant work stoppages can harm our business.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we employed approximately 3,200 persons in North America, 400 persons in China, and 50 persons in Brazil. Our North American workforce was comprised of approximately 1,500 office employees and approximately 1,700 plant employees. Twenty-six percent of our plant employees were members of various unions, including the United Steel Workers and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Our relationship with the various unions has generally been good.\nEight renewal contracts covering approximately 170 employees were successfully negotiated in 2014. We also successfully negotiated a first contract for a recently organized facility in Montreal, Quebec in 2014. Eight contracts covering approximately 200 employees are currently scheduled to expire in 2015.\nCertain employee retirement benefit plans are underfunded and the actual cost of those benefits could exceed current estimates, which would require us to fund the shortfall.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our pension plan had an unfunded liability of $277 million. Our actual costs for benefits required to be paid may exceed those projected and future actuarial assessments to the extent that those costs exceed the current assessment. Under those circumstances, the adjustments required to be made to our recorded liability for these benefits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and cash payments to fund these plans could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows. We may be required to make substantial future contributions to improve the plan\u2019s funded status.\nFuture funding for postretirement employee benefits other than pensions also may require substantial payments from current cash flow.\nWe provide postretirement life insurance and medical benefits to eligible retired employees. Our unfunded postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2014 was $101 million. Our actual costs for benefits required to be paid may exceed those projected and future actuarial assessments to the extent that those costs exceed the current assessment. Under those circumstances, adjustments will be required to be made to our recorded liability for these benefits.\nAny prolonged disruption of our processing centers could harm our business.\nWe have dedicated processing centers that permit us to produce standardized products in large volumes while maintaining low operating costs. We may suffer prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities, whether due to labor or technical difficulties, destruction or damage to any of the facilities or otherwise.\nIf we are unable to retain and attract management and key personnel, it may adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our success is due, in part, to our experienced management team. Losing the services of one or more members of our management team such as our CEO, Michael C. Arnold, who has announced that he will retire from the Company in 2015, could adversely affect our business and possibly prevent us from improving our operational, financial and information management systems and controls. In the future, we may need to retain and hire additional qualified sales, marketing, administrative, operating and technical personnel, and to train and manage new personnel. Our ability to implement our business plan is dependent on our ability to retain and hire a large number of qualified employees each year.\nOur existing international operations and potential joint ventures may cause us to incur costs and risks that may distract management from effectively operating our North American business, and such operations or joint ventures may not be profitable.\nWe maintain foreign operations in Canada, China, Mexico and Brazil. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business in, and with, foreign countries, including price controls, exchange controls, export controls, economic sanctions, duties, tariffs, limitations on participation in local enterprises, nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates. While we believe that our current arrangements with local partners provide us with experienced business partners in foreign countries, events or issues, including disagreements with our partners, may occur that require attention of our senior executives and may result in expenses or losses that erode the profitability of our foreign operations or cause our capital investments abroad to be unprofitable.\nLead time and the cost of our products could increase if we were to lose one of our primary suppliers.\nIf, for any reason, our primary suppliers of aluminum, carbon steel, stainless steel or other metals should curtail or discontinue their delivery of such metals in the quantities needed and at prices that are competitive, our business could suffer. The number of available suppliers could be reduced by factors such as industry consolidation and bankruptcies affecting steel and metal producers. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our top 25 suppliers represented approximately 75% of our purchases. We could be significantly and adversely affected if delivery were disrupted from a major supplier. If, in the future, we were unable to obtain sufficient amounts of the necessary metals at competitive prices and on a timely basis from our traditional suppliers, we may not be able to obtain such metals from alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedules, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nWe could incur substantial costs related to environmental, health and safety laws.\nOur operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws. These include laws that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of regulated materials and the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil, surface water and groundwater. Failure to maintain or achieve compliance with these laws or with the permits required for our operations could result in substantial increases in operating costs and capital expenditures. In addition, we may be subject to fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, worker\u2019s compensation or personal injury claims, cleanup costs or temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations. Certain of our facilities are located in industrial areas, have a history of heavy industrial use and have been in operation for many years and, over time, we and other predecessor operators of these facilities have generated, used, handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes. Environmental liabilities could exist, including cleanup obligations at these facilities or at off-site locations where materials from our operations were disposed of, which could result in future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Such liabilities may be imposed without regard to fault or the legality of a party\u2019s conduct and may, in certain circumstances, be joint and several. Future changes to environmental, health and safety laws, including those related to climate change, could result in material liabilities and costs, constrain operations or make such operations more costly for us, our suppliers and our customers. In October 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency named us as one of more than 100 businesses that may be a potentially responsible party for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site. We do not currently have sufficient information available to us to determine the total cost of any required investigation or remediation of the Portland Harbor site and therefore, management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate a range of potential loss at this time.\nRegulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOn August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) adopted new requirements for reporting companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require companies to diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to conclusively verify the origins for all metals used in our products and we may face reputational challenges with our customers. Additionally, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d metals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Accordingly, we could incur significant cost related to the compliance process, including potential difficulty or added costs in satisfying the disclosure requirements. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.\nWe are subject to litigation that could strain our resources and distract management.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits and other disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. These suits concern issues including product liability, contract disputes, employee-related matters and personal injury matters. It is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending suits and claims, and the ultimate resolution of these matters as well as future lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or reputation.\nWe may face product liability claims that are costly and create adverse publicity.\nIf any of the products that we sell cause harm to any of our customers, we could be exposed to product liability lawsuits. If we were found liable under product liability claims, we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Further, even if we successfully defended ourself against this type of claim, we could be forced to spend a substantial amount of money in litigation expenses, our management could be required to spend valuable time in the defense against these claims and our reputation could suffer.\nOur risk management strategies may result in losses.\nFrom time to time, we may use fixed-price and/or fixed-volume supplier contracts to offset contracts with customers. Additionally, we may use foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge Canadian dollar and floating rate debt exposures. These risk management strategies pose certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position may exceed the amount invested in such instruments. Moreover, a party in a hedging transaction may be unavailable or unwilling to settle our obligations, which could cause us to suffer corresponding losses. A hedging instrument may not be effective in eliminating all of the risks inherent in any particular position. Our profitability may be adversely affected during any period as a result of use of such instruments.\nWe may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations in the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar and the Chinese renminbi.\nWe have significant operations in Canada which incur the majority of their metal supply costs in U.S. dollars but earn the majority of their sales in Canadian dollars. Additionally, we have significant assets in China. We may from time to time experience losses when the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Canadian dollar or the Chinese renminbi, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we will be subject to translation risk when we consolidate our Canadian and Chinese subsidiaries\u2019 net assets into our balance sheet. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar or Chinese renminbi could reduce the value of these assets as reported in our financial statements, which could, as a result, reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity.", "PERMNO": 14855, "SIC": 5051, "TIC": "RYI"}
