Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business and Forward-Looking Statements\nThis annual report and our other oral or written communications may contain \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements. These statements may include our expectations or projections about the future of our industries, business strategies, the markets in which we operate, potential acquisitions, contracts with customers, new business opportunities or financial results and our views about developments beyond our control including government spending, domestic or global economic conditions, trends and market forces. These statements are based on management\u2019s views and assumptions at the time originally made, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements, except as may be required by law. There can be no assurance that our expectations, projections or views will come to pass, and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.\nA number of significant risk factors could materially affect our specific business operations and cause our performance to differ materially from any future results projected or implied by our prior statements, including those described below. Many of these risk factors are also identified in connection with the more specific descriptions contained throughout this report.\nCustomers\nWe anticipate operating losses in the near term as we seek to generate new business revenues to replace the loss of our largest customer.\nOur businesses generally will require a higher level of new business revenues in order to operate profitably. The recent loss of revenues from Dana has accelerated our need to launch new programs with existing customers and to diversify our business by adding new customers. While we expect to generate operating losses in the near term due to the loss of Dana as a customer, we intend to steadily increase our revenues over this time with new or existing customers by utilizing our excess manufacturing capacity. Unless we can develop and offer new products and services to existing customers or obtain new customers, we may be unable to maintain the critical mass of capital investments or talented employees that are needed to succeed in our chosen markets or to maintain our existing facilities, which could result in additional restructuring or exit costs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate enough additional revenue to offset the loss of revenues from Dana through new or existing customers.\nCustomer contracts may not be renewed on acceptable terms or at all. Our largest customer Dana has repudiated our supply relationship and stopped placing orders with us as of the end of 2014.\nUntil recently, our two largest customers, Dana and Meritor, had contracts with expiration dates of December 31, 2014 and, for a portion of the Meritor goods, May 2, 2015. In 2014, Dana and Meritor represented approximately 59% and 16% of our revenues. While we have renewed the Meritor agreement and have executed an extension of the Dana contract through 2019, Dana has repudiated that extension, which repudiation is currently being litigated and arbitrated (see \u201cLegal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Even if we prevail on some or all of the items under dispute, we do not expect to retain Dana as a customer. In 2015, we do not expect to do business directly with Dana. Our inability to replace the loss of Dana business while effectively controlling our costs would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCustomer contracts could be less profitable than expected.\nWe generally bear the risk that our contracts could be unprofitable or less profitable than planned, despite our estimates of revenues and future costs to complete such contracts.\nA material portion of our business, historically, has been conducted under multi-year contracts, which generally include fixed prices or periodic price reductions without minimum purchase requirements. Over time, our revenues may not cover our increasing operating costs which could adversely impact our results. Our financial results are at greater risk when we accept contractual responsibility for raw material or component prices, when we cannot offset price reductions and cost increases with operating efficiencies or other savings, when we must submit contract bid prices before all key design elements are finalized or when we are subjected to other competitive pressures which erode our margins. The profitability of our contracts also can be adversely affected by unexpected start-up costs on new programs, operating inefficiencies, ineffective capital investments, inflationary pressures or inaccurate forecasts of future unit costs.\nIn the past, we have signed long-term supply agreements with Dana and Meritor and acquired their facilities in Morganton, North Carolina and Toluca, Mexico, among other manufacturing assets. Although most of these acquired facilities have had well-established product markets, the Company does not currently expect to continue doing business directly with Dana. In addition, Meritor\u2019s products may not continue to be successful, product enhancements may not be made in a timely fashion, and any long-term pricing agreements could generate lower margins than anticipated. If any of these facilities are required to operate at underutilized levels for extended periods of time, especially those plants with traditionally higher percentages of Dana business, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnexpected changes in our customers\u2019 demand levels have harmed our operating results in the past and could do so in the future. Many of our customers will not commit to firm production or delivery schedules. Disagreements over pricing, quality, delivery, capacity, exclusivity or trade credit terms could disrupt order schedules. Orders may also fluctuate due to changing global capacity and demand, new products, changes in market share, reorganizations or bankruptcies, material shortages, labor disputes or other factors that discourage outsourcing. These forces could increase, decrease, accelerate, delay or cancel our delivery schedules.\nInaccurate forecasting of our customers\u2019 requirements can disrupt the efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity, inventories or workforce. If we lose anticipated revenues, we might not succeed in redeploying our substantial capital investment and other fixed costs, potentially forcing additional plant closures, impairments of long-lived and other assets or increased losses. If we receive unanticipated orders or rapid increases in demand, these incremental volumes could be unprofitable due to the higher costs of operating above our optimal capacity.\nWe depend on a few key customers in challenging industries for most of our revenues. We have recently lost our largest customer and continue to have substantial customer concentration.\nOur five largest customers in 2014 were Dana, Meritor, Sistemas, Axle Alliance and Northrop Grumman, collectively accounting for 85% of net revenue. Our five largest customers in 2013 were Dana, Meritor, Sistemas, Northrop Grumman and Eaton, collectively accounting for 81% of net revenue. In 2015, we do not currently expect to continue doing business directly with Dana. Our inability to replace the loss of Dana business while effectively controlling our costs would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In 2015 and beyond, we will need to attract new clients and attempt to diversify our customer base from a limited number of potential customers and with longer lead times often being required for new programs.\nThe truck components and assemblies industry has experienced credit risk, highly cyclical market demand, labor unrest, rising steel costs, bankruptcy and other obstacles, while the aerospace and defense electronics industry has experienced consolidation, increased competition, disruptive new technologies and uncertain funding. We depend on the continued growth and financial stability of these customers and our core markets, as well as general economic conditions. Adverse changes affecting these customers, markets or economic conditions could harm our operating results. The truck components and assemblies market is highly cyclical, due in part to regulatory deadlines, the availability or scarcity of credit, fluctuations in oil prices and pent-up demand for replacement vehicles.\nRising costs of steel or component parts could increase our inventory and working capital levels and present challenges to our customers who seek to pass those costs on to their customers. Many of our customers\u2019 labor disputes, financial difficulties and restructuring needs have created rising uncertainty and risk, which could increase our costs or impair our business model.\nThe aerospace and defense industry is pressured by cyclicality, rapid technological change, shortening product life cycles, decreasing margins, unpredictable funding levels and government procurement and certification processes. Our aerospace and defense business faces an aging portfolio of legacy products and services which must be replenished with new technologies if we are to successfully maintain or expand our market share. Our failure to address any of these factors, particularly in our secured electronic communications or space engineering programs, could impair our business model.\nThere can be no assurance that any of our customers will not default on, delay or dispute payment of, or seek to reject our outstanding invoices in bankruptcy or otherwise. In addition, the existence of these factors may result in fewer customers in our target markets due to consolidation, bankruptcy, competitive or other market reasons, making it more difficult to obtain new clients and diversify our customer base in the near future.\nCongressional budgetary constraints or reallocations could reduce our government sales.\nOur Electronics Group sells manufacturing services and products to a number of U.S. government agencies, which in the aggregate represented approximately 2% and 3% of our net revenue in 2014 and 2013, respectively. We also serve as a contractor for large aerospace and defense companies such as Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Exelis, typically under federally funded programs, which represented approximately 4% and 5% of net revenue in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe Electronics Group already has been significantly adversely affected by declines in the overall government defense market due to the effects of sequestration, and may be further affected if funding for programs in which we participate, either by selling services and products directly to U.S. government agencies or as a subcontractor to prime contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Excelis, is reduced, delayed or cancelled. Our ability to obtain new contract awards also could be negatively affected.\nCongress and the Administration continue to debate these funding issues, but reductions in U.S. military spending also could materially adversely affect the results of our Electronics Group, and we expect that certain military and defense programs will experience delays while the receipt of government approvals remain pending.\nFuture levels of governmental spending, including delays, declines or reallocations in the funding of certain programs could adversely affect our financial results, if we are unable to offset these changes with new business or cost reductions.\nSuppliers\nInterruptions in the supply of key components could disrupt production.\nSome of our manufacturing services or products require one or more components that are available from a limited number of providers or from sole-source providers. In the past, some of the materials we use, including steel, certain forgings or castings, capacitors and memory and logic devices, have been subject to industry-wide shortages or capacity allocations. As a result, suppliers have been forced to allocate available quantities among their customers, and we have not been able to obtain all of the materials desired. Some of our suppliers have struggled to implement reliable quality control systems which can negatively impact our operating efficiency and financial results. In downward business cycles, the tightening of credit markets has threatened the financial viability of an increasing number of suppliers of key components and raw materials and forced unanticipated shutdowns. Our inability to reliably obtain these or any other materials when and as needed could slow production or assembly, delay shipments to our customers, impair the recovery of our fixed costs and increase the costs of recovering to customers\u2019 schedules, including overtime, expedited freight, equipment maintenance, operating inefficiencies, higher working capital and the obsolescence risks associated with larger buffer inventories. Each of these factors could adversely affect operating results.\nShortages or increased costs of utilities could harm our business and our customers.\nWe and our customers depend on a constant supply of electricity and natural gas from utility providers for the operation of our respective businesses and facilities. In the past, we have experienced power outages which reduced our ability to deliver products and meet our customers\u2019 demand for those products. If we or our customers experience future interruptions in service from these providers, our production and/or delivery of products could be negatively affected. Additionally, due to the heavy consumption of energy in our production process and the businesses of our customers, if the cost of energy significantly increases, our results of operations and those of our customers could be negatively impacted.\nExecution\nContract terminations or delays could harm our business.\nWe often provide manufacturing services and products under contracts that contain detailed specifications, quality standards and other terms. If we are unable to perform in accordance with such terms, our customers might seek to terminate such contracts, demand price concessions or other financial consideration or downgrade our past performance rating, an increasingly critical factor in federal procurement competitions. Moreover, many of our contracts are subject to termination for convenience or upon default. These provisions could provide only limited recoveries of certain incurred costs or profits on completed work and could impose liability for our customers\u2019 costs in procuring undelivered items from another source. If any of our significant contracts were to be repudiated, terminated or not renewed, such as the Dana contract described above, we would lose substantial revenues, and our operating results as well as prospects for future business opportunities could be adversely affected. For example, as described above, our supply agreement with Dana represented approximately 59% of our revenues in 2014, and this agreement has been repudiated by Dana effective as of December 31, 2014 (see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nWe are subject to various audits, reviews and investigations, including private party \u201cwhistleblower\u201d lawsuits, relating to our compliance with federal and state laws. Should our business be charged with wrongdoing, or determined not to be a \u201cpresently responsible contractor,\u201d we could be temporarily suspended or debarred for up to three or more years from receiving new government contracts or government-approved subcontracts.\nWe must operate more efficiently than usual due to lower revenues.\nIf we are unable to improve the cost, efficiency and yield of our operations, and if we are not able to control costs, our financial results could suffer and we could be forced to sell assets, refinance our debt at higher costs or take other measures to restructure our operations or capital structure. A number of major obstacles could include: an inability to effectively control costs during our efforts to replace the loss of Dana revenues; the loss of other substantial revenues due to a sluggish economic recovery; inflationary pressures; increased borrowing due to declines in sales; changes in anticipated product mix and the associated variances in our profit margins; efforts to increase our manufacturing capacity and launch new programs; efforts to migrate, restructure or move business operations from one location to another; the breakdown of critical machinery or equipment; the need to identify and eliminate our root causes of scrap; our ability to achieve expected annual savings or other synergies from past and future business combinations; inventory risks due to shifts in market demand; obsolescence; price erosion of raw material or component parts; shrinkage, or other factors affecting our inventory valuations; and an inability to successfully manage growth, contraction or competitive pressures in our primary markets.\nOur management or systems could be inadequate to support our existing or future operations, especially as we downsize our operating staff to reduce expenses while we work to replace the loss of Dana revenues. New customers or new contracts, particularly with new product offerings, could require us to invest in additional equipment or other capital expenditures. We may have limited experience or expertise in installing or operating such equipment, which could negatively impact our ability to deliver products on time or with acceptable costs. In addition, a material portion of our manufacturing equipment requires significant maintenance to operate effectively, and we may experience maintenance and repair issues. Our efforts to restructure, relocate and consolidate a significant number of the operations, especially in our truck component manufacturing plants, could cause certain of these facilities to operate at underutilized levels, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In our Electronics Group, the risk of technical failures, nonconformance with customer specifications, an inability to deliver next generation products or other quality concerns could materially impair our operating results.\nOur growth strategies could be ineffective due to the risks associated with further acquisitions.\nOur growth strategy has included acquiring complementary businesses. We could fail to identify, obtain financing or complete suitable acquisitions on acceptable terms and prices. Acquisition efforts entail a number of risks, including: diversion of management\u2019s attention; difficulties in integrating systems, operations and cultures; potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies; lack of experience operating in the geographic market of the acquired business; an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements; risks of entering into markets or producing products where we have limited or no experience; difficulties in integrating purchased technologies and products with our technologies and products; our ability to improve productivity and implement cost reductions; our ability to secure collective bargaining agreements with employees; and exposure to unanticipated liabilities.\nOur discovery of, or failure to discover, material issues during due diligence investigations of acquisition targets, either before closing with regard to potential risks of the acquired operations, or after closing with regard to the timely discovery of breaches of representations or warranties, or of certain indemnified environmental conditions, could seriously harm our business.\nCyber security risks could negatively affect operations and result in increased costs.\nOur Electronics Group, as a U.S. defense contractor, and our Company overall, face cyber security threats, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees and terrorist acts, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology failures and natural disasters.\nWe routinely experience cyber security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our sensitive information, as do our customers, suppliers and subcontractors. Prior cyber attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.\nAlthough we work cooperatively with our customers and our suppliers, subcontractors, and other partners to seek to minimize the impacts of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by those entities, and those safeguards might not be effective.\nThe costs related to cyber security or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our internal operations, the services we provide to customers, loss of competitive advantages derived from our research and development efforts, early obsolescence of our products and services, our future financial results, our reputation or our stock price.\nCompetition\nIncreasing competition could limit or reduce our market share.\nWe operate in highly competitive environments that include our customers\u2019 internal capabilities. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include the availability of manufacturing capacity, currency exchange rates (especially in low-cost countries), technological strength, speed and flexibility in responding to design or schedule changes, price, quality, delivery, cost management and financial strength. Our earnings could decline if our competitors or customers can provide comparable speed and quality at a lower cost, or if we fail to adequately invest in the range and quality of manufacturing services and products our customers require.\nSome of our competitors, as compared to us, are larger and have greater financial and organizational resources, geographic breadth and range of services, customer bases and brand recognition than we do. As a result, our competitors may respond more quickly to technological changes or customer needs, consume lower fixed and variable unit costs, negotiate reduced component prices, and obtain better terms for financing growth. If we fail to compete in any of these areas, we may lose market share and our business could be seriously harmed. There can be no assurance that we will not experience increased competition or that we will be able to maintain our profitability if our competitive environment changes.\nOur technologies could become obsolete, reducing our revenues and profitability.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by changing technology and continuing process development. The future of our business will depend in large part upon the continuing relevance of our technological capabilities. We could fail to make required capital investments, develop or successfully market services and products that meet changing customer needs and anticipate or respond to technological changes in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our inability to successfully launch or sustain new or next generation programs or product features, especially in accordance with budgets or committed delivery schedules, could materially adversely affect our financial results. We could encounter competition from new or revised technologies that render our technologies and equipment less profitable or obsolete in our chosen markets and our operating results may suffer. In particular, the Company is currently developing new products and pursuing new programs in an attempt to replenish the Electronics Group\u2019s revenue stream, which has been declining since 2009. However, commercializing the new products and programs is costly, has been slower than anticipated and is not expected to result in significant revenue in 2015. The launch of any new products or programs within the Electronics Group may not be successful.\nAccess to Capital\nAn inability to obtain new financing could require us to sell assets and could impair our ability to continue operations.\nAs previously disclosed, we amended our existing credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) in March 2015 in response to the changes in our business arising out of the loss of Dana as a customer. We are currently seeking to attempt to locate suitable debt financing to supplement or replace the Credit Facility on or prior to its maturity in January 2016. The amended Credit Facility requires us to make certain repayments through additional financing or the sale of marketable assets prior to maturity and includes other provisions designed to incentivize us to make early repayments to the lender, such as rising interest rates.\nThe timeframes during which we need to obtain such financing may make it more difficult to obtain on acceptable terms. Without the addition of junior capital, we do not believe conventional bank lending will be available to us in the near-term due to the recent loss of Dana revenues, among other factors. If additional financing is obtained in the form of debt, the terms of the debt could place restrictions on our ability to operate or increase the financial risk of our capital structure. Additional equity financing or debt financing with an equity component (such as warrants) could result in dilution to existing holders.\nOur ability to borrow under the Credit Facility is conditioned upon our compliance with various financial covenants. If we fail to meet those covenants, it could accelerate our need to obtain alternative financing. If unsuccessful, we may need to raise capital through the sale of core or non-core assets or businesses, and our inability to do so could materially adversely impact our operating results, financial results or ability to continue operations.\nOur ability to finance expansion or new business opportunities may be limited.\nOur future liquidity and capital requirements depend on numerous factors other than bank borrowings or debt financing, including the pace at which we can replace the loss of Dana revenues. One method we have historically used to increase our revenues and obtain multi-year supply agreements is to buy a customer\u2019s non-core manufacturing assets and produce products for them. We may not be able to raise funds necessary to pursue this strategy under our existing and future debt agreements which could further limit our ability to replace the loss of revenues.\nWe may be unable to comply with the covenants in our amended Credit Facility.\nThe financial covenants in our amended Credit Facility require us to achieve certain financial and other business results. In March 2015, certain covenants were amended to allow for current and future compliance. A failure to comply with these or other covenants could, if we were unable to obtain a waiver or another amendment of the covenant terms, cause an event of default that would cause our debt under the Credit Facility to become immediately due and payable. We have also agreed to repay a portion of our loan balances by September 30, 2015 in the event that such amount is not raised either through additional subordinated debt or the sale of collateral. Our failure or inability to do so in accordance with our amended Credit Facility could cause an event of default that would cause the debt under the Credit Facility to become immediately due and payable. In the event that our outstanding debt under the Credit Facility was declared immediately due and payable, we may be required to sell assets which could impair our ability to continue operations.\nLabor Relations\nWe must attract and retain qualified employees while successfully managing related costs.\nOur future success in a changing business environment, including during rapid changes in the size, complexity or skills required of our workforce, as we are experiencing in connection with the recent loss of Dana revenues, will depend to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of our executive, managerial and technical employees. The loss of key employees, especially in a recovering economic environment, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our future success will also require an ability to attract and retain qualified employees, especially those with engineering or production expertise in our core business lines. Labor disputes or changes in the cost of providing pension and other employee benefits, including changes in health care costs, investment returns on plan assets and discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities or other requirements to accelerate the level of our pension fund contributions to reduce or eliminate underfunded liabilities, could lead to increased costs or disruptions of operations in any of our business units.\nDisputes with labor unions could disrupt our business plans.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 683 employees (all of which were in the Industrial Group), or 51% of total employees. Excluding certain Mexico employees covered under an annually ratified agreement, there are no collective bargaining agreements that expire within the next 12 months. Certain Mexico employees are covered by an annually ratified collective bargaining agreement. These employees represented approximately 36% of the Company\u2019s workforce, or 474 employees at year end. In response to the loss of significant revenues from Dana, traditionally our largest customer, we have engaged in layoffs during the first quarter of 2015 and our ability to maintain our workforce depends on our ability to attract and retain new and existing customers. We could experience a work stoppage or other disputes which could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and could harm our operating results.\nRegulatory\nEnvironmental, health and safety risks could expose us to potential liability.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals and substances used in our operations. If we fail to comply with present or future regulations, we could be forced to alter, suspend or discontinue our manufacturing processes and pay substantial fines or penalties.\nGroundwater and other contamination has occurred at certain of our current and former facilities during the operation of those facilities by their former owners, and this contamination may occur at future facilities we operate or acquire. There is no assurance that environmental indemnification agreements we have secured from former owners of these properties will be adequate to protect us from liability.\nThe Marion, Ohio property formerly owned by Sypris is subject to soil and groundwater contamination involving petroleum compounds, semi-volatile and volatile organic compounds, certain metals, PCBs and other contaminants, some of which exceed the state voluntary action program standards applicable to the site. The property was sold in March 2013 to Whirlpool Corporation (Whirlpool). Whirlpool has indemnified the Company against the legacy environmental risks on the property.\nWe previously acquired certain business assets formerly located at a leased facility in Littleton, Colorado, where chlorinated solvents had been disposed of on site by a prior owner of the business at the site, contaminating the groundwater at and around the site. The seller of the assets to us is operating a remediation system on the site approved by the State of Colorado and has entered into a consent order with the EPA providing for additional investigation at the site. In addition, Sypris has been contractually indemnified by the prior owners of the facility.\nOur Morganton, North Carolina facility is subject to soil and groundwater contamination involving petroleum compounds, certain metals and other contaminants, some of which may exceed the State of North Carolina standards applicable to the site. The Company is aware of no current litigation, material remediation claims or other proceedings with respect to this facility.\nOur Toluca, Mexico facility is subject to soil and groundwater contamination involving petroleum compounds and volatile organic compounds, among other concerns. We continue to test and assess this site to determine the extent of any contamination by the prior owners of the facility. Under our purchase agreement for this facility, Dana has agreed to indemnify us for, among other things, environmental conditions that existed on the site as of closing and as to which we notified Dana prior to June 30, 2006, subject to certain other conditions involving Dana\u2019s release of, or continuing right to seek indemnity from, Eaton, from which Dana acquired the property.\nThe Kenton, Ohio property formerly owned by Sypris is subject to soil and groundwater contamination involving petroleum compounds, volatile organic compounds, certain metals, PCBs and other contaminants. Under our purchase agreement for this property, Meritor agreed to indemnify us for, among other things, environmental conditions that existed on the site as of closing and as to which we notified Meritor prior to May 2, 2006. The building and real property were sold in January 2012.\nOur business is also subject to potential liabilities with respect to health and safety matters. We are required to comply with federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the health and safety of our workforce, and we could be held liable for damages arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other dangerous working conditions. Health and safety laws and regulations are complex and change frequently. As a result, our future costs to comply with such laws or the liabilities incurred in the event of any violations may increase significantly.\nAdverse regulatory developments or litigation could harm our business.\nOur businesses operate in heavily regulated environments. We must successfully manage the risk of changes in or adverse actions under applicable law or in our regulatory authorizations, licenses and permits, governmental security clearances or other legal rights to operate our businesses, to manage our work force or to import and export goods and services as needed. Our business activities expose us to the risks of litigation with respect to our customers, suppliers, creditors, stockholders or from product liability, environmental or asbestos-related matters. We also face the risk of other adverse regulatory actions, compliance costs or governmental sanctions, as well as the costs and risks related to our ongoing efforts to design and implement effective internal controls.\nOther Risks\nWe face other factors which could seriously disrupt our operations.\nMany other risk factors beyond our control could seriously disrupt our operations, including: risks relating to war, future terrorist activities, computer hacking or other cyber attacks, or political uncertainties; risks relating to natural disasters or other casualties which could shut down our domestic or foreign facilities, disrupt transportation of products or supplies, increase the costs under our self insurance program or change the timing and availability of funding in our aerospace and defense electronics markets; risks inherent in operating abroad, including foreign currency exchange rates, adverse regulatory developments, and miscommunications or errors due to inaccurate foreign language translations or currency exchange rates; or our failure to anticipate or to adequately insure against other risks and uncertainties present in our businesses including unknown or unidentified risks.", "PERMNO": 80534, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "SYPR"}
