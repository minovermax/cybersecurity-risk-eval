{"cik": "1023364", "company": "AUTOBYTEL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below are not the only risks that we face. The following risks as well as risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, earnings per share, cash flow or the trading price of our stock, individually and collectively referred to in these Risk Factors as our \u201cfinancial performance.\u201d See also the discussion of \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d immediately preceding Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may be unable to increase Vehicle Lead revenues and could suffer a decline in revenues due to dealer attrition.\nWe derive more than 90% of our revenues from Vehicle Lead fees paid by Dealers and Manufacturers participating in our Lead programs. Our ability to increase revenues from sales of Vehicle Leads is dependent on a mix of interrelated factors that include increasing Vehicle Lead revenues by attracting and retaining Dealers and Manufacturers, increasing the number of high quality Vehicle Leads we sell to Dealers and Manufacturers, and improving margins by increasing the number of Internally-Generated Leads that we sell to our customers. We are also focused on higher revenue Dealers that are more cost-effective to support. Our sales strategy is intended to result in more profitable relationships with our Dealers both in terms of cost to supply Leads and to support the Dealers. Dealer churn impacts our revenues, and if our sales strategy does not mitigate the loss in revenues by maintaining the overall number of Leads sold by increasing sales to other Dealers or Manufacturers while maintaining the overall margins we receive from the Leads sold, our revenues would decrease. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to prevent Dealer attrition or to offset the revenues lost due to Dealer attrition by other means, and our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe may lose customers or quality Lead supplies to our competitors.\nOur ability to provide increased numbers of high quality Leads to our customers is dependent on increasing the number of Internally-Generated Leads and acquiring high quality Non-Internally-Generated Leads from third parties. Originating Internally-Generated Leads is dependent on our ability to increase consumer traffic to our Company Websites by providing secure and easy to use websites with relevant and quality content for consumers and increasing visibility of our brands to consumers and by our SEM activities. We compete for Dealer and Manufacturer customers and for acquisition of Non-Internally-Generated Leads with companies that maintain automotive Lead referral businesses that are very similar to ours. Several of these competitors are larger than us and may have greater financial resources than we have. If we lose customers or quality Lead supply volume to our competitors, or if our pricing or cost to acquire Leads is impacted, our financial performance will be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur financial performance could be negatively affected by changes in Internet search engine algorithms and dynamics.\nWe use Google to generate a significant portion of the traffic to our websites, and, to a lesser extent, we use other search engines and meta-search websites to generate traffic to our websites, principally through pay-per-click advertising campaigns. The pricing and operating dynamics on these search engines can experience rapid change commercially, technically and competitively. For example, Google frequently updates and changes the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a consumer's search, such that the placement of links to our websites can be negatively affected and our costs to improve or maintain our placement in search results can increase.\nWe are affected by general economic and market conditions, and, in particular, conditions in the automotive industry.\nOur financial performance is affected by general economic and market factors, conditions in the automotive industry, and the market for automotive marketing services, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf\nThe effect of unemployment on the number of vehicle purchasers;\n\u25cf\nPricing and purchase incentives for vehicles;\n\u25cf\nThe expectation that consumers will be purchasing fewer vehicles overall during their lifetime as a result of better quality vehicles and longer warranties;\n\u25cf\nThe impact of fuel prices on demand for the number and types of vehicles;\n\u25cf\nIncreases or decreases in the number of retail Dealers or in the number of Manufacturers and other wholesale customers in our customer base;\n\u25cf\nVolatility in spending by Manufacturers and others in their marketing budgets and allocations; and\n\u25cf\nThe competitive impact of consolidation in the online automotive referral industry.\nWe may acquire other companies, and there are many risks associated with acquisitions.\nAs part of our business strategy we evaluate potential acquisitions that we believe will complement or enhance our existing business. We currently do not have any definitive agreements to acquire any company or business, and we may not be able to identify or complete any acquisition in the future. Acquisitions involve numerous risks that include the following, any of which could materially and adversely affect our financial performance:\n\u25cf\nWe may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or may not realize them in the timeframe expected, including due to acquisitions where we expand into product and service offerings or enter or expand into markets in which we are not experienced.\n\u25cf\nIn order to complete acquisitions, we may issue common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, potentially creating dilution for existing stockholders. Issuance of equity securities may also restrict utilization of net operating loss carryforwards because of an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations under the Internal Revenue Code.\n\u25cf\nWe may borrow to finance acquisitions, and the amount and terms of any potential future acquisition-related or other borrowings may not be favorable to the Company and could affect our liquidity and financial condition.\n\u25cf\nAcquisitions may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings, including those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, goodwill and asset impairment charges, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, assumed litigation and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans.\n\u25cf\nOur due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with an acquired company that may result in unexpected or increased costs, expenses or liabilities that could make an acquisition less profitable or unprofitable.\n\u25cf\nThe failure to further our strategic objectives that may require us to expend additional resources to develop products, services and technology internally.\n\u25cf\nAn announced business combination and investment transaction may not close timely or at all, which may cause our financial results to differ from expectations in a given quarter.\n\u25cf\nBusiness combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation that can be costly to defend or settle, even if no actual liability exists.\n\u25cf\nIntegration of acquisitions are often complex, time-consuming and expensive and if not successfully integrated could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. The challenges involved with integration of acquisitions include:\n\u25cf\nDiversion of management attention to assimilating the acquired business from other business operations and concerns.\n\u25cf\nIntegration of management information and accounting systems of the acquired business into our systems, and the failure to fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of an acquisition.\n\u25cf\nDifficulties in assimilating the operations and personnel of an acquired business into our own business.\n\u25cf\nDifficulties in integrating management information and accounting systems of an acquired business into our current systems.\n\u25cf\nConvincing our customers and suppliers and the customers and suppliers of the acquired business that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus and that they should not defer purchasing decisions or switch to other suppliers.\n\u25cf\nConsolidating and rationalizing corporate IT infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code and business processes.\n\u25cf\nPersuading employees that business cultures are compatible, maintaining employee morale, retaining key employees and integrating employees into the Company.\n\u25cf\nCoordinating and combining administrative, manufacturing, research and development and other operations, subsidiaries, facilities and relationships with third parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures.\n\u25cf\nManaging integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions.\nConcentration of credit risk and risks due to significant customers could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are primarily maintained with two financial institutions in the United States. Deposits held by banks exceed the amount of insurance provided for such deposits. Generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand. Accounts receivable are primarily derived from fees billed to Dealers and Manufacturers. We have a concentration of credit risk with our automotive industry related accounts receivable balances, particularly with Urban Science Applications (which represents several Manufacturer programs), General Motors and Ford Direct. During 2015 approximately 28% of the Company\u2019s total revenues were derived from these customers, and approximately 37% or $10.7 million of gross accounts receivable are receivable from them at December 31, 2015. In 2015, Urban Science Applications accounted for 16% of total revenues and accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015, respectively. No collateral is required to support our accounts receivables, and we maintain an allowance for bad debts for potential credit losses. If there is a decline in the general economic environment that negatively affects the financial condition of our customers or an increase in the number of customers that are dissatisfied with their services, additional estimated allowances for bad debts and customer credits may be required, and the adverse impact on our financial performance could be material.\nWe depend on Manufacturers through our third party sales channel for a significant amount of our advertising revenues, and we may not be able to maintain or grow these relationships.\nWe depend on Manufacturers through our third party sales channel for a significant amount of our advertising revenues. A decline in the level of advertising on our websites, reductions in advertising rates or any significant failure to develop additional sources of advertising would cause our advertising revenues to decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. We periodically negotiate revisions to existing agreements and these revisions could decrease our advertising revenues in future periods and a number of our advertising agreements with Manufacturers may be terminated at any time without cause. We may not be able to maintain our relationship with Manufacturers on favorable terms or find alternative comparable relationships capable of replacing advertising revenues on terms satisfactory to us. If we cannot do so, our advertising revenues would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur ability to maintain and add to our relationships with advertisers and thereby increase advertising revenues is dependent on our ability to attract consumers and acquire traffic to our Company Websites and monetize that traffic at profitable margins with advertisers. Our consumer facing websites compete with offerings from the major internet portals, transaction based sites, automotive-related verticals (websites with content that is primarily automotive in nature) and numerous lifestyle websites. Our advertising business is characterized by minimal barriers to entry, and new competitors may be able to launch competitive services at relatively low costs. If our websites do not provide a compelling, differentiated user experience, we may lose visitors to competing sites, and if our website traffic declines, we may lose relevance to our major advertisers who may reduce or eliminate their advertising buys from us.\nUncertainty exists in the application of various laws and regulations to our business. New laws or regulations applicable to our business, or expansion or interpretation of existing laws and regulations to apply to our business, could subject us to licensing, claims, judgments and remedies, including monetary liabilities and limitations on our business practices, and could increase administrative costs or materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe operate in a regulatory climate in which there is uncertainty as to the application of various laws and regulations to our business. Our business could be significantly affected by different interpretations or applications of existing laws or regulations, future laws or regulations, or actions or rulings by judicial or regulatory authorities. Our operations may be subjected to adoption, expansion or interpretation of various laws and regulations, and compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to obtain licenses at an undeterminable and possibly significant initial and annual expense. These additional expenditures may increase future overhead, thereby potentially reducing our future results of operations. There can be no assurances that future laws or regulations or interpretations or expansions of existing laws or regulations will not impose requirements on internet commerce that could substantially impair the growth of e-commerce and adversely affect our financial performance. The adoption of additional laws or regulations may decrease the popularity or impede the expansion of e-commerce and internet marketing, restrict our present business practices, require us to implement costly compliance procedures or expose us and/or our customers to potential liability.\nWe may be considered to \u201coperate\u201d or \u201cdo business\u201d in states where our customers conduct their business, resulting in regulatory action. If any state licensing laws were determined to be applicable to us, and if we are required to be licensed and we are unable to do so, or we are otherwise unable to comply with laws or regulations, we could be subject to fines or other penalties or be compelled to discontinue operations in those states. In the event any state\u2019s regulatory requirements impose state specific requirements on us or include us within an industry-specific regulatory scheme, we may be required to modify our marketing programs in that state in a manner that may undermine the program\u2019s attractiveness to consumers or Dealers. In the alternative, if we determine that the licensing and related requirements are overly burdensome, we may elect to terminate operations in that state. In each case, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. We have identified below areas of government regulation, which if changed or interpreted to apply to our business, we believe could be costly for us.\nAutomotive Dealer/ Broker and Vehicle Advertising Laws. All states comprehensively regulate vehicle sales and lease transactions, including strict licensure requirements for Dealers (and, in some states, brokers) and vehicle advertising. Most of these laws and regulations, we believe, specifically address only traditional vehicle purchase and lease transactions, not internet-based Lead referral programs such as our programs. If we determine that the licensing or other regulatory requirements in a given state are applicable to us or to a particular marketing services program, we may elect to obtain required licenses and comply with applicable regulatory requirements. However, if licensing or other regulatory requirements are overly burdensome, we may elect to terminate operations or particular marketing services programs in that state or elect to not operate or introduce particular marketing services programs in that state. In some states we have modified our marketing programs or pricing models to reduce uncertainty regarding our compliance with local laws. As we introduce new services, we may need to incur additional costs associated with additional licensing regulations and regulatory requirements.\nFinancial Broker and Consumer Credit Laws. We provide a connection through our websites that allows consumers to obtain finance information and submit Leads for vehicle financing to third party lenders. We also acquire finance-related Leads from third parties. We receive marketing fees from financial institutions and Dealers in connection with this marketing activity. We do not demand nor do we receive any fees from consumers for this service. In the event states require us to be licensed as a financial broker, we may be unable to comply with a state\u2019s laws or regulations, or we could be required to incur significant fees and expenses to obtain any financial broker required license and comply with regulatory requirements. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act established a new consumer financial protection bureau with broad regulatory powers, which could lead to regulation of our Finance Lead business directly or indirectly through regulation of automotive finance companies and other financial institutions.\nInsurance Broker Laws. We provide links on our websites and referrals from call centers enabling consumers to be referred to third parties to receive quotes for insurance and extended warranty coverage from such third parties. All online applications for quotes are completed on the respective insurance carriers\u2019 or other third party websites, and all applications for quotes obtained through call center referrals are conducted by the insurance carrier or other third party. We receive marketing fees from participants in connection with this marketing activity. We do not receive any premiums from consumers nor do we charge consumers fees for our services.\nChanges in the taxation of internet commerce may result in increased costs.\nBecause our business is dependent on the internet, the adoption of new local, state or federal tax laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations by governmental authorities may subject us to additional local, state or federal sales, use or income taxes and could decrease the growth of internet usage or marketing or the acceptance of internet commerce which could, in turn, decrease the demand for our services and increase our costs. As a result, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. Tax authorities in a number of states are currently reviewing and re-evaluating the tax treatment of companies engaged in internet commerce, including the application of sales taxes to internet marketing businesses similar to ours. We accrue for tax contingencies based upon our estimate of the taxes ultimately expected to be paid, which we update over time as more information becomes available, new legislation or rules are adopted or taxing authorities interpret their existing statutes and rules to apply to internet commerce, including internet marketing businesses similar to ours. The amounts ultimately paid in resolution of reviews or audits by taxing authorities could be materially different from the amounts we have accrued and result in additional tax expense, and our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected.\nData Security and Privacy Risks\nOur business is subject to various laws, rules and regulations relating to data security and privacy. New data security and privacy laws, rules and regulations may be adopted regarding the internet or other online services that could limit our business flexibility or cause us to incur higher compliance costs. In each case, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. We have identified below some of these risks that we believe could be costly for us.\nAnti-spam laws, rules and regulations. Various state and federal laws, rules and regulations regulate email communications and internet advertising and restrict or prohibit unsolicited email (commonly known as \u201cspam\u201d). These laws, rules or regulations may adversely affect our ability to market our services to consumers in a cost-effective manner. The federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (\u201cCAN-SPAM\u201d) imposes complex and often burdensome requirements in connection with sending commercial emails. In addition, state laws regulating the sending of commercial emails, including California\u2019s law regulating the sending of commercial emails, to the extent found to not be preempted by CAN-SPAM, may impose requirements or conditions more restrictive than CAN-SPAM. Violation of these laws, rules or regulations may result in monetary fines or penalties or damage to our reputation.\nData privacy laws, rules and regulations. Various laws, rules and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we receive from our users, advertisers and affiliates. In addition, we have and post on our website our own privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data and personal information. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, Federal Trade Commission requirements or orders or other federal or state privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations or industry self-regulatory principles could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Further, failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our policies, applicable requirements or industry self-regulatory principles related to the collection, use, sharing or security of personal information or other privacy-related matters could result in a loss of user confidence in us, damage to our brands, and ultimately in a loss of users, advertisers or Lead referral and advertising affiliates. We cannot predict whether new legislation or regulations concerning data privacy and retention issues related to our business will be adopted, or if adopted, whether they could impose requirements that may result in a decrease in our user registrations and materially and adversely affect our financial performance. Proposals that have or that are currently being considered include restrictions relating to the collection and use of data and information obtained through the tracking of internet use, including the possible implementation of a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d list, that would allow internet users to opt-out of such tracking.\nSecurity risks associated with online Leads collection and referral, advertising and e-commerce risks associated with other online fraud and scams. A significant issue for online businesses like ours is the secure transmission of confidential and personal information over public networks. Concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy issues have been significant barriers to growth in consumer use of the internet, online advertising and e-commerce. Despite our implementation of security measures, our computer systems or those of our vendors may be susceptible to electronic or physical computer break-ins, viruses and other disruptive harms and security breaches. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may specifically compromise our security measures. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding website visitors, whether through breach of our network by an unauthorized party, employee theft or misuse, or otherwise, could harm our reputation and brands, substantially impair our ability to attract and retain our audiences, or subject us to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by consumers. If consumers experience identity theft after using any of our websites, we may be exposed to liability, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation. To the extent that identity theft gives rise to reluctance to use our websites or a decline in consumer confidence in financial transactions over the internet, our business could be adversely affected. Alleged or actual breaches of the network of one of our business partners or competitors whom consumers associate with us could also harm our reputation and brands. In addition, we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of state, federal and foreign laws regarding the unauthorized disclosure of personal information. For example, California law requires companies to inform individuals of any security breaches that result in their personal information being stolen. Because our success depends on the acceptance of online services and e-commerce, we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by those breaches. Internet fraud has been increasing over the past few years, and the Company has experienced fraudulent use of our name and trademarks on websites in connection with the purported sale of vehicles offered on third party websites, with payments to be handled through an online escrow service purported to be owned and operated by the Company. These fraudulent online transactions and scams, should they continue to increase in prevalence, could affect our reputation with consumers and give rise to claims by consumers for funds transferred to the fraudulent accounts, which could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are insured for some, but not all, of the foregoing risks. Even for those risks for which we are insured and have coverage under the terms and conditions of the applicable policies, there are no assurances given that the coverage limits would be sufficient to cover all costs, liabilities or losses we might incur or experience.\nTelemarketing Risks. We are subject to various federal and state laws, rules, regulations and orders regarding telemarketing and privacy, including restrictions on the use of unsolicited emails and restrictions on marketing activities conducted through the use of telephonic communications (including text messaging to mobile telephones). Our financial performance could be adversely affected by newly-adopted or amended laws, rules, regulations and orders relating to telemarketing and increased enforcement of such laws, rules, regulations or orders by governmental agencies or by private litigants. One example of regulatory changes that may affect our financial performance are the regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cTCPA\u201d). Regulations adopted by the Federal Communications Commission under the TCPA require the prior express written consent of the called party before a caller can initiate telemarketing calls (i) to wireless numbers (including text messaging) using an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice; or (ii) to residential lines using an artificial or prerecorded voice. Failure to comply with the TCPA can result in significant penalties, including statutory damages. Our efforts to comply with these regulations may negatively affect conversion rates of leads, and thus, our revenue or profitability.\nTechnology Risks\nOur business is dependent on keeping pace with advances in technology. If we are unable to keep pace with advances in technology, consumers may stop using our services and our revenues will decrease. If we are required to invest substantial amounts in technology, our financial performance will be adversely impacted. The internet and electronic commerce markets are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in user and customer requirements, frequent new service and product introductions embodying new technologies, including mobile internet applications, and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our existing websites and technology obsolete. These market characteristics are intensified by the emerging nature of the market and the fact that many companies are expected to introduce new internet products and services in the near future. If we are unable to adapt to changing technologies, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. Our performance will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance our existing services, develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers, license leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis. The development of our websites, mobile applications and other proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks. We may not be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our websites or other proprietary technology to customer requirements or to emerging industry standards. In addition, if we are required to invest substantial amounts in technology in order to keep pace with technological advances, our financial performance could suffer.\nInterruptions or failures in our information technology platforms, communication systems or security systems could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. Our information technology and communications systems are susceptible to outages and interruptions due to fire, flood, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failures, cyber attacks, terrorist attacks, failure of redundant systems and disaster recovery plans and similar events. Such outages and interruptions could damage our reputation and harm our operating results. Despite our network security measures, our information technology platforms are vulnerable to computer viruses, worms, physical and electronic break-ins, sabotage and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering, as well as coordinated denial-of-service attacks. We do not have multiple site capacity for all of our services. In the event of delays or disruptions to services we rely on third party providers to perform disaster recovery planning and services on our behalf. We are vulnerable to extended failures to the extent that planning and services are not adequate to meet our continued technology platform, communication or security systems\u2019 needs. We rely on third party providers for our primary and secondary internet connections. Our co-location service and public cloud services that provide infrastructure and platform services, environmental and power support for our technology platforms, communication systems and security systems are received from third party providers. We have little or no control over these third party providers. Any disruption of the services they provide us or any failure of these third party providers to effectively design and implement sufficient security systems or plan for increases in capacity could, in turn, cause delays or disruptions in our services. We are insured for some, but not all, of these events. Even for those events for which we are insured and have coverage under the terms and conditions of the applicable policies, there are no assurances given that the coverage limits would be sufficient to cover all losses we might incur or experience.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with overseas operations and outsourcing. We currently maintain website, software development and operations in Guatemala that we acquired in our acquisition of AutoWeb and receive software development and maintenance services for some of our systems from contractors located in Pakistan. These overseas operations and contractor arrangements are subject to many inherent risks, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nPolitical, social and economic instability;\n\u25cf\nExposure to different business practices and legal standards, particularly with respect to labor and employment laws and intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nContinuation of overseas conflicts and the risk of terrorist attacks and resulting heightened security;\n\u25cf\nThe imposition of governmental controls and restrictions and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\nTheft and other crimes;\n\u25cf\nNationalization of business and blocking of cash flows;\n\u25cf\nChanges in taxation and tariffs;\n\u25cf\nDifficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and\n\u25cf\nForeign currency exchange fluctuations.\nThese risks can significantly impact our overseas operations and outsourcing and increase the cost of such operations and outsourcing, resulting in a material and adverse impact on our financial performance. In addition, we are subject to certain anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Pr actices Act, in addition to the laws of the foreign countries in which we operate. If any of our overseas operations, or our employees or agents, violates such laws, we could become subject to sanctions or significant penalties that could negatively affect our reputation and financial performance.\nSecurities Market Risks\nThe public market for our common stock may be volatile, especially because market prices for internet-related and technology stocks have often been unrelated to operating performance; our common stock could be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market if we are not able to satisfy continued listing requirements, in which case the price of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital and issue equity-based compensation may be adversely affected, and the ability to buy and sell our stock may be less orderly and efficient. Our common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cABTL,\u201d but we cannot assure that an active trading market will be sustained or that the market price of the common stock will not decline. The stock market in general periodically experiences significant price fluctuations. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as:\n\u25cf\nActual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf\nHistorical and anticipated operating metrics such as the number of participating Dealers, volume of Lead deliveries to Dealers, the number of visitors to Company Websites and the frequency with which they interact with Company Websites;\n\u25cf\nAnnouncements of new product or service offerings;\n\u25cf\nTechnological innovations;\n\u25cf\nLow trading volumes;\n\u25cf\nConcentration of holdings in our common stock resulting in low public float for our shares;\n\u25cf\nDecisions by holders of large blocks of our stock to sell their holdings on accelerated time schedules, including by reason of their decision to liquidate investment funds that hold our stock;\n\u25cf\nLimited analyst coverage of the Company;\n\u25cf\nCompetitive developments, including actions by Manufacturers;\n\u25cf\nChanges in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to meet such estimates;\n\u25cf\nConditions and trends in the internet, electronic commerce and automotive industries;\n\u25cf\nAdoption of new accounting standards affecting the technology or automotive industry;\n\u25cf\nRumors, whether or not accurate, about us, our industry or possible transactions or other events;\n\u25cf\nThe impact of open market repurchases of our common stock; and\n\u25cf\nGeneral market or economic conditions and other factors.\nFurther, the stock markets, and in particular The Nasdaq Capital Market, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies and have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market factors have affected and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rates, energy prices, international currency fluctuations, terrorist acts, political revolutions, military actions or wars, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies with publicly traded securities. This litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nFor our common stock to continue to be listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, the Company must satisfy various continued listing requirements established by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d). In the event the Company were not able to satisfy these continued listing requirements, we expect that our common stock would be quoted on an over-the-counter market. These markets are generally considered to be less efficient and less broad than The Nasdaq Capital Market. Investors may be reluctant to invest in the common stock if it is not listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market or another stock exchange. Delisting of our common stock could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and would also eliminate our ability to rely on the preemption of state securities registration and qualification requirements afforded by Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1933 for \u201ccovered securities.\u201d The loss of this preemption could result in higher costs for capital raising, could limit resale of our stock in some states, and could adversely impact our ability to issue equity-based compensation to Company employees.\nNo assurances can be given that the Company will continue to be able to meet the continued listing requirements for listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nRisks Associated with Litigation\nMisappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property and proprietary rights, enforcement actions to protect our intellectual property and claims from third parties relating to intellectual property could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. Litigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the internet and technology industries. We expect that internet technologies and software products and services may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Our ability to compete depends upon our proprietary systems and technology. While we rely on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright law, confidentiality agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights, we believe that the technical and creative skills of our personnel, continued development of our proprietary systems and technology, brand name recognition and reliable website maintenance are more essential in establishing and maintaining a leadership position and strengthening our brands. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult and may be expensive. We have no assurance that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable. Effective trademark, service mark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available when our products and services are made available online. In addition, if litigation becomes necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity, this litigation, even if successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. We also have no assurances that our products and services do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. Claims of infringement, even if unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. If we are not successful, we may be subject to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and monetary damages which may be trebled in the case willful infringements.\nWe could be adversely affected by actions of third parties that could subject us to litigation that could significantly and adversely affect our financial performance. We could face liability for information retrieved or obtained from or transmitted over the internet by third parties and liability for products sold over the internet by third parties. We could be exposed to liability with respect to third party information that may be accessible through our websites, links or vehicle review services. These claims might, for example, be made for defamation, negligence, patent, copyright or trademark infringement, personal injury, breach of contract, unfair competition, false advertising, invasion of privacy or other legal theories based on the nature, content or copying of these materials. These claims might assert, among other things that, by directly or indirectly providing links to websites operated by third parties we should be liable for copyright or trademark infringement or other wrongful actions by such third parties through those websites. It is also possible that, if any third party content provided on our websites contains errors, consumers could make claims against us for losses incurred in reliance on such information. Any claims could result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, cause delays in releasing new or upgrading existing services or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\nWe also enter into agreements with other companies under which any revenues that results from the purchase or use of services through direct links to or from our websites or on our websites is shared. In addition, we acquire personal information and data in the form of Leads purchased from third party websites involving consumers who submitted personally identifiable information and data to the third parties and not directly to us. These arrangements may expose us to additional legal risks and uncertainties, including disputes with these parties regarding revenue sharing, local, state and federal government regulation and potential liabilities to consumers of these services, even if we do not provide the services ourselves or have direct contact with the consumer. These liabilities can include liability for violations by these third parties of laws, rules and regulations, including those related to data security and privacy laws and regulations; unsolicited email, text messaging, telephone or wireless voice marketing; and licensing. We have no assurance that any indemnification provided to us in our agreements with these third parties, if available, will be adequate.\nWe could be materially and adversely affected by other litigation. From time to time, we are involved in litigation or legal matters not related to intellectual property rights and arising from the normal course of our business activities. The actions filed against us and other litigation or legal matters, even if not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention and an adverse outcome in litigation could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. Our liability insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, tax benefit preservation plan and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a third party from acquiring us or limit the price third parties are willing to pay for our stock.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws relating to our corporate governance and provisions in our Tax Benefit Preservation Plan could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, and could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. The issuance of preferred stock also could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of the common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows us to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without any further vote or action by the stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the board of directors is divided into three classes, which may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or change in our management because less than a majority of the board of directors are up for election at each annual meeting. In addition, provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u25cf\nRequire that actions to be taken by our stockholders may be taken only at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u25cf\nSpecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, a committee of the board of directors, the Chairman of our board of directors or our President;\n\u25cf\nEstablish advance notice procedures for stockholders to submit nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors and other proposals to be brought before a stockholders meeting;\n\u25cf\nProvide that our bylaws may be amended by our board of directors without stockholder approval;\n\u25cf\nAllow our board of directors to establish the size of our board of directors;\n\u25cf\nProvide that vacancies on our board of directors or newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of our directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and\n\u25cf\nDo not give the holders of our common stock cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of directors.\nThese provisions could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect corporate actions such as a merger, asset sale or other change of control of us.\nUnder our Tax Benefit Preservation Plan, rights to purchase capital stock of the Company (\u201cRights\u201d) have been distributed as a dividend at the rate of five Rights for each share of common stock. Each Right entitles its holder, upon triggering of the Rights, to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Company at a price of $75.00 (as such price may be adjusted under the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan) or, in certain circumstances, to instead acquire shares of common stock. The Rights will convert into a right to acquire common stock or other capital stock of the Company in certain circumstances and subject to certain exceptions. The Rights will be triggered upon the acquisition of 4.90% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock or future acquisitions by any existing holders of 4.90% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock. If a person or group acquires 4.90% or more of our common stock, all Rights holders, except the acquirer, will be entitled to acquire at the then exercise price of a Right that number of shares of our common stock which, at the time, has a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. The Tax Benefit Preservation Plan authorizes our board of directors to exercise discretionary authority to deem a person acquiring common stock in excess of 4.90% not to be an \u201cAcquiring Person\u201d under the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan, and thereby not trigger the Rights, if the Board finds that the beneficial ownership of the shares by the person acquiring the shares will not be likely to directly or indirectly limit the availability to the Company of the net operating loss carryovers and other tax attributes that the plan is intended to preserve or is otherwise in the best interests of the Company.\nWe are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, the statute prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. For purposes of Section 203, a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d includes a merger, asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder, and an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns or did own 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock. Section 203 could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us.\nIf our internal controls and procedures fail, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In making its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, management used the criteria described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.\nManagement determined that we had no material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. Our internal controls may not prevent all potential errors and fraud, because any control system, no matter how well designed, can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. We have had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the past and there is no assurance that we will not have one or more material weaknesses in the future resulting from failure of our internal controls and procedures. Management excluded from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting the Dealix/Autotegrity and AutoWeb businesses acquired during 2015.\nOur ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis could be adversely affected by a failure in our internal control over financial reporting. If our financial statements are not fairly presented, investors may not have an accurate understanding of our operating results and financial condition. If our financial statements are not timely filed with the SEC, we could be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market. If either or both of these events occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and the market price of our common stock. In addition, a failure in our internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nIf we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract, train and retain additional highly qualified sales, marketing, managerial and technical personnel, our business may suffer.\nOur future success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain highly qualified sales, marketing, managerial and technical personnel. In addition, as we introduce new services we may need to hire additional personnel. We may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain such personnel in the future. The inability to attract and retain the necessary managerial, technical, sales and marketing personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. Each of these executive officers would be difficult to replace. There is no guarantee that these or any of our other executive officers and key employees will remain employed with us. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 86763, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "AUTO"}
