RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nThere are a number of factors, including those specified below, that may adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s business, financial results or stock price. Additional risks that the Corporation currently does not know about or currently views as immaterial may also impair the Corporation\u2019s business or adversely impact its financial results or stock price.\nOperational Risks\n\u2022The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread have adversely impacted the Corporation\u2019s business and financial results, and the continued impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the severity and duration of the pandemic and further actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties to contain and treat the virus.\nCOVID-19, which has been identified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization and declared a national emergency in the United States, continues to significantly impact the global economy (including the states and local economies in which we operate) and create significant volatility and disruption in financial markets. The outbreak has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place or total lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns. Such measures have significantly contributed to rising unemployment and negatively impacted consumer and business spending. As a result, the demand for the Corporation\u2019s products and services has been, and will continue to be, significantly impacted. Furthermore, the pandemic has caused, and could continue to influence, the recognition of credit losses in the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolios and increases in the Corporation\u2019s allowance for credit losses as our customers are negatively impacted by the economic downturn. In addition, governmental actions have resulted in decreased interest rates and yields, which may lead to decreases in the Corporation\u2019s net interest income.\nAs our banking regulators have encouraged us to work prudently with borrowers who are unable to meet their contractual payment obligations due to the effects of COVID-19, the Bank has implemented certain hardship relief programs (including payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, and other delays in payment). As a result, the Bank has made numerous short-term loan modifications for customers who are current and otherwise not past due. As provided under the CARES Act and extended by the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act, these qualified loan modifications are currently exempt by law from classification as troubled debt restructures as defined by GAAP. The potential adverse impact resulting from the inability of customers to repay loans on a timely basis cannot be determined at this time. However, the extent of such impact, as reflected in the Corporation's financial statements, may be muted by these loan modifications, which would have the effect of delaying loan loss recognition until after any applicable deferral period.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused the Corporation to modify its business practices (including developing work from home and social distancing plans for our employees), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities. Furthermore, the Corporation\u2019s business operations have been, and may again in the future be, disrupted due to vendors and third-party service providers being unable to work or provide services effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic.\nCOVID-19 has not yet been contained and the extent to which it continues to impact the Corporation\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak, the potential for a seasonal or other resurgence, actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties to contain and treat the virus, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Moreover, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may heighten many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. While we do not yet know the full extent of the COVID-19 impact, the negative effects on the Corporation\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be material.\n\u2022As a participating lender in the Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cPPP\u201d or \u201cprogram\u201d), the Corporation and the Bank are subject to additional risks of litigation from the Bank\u2019s clients or other parties in connection with the Bank\u2019s processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted, which included a $349 billion loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. Under the PPP, small businesses, eligible nonprofits and certain others can apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. Under the terms of the program, loans are to be fully guaranteed by the SBA. Congress has approved additional funding for the program since it began, most recently on December 27, 2020 as part of the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act, whereby authority to make loans under the program was extended through March 31, 2021. The Bank is participating as a lender in the PPP. Because of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and the April 3, 2020 opening of the PPP, there was some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the program, which exposes the Corporation to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP.\nSince the opening of the PPP, several larger banks have been subject to litigation relating to the policies and procedures that they used in processing applications for the program. The Corporation and the Bank may be exposed to the risk of litigation: (1) from both customers and non-customers that have approached the Bank in connection with PPP loans and its policies and procedures used in processing applications for the program; and (2) from agents of the PPP borrowers claiming they are entitled to a portion of the Bank's loan processing fees as a result of their assisting borrowers with their PPP loan applications. If any such litigation is filed against the Corporation or the Bank and is not resolved in a manner favorable to the Corporation or the Bank, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP-related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPART I: ITEM 1A.
