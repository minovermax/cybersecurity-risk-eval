RISK FACTORS\nIn the course of conducting the Company\u2019s businesses, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to the Company\u2019s businesses. The Company\u2019s Enterprise Risk Management (\u201cERM\u201d) program incorporates risk management throughout the organization in identifying, managing, monitoring, and reporting risks. Our ERM program identifies EWBC\u2019s major risk categories as capital risk, strategic risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, operational risk, reputational risk, and legal and compliance risk. ERM, which is comprised of senior management of the Company, is headed by the Chief Risk Officer.\nDescribed below are the primary risks and uncertainties that, if realized, could have a material and adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. The risk factors below should not be considered a complete discussion of all of the risks and uncertainties the Company may face.\nMarket Risks\nUnfavorable general economic, political or industry conditions may adversely affect our operating results. Our businesses and results of operations are affected by the financial markets and general economic conditions in the U.S. and Greater China, including factors such as the level and volatility of short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, deflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, bankruptcies, household income, consumer spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies, liquidity of the global financial markets, availability and cost of capital and credit, investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets, and sustainability of economic growth in the U.S. and Greater China. The deterioration of any of these conditions could adversely affect our consumer and commercial businesses, our securities and derivatives portfolios, our level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, our capital levels and liquidity, and our results of operations. In addition, because the Company\u2019s operations and the collateral securing its real estate lending portfolio are concentrated in Northern and Southern California, the Company may be particularly susceptible to the adverse economic conditions in the state of California. Any unfavorable changes in the economic and market conditions could lead to the following risks:\n\u2022\nthe process the Company uses to estimate losses inherent in the Company\u2019s credit exposure requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including consideration of how these economic conditions might impair the ability of the borrowers to repay their loans. The level of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of the Company\u2019s estimates of losses inherent in the Company\u2019s credit exposure which may, in turn, adversely impact the Company\u2019s operating results and financial conditions;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s commercial and residential borrowers may not be able to make timely repayments of their loans, or a decrease in the value of real estate collateral securing the payment of such loans could result in credit losses, delinquencies, foreclosures and customer bankruptcies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results;\n\u2022\na decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services;\n\u2022\na decrease in deposit balances;\n\u2022\nfuture disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations, may result in an inability to borrow on favorable terms or at all from other financial institutions;\n\u2022\nthe value of the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio that the Company holds may be adversely affected by defaults by debtors; and\n\u2022\na loss of confidence in the financial services industry, our market sector and the equity markets by investors, placing pressure on the Company\u2019s stock price.\nFurther, the trade conflict between the U.S. and China could impose damage to the global economy, in terms of lower GDP growth, job displacements, diminishing investments to both the U.S. and China economies and long-term damage to the world trading system. In addition, U.S. banks exposed to the sectors most sensitive to the tariffs, and Chinese companies and borrowers may experience a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services and a deterioration in the credit quality of the loans to these borrowers.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real estate and thus the Company has a higher degree of risk from a downturn in real estate markets. As discussed in the risk factor above entitled \u201cUnfavorable general economic, political or industry conditions may adversely affect our operating results,\u201d a decline in real estate markets could impact the Company\u2019s business and financial condition because many of the Company\u2019s loans are secured by real estate. Real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by changes in general economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers, changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes, regulations and policies, and natural disasters, such as earthquakes and wildfires, which are particular to California. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s real estate collateral is located in California. If real estate values decline, the value of real estate collateral securing the Company\u2019s loans could be significantly reduced. The Company\u2019s ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and the Company would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. Furthermore, commercial real estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) and multifamily loans typically involve large balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Since payments on these loans are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, as well as the business and financial condition of the borrower, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market, adverse economic conditions, or changes in applicable government regulations. Borrowers\u2019 inability to repay such loans may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial performance. Our financial results depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on interest-earning assets and the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets primarily include loans extended, securities held in our investment portfolio and excess cash held to manage short-term liquidity. We fund our assets using deposits and borrowings. While we offer interest-bearing deposit products, a portion of our deposit balances are from noninterest-bearing products. Overall, the interest rates we receive on our interest-earning assets and pay on our interest-bearing liabilities could be affected by a variety of factors, including market interest rate changes, competition, regulatory requirements and a change in our product mix. Changes in key variable market interest rates such as the Federal Funds, National Prime, LIBOR or Treasury rates generally impact our interest rate spread. Because of the differences in maturities and repricing characteristics of the Company\u2019s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Increases in interest rates may result in a change in the mix of noninterest and interest-bearing deposit accounts. Rising interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase at a faster pace than the yield we earn on our assets, ultimately causing our net interest margin to decrease. Higher interest rates may also result in lower mortgage production income and increased charge-offs in certain segments of the loan portfolio, such as CRE and home equity. In contrast, declining interest rates would increase the Bank\u2019s lending capacity, decrease funding cost, increase prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs. Accordingly, changes in levels of interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest income, net interest margin, cost of deposits, loan origination volume, average loan portfolio balance, asset quality, liquidity and overall profitability.\nReforms to and uncertainty regarding LIBOR may adversely affect our business. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. While Intercontinental Exchange Inc., the company that administers LIBOR plans to continue publishing LIBOR, liquidity in the interbank markets that those LIBOR estimates are based upon has been declining. Accordingly, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the publication of such rates beyond 2021. In April 2018, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, announced the replacement of U.S. LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by U.S. Treasury securities called the SOFR. The first publication of SOFR was released in April 2018. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question and the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. The uncertainty as to the nature and effect of such reforms and actions and the political discontinuance of LIBOR may adversely affect the value of and return on our financial assets and liabilities that are based on or are linked to LIBOR, our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, these reforms may also require extensive changes to the contracts that govern these LIBOR based products, as well as our systems and processes.\nThe fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings. The Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. Its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. They can also materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold. Federal Reserve policies may also adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans, or could adversely create asset bubbles which result from prolonged periods of accommodative policy. This, in turn, may result in volatile markets and rapidly declining collateral values. Changes in Federal Reserve policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict. Consequently, the impact of these changes on our business and results of operations is difficult to predict.\nWe face risks associated with international operations. A substantial number of our customers have economic and cultural ties to Asia. The Bank\u2019s international presence includes five full-service branches in Greater China, located in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Shantou and Shenzhen. The Bank has two branches in Shanghai, including one in the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone. The Bank also has five representative offices in Greater China located in Beijing, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Taipei and Xiamen. Our efforts to expand our business in Greater China carries certain risks, including risks arising from the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate revenues from foreign operations, risks associated with leveraging and conducting business on an international basis, including among others, legal, regulatory and tax requirements and restrictions, cross-border trade restrictions or tariffs, uncertainties regarding liability, trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, political and economic risks, and financial risks including currency and payment risks. Further, volatility in the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges and/or a potential fall in real estate prices in China, among other things, may negatively impact asset values and the profitability and liquidity of the Company\u2019s customers operating in this region. These risks could adversely affect the success of our international operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we face risks that our employees and affiliates may fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing our international operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, anti-corruption laws, and other foreign laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could, among other things, result in enforcement actions and fines against us, as well as limitations on our conduct, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company\u2019s foreign currency translation exposure relates primarily to its China subsidiary that has its functional currency denominated in Chinese Renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d). In addition, as the Company continues to expand its businesses in China and Hong Kong, certain transactions are conducted in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d). Although the Company has entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of the foreign exchange fluctuations, given the volatility of exchange rates, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to effectively manage foreign currency translation risk. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material unfavorable impact on the Company\u2019s net income, therefore adversely affecting the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCapital and Liquidity Risks\nAs a regulated entity, we are subject to capital requirements, and a failure to meet these standards could adversely affect our financial condition. The Company and the Bank are subject to certain capital and liquidity rules, including the Basel III Capital Rules, which establish the minimum capital adequacy requirements and may require us to increase our regulatory capital or liquidity targets, increase regulatory capital ratios, or change how we calculate regulatory capital. As such, we are required to adopt more stringent capital adequacy standards than we have in the past. In addition, we may be required to increase our capital levels, even in the absence of actual adverse economic conditions or forecasts, and capital planning based on the hypothetical future adverse economic scenarios. As of January 1, 2019, we met the requirements of the Basel III Capital Rules, including the capital conservation buffer fully phased-in. Compliance with these capital requirements may limit capital-intensive operations and increase operational costs, and we may be limited or prohibited from distributing dividends or repurchasing stocks. This could adversely affect our ability to expand or maintain present business levels, which may adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Additional information on the regulatory capital requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank is set forth in Item 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation - Capital Requirements.\nThe Company\u2019s dependence on dividends from the Bank could affect the Company\u2019s liquidity and ability to pay dividends. East West is dependent on the Bank for dividends, distributions and other payments. Our principal source of cash flows, including cash flows to pay dividends to our stockholders and principal and interest on our outstanding debt, is dividend income from the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends to East West is limited by federal and California law. Subject to the Bank meeting or exceeding regulatory capital requirements, regulatory approval is required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year would exceed the sum of the Bank\u2019s net income for that year and its retained earnings for the preceding two years. Federal law also prohibits the Bank from paying dividends that would be greater than its undivided profits. In addition, Federal Reserve guidance sets forth the supervisory expectation that bank holding companies will inform and consult with the Federal Reserve in advance of issuing a dividend that exceeds earnings for the quarter and should not pay dividends in a rolling four quarter period in an amount that exceeds net income for the period.\nThe Company is subject to liquidity risk, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s funding levels. Market conditions or other events could negatively affect the level of or cost of funding, which in turn could affect the Company\u2019s ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, or fund asset growth and new business initiatives at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Although the Company has implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated changes in assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet commitments under various economic conditions, a substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations and financial condition. If the cost effectiveness or the availability of supply in the credit markets is reduced for a prolonged period of time, the Company\u2019s funding needs may require the Company to access funding and manage liquidity by other means. These alternatives may include generating client deposits, securitizing or selling loans, and further managing loan growth and investment opportunities. These alternative means of funding may not be available under stressed market conditions or realized timely.\nAny downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cost of funding, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. Credit rating agencies regularly evaluate us, and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength, capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality and ability to generate earnings. Some of these factors are not entirely within our control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry. Severe downgrades in credit ratings could impact our business and reduce the Company\u2019s profitability in different ways, including a reduction in the Company\u2019s access to capital markets, triggering additional collateral or funding obligations which could negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, our counterparties, as well as our clients, rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us. If we experience a decline in our credit rating, this could result in a decrease in the number of counterparties and clients who may be willing to transact with us. Our borrowing costs may also be affected by various external factors, including market volatility and concerns or perceptions about the financial services industry. There can be no assurance that we can maintain our credit ratings nor will this be lowered in the future.\nCredit Risks\nThe Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses level may not be adequate to cover actual losses. In accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and non-performance, and an allowance for unfunded credit reserves which, when combined, are referred to as the allowance for credit losses. Our allowance for loan losses is based on our evaluation of risks associated with our loans held-for-investment portfolio, including historical loss experience, expected loss calculations, delinquencies, performing status, the size and composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, and concentrations within the portfolio. The allowance estimation process requires subjective and complex judgments, including analysis of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. Current economic conditions in the U.S. and in the international markets could deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, greater than expected deterioration in credit quality of our loan portfolio or in the value of collateral securing these loans. Our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to absorb actual credit losses, and future provisions for credit losses could materially and adversely affect our operating results. The amount of future losses is influenced by changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates that may be beyond our control, and these losses may exceed current estimates.\nAdditionally, in order to maximize the collection of loan balances, we sometimes modify loan terms when there is a reasonable chance that an appropriate modification would allow the borrower to continue servicing the debt. If such modifications ultimately are less effective at mitigating loan losses than we expect, we may incur losses in excess of the specific amount of allowance for loan losses associated with a modified loan, and this would result in additional provision for loan losses. In addition, we establish a reserve for losses associated with our unfunded credit reserves. The level of the allowance for unfunded credit reserves is determined by following a methodology similar to that used to establish our allowance for loan losses in our loans held-for-investment portfolio. There can be no assurance that our allowance for unfunded credit reserves will be adequate to provide for the actual losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments. An increase in the allowance for unfunded credit reserves in any period may result in a charge to earnings.\nWe may be subject to increased credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent that our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral. Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans are concentrated in borrowers affected by the same or similar economic conditions in the markets in which we operate or elsewhere, which could result in materially higher credit losses. For example, the Bank has a concentration of real estate loans in California. Potential deterioration in the California real estate market could result in additional loan charge-offs and provision for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. If any particular industry or market sector were to experience economic difficulties, loan collectability from customers operating in those industries or sectors may differ from what we expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOperational Risks\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could disrupt our businesses, and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and liquidity, as well as cause reputational harm. The potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization and from our interactions with third parties. Our operational and security systems, infrastructure, including our computer systems, network infrastructure, data management and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance. In addition, we rely on our employees and third parties in our ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error or malfeasance or failure or breach of third-party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk. We have taken measures to implement backup systems and safeguards to support our operations, but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to the third parties with whom we interact. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or may become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could adversely affect our ability to process these transactions or provide certain services. There could be electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages, natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods, wildfires, disease pandemics, and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts. We continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth, and this entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Operational risk exposures could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and liquidity, and may result in loss of confidence, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation.\nA cyber-attack, information or security breach, or a technology failure of ours or of a third party could adversely affect our ability to conduct businesses, manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, increase our costs to maintain and update our operational and security systems and infrastructure, and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, as well as cause reputational harm. The Company offers various internet-based services to its clients, including online banking services. The secure transmission of confidential information over the internet is essential in maintaining our clients\u2019 confidence in the Company\u2019s online services. In addition, our business is highly dependent on the security and efficacy of our infrastructure, computer and data management systems, as well as those of third parties with whom we interact. Cyber security risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunication technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states and other external parties. Our businesses rely on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. We rely on digital technologies, computer, database and email systems, software and networks. Notwithstanding our defensive systems and processes that are designed to prevent security breaches and periodically test the Company\u2019s security, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will be effective, especially as the threat from cyber-attacks is continuous and severe, attacks are becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. Failure to mitigate breaches of security could result in violation of applicable privacy laws, reputational damage, regulatory fines, litigation exposure, increase security compliance costs, affect the Company\u2019s ability to offer and grow the online services, and could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations and financial condition. We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that have resulted in any material system failure, incident or security breach to date.\nFailure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses. The Company may face risks associated with the ability to utilize information technology systems to support our operations effectively. The financial services industry is continuously undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Company\u2019s operations. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s businesses and, in turn, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we do not implement systems effectively or if our outsourcing business partners do not perform their functions properly, there could be an adverse effect on us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively maintain or improve our systems and processes, or utilize outsourced talent, to meet our business needs efficiently. Any such failure could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition, and reputation.\nNatural disasters and geopolitical events beyond the Company\u2019s control could adversely affect the Company. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, extreme weather conditions, hurricanes, floods, and other acts of nature and geopolitical events involving terrorism or military conflict could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business operations and those of the Company\u2019s customers and cause substantial damage and loss to real and personal property. These natural disasters and geopolitical events could impair the borrowers\u2019 ability to service their loans, decrease the level and duration of deposits by customers, erode the value of loan collateral, and result in an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, and provision for loan losses, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe actions and soundness of other financial institutions could affect the Company. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Company executes transactions with various counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks and investment banks. Defaults by financial services institutions and uncertainty in the financial services industry in general could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and may expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparties or clients. Further, the Company\u2019s credit risk may increase when the underlying collateral held cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to the Company. Any such losses could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s controls and procedures could fail or be circumvented. Management regularly reviews and updates the Company\u2019s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurances of the effectiveness of these systems and controls, and that the objectives of these controls have been met. Any failure or circumvention of the Company\u2019s controls and procedures, and any failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s prospects. Competition for qualified personnel in the banking industry is intense and there is a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of, and experience in, the regional banking industry, especially in the West Coast market. The process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out the Company\u2019s strategies is often lengthy. The Company\u2019s success depends, to a significant degree, upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management, loan origination, finance, administrative, marketing and technical personnel, as well as upon the continued contributions of its management and personnel. In particular, the Company\u2019s success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the abilities of certain key executives.\nWe face strong competition in the financial services industry and we could lose business or suffer margin declines as a result. The Company operates in a highly competitive environment. The Company conducts the majority of its operations in California. Our competitors include commercial banks, savings and loan associations, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and other regional, national, and global financial institutions. Some of the major competitors include multinational financial service companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Areas of competition include interest rates on loans and deposits, customer services, and a range of price and quality of products and services, including new technology-driven products and services. Failure to attract and retain banking customers may adversely impact the Company\u2019s loan and deposit growth.\nThe Company has engaged in and may continue to engage in further expansion through acquisitions, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s businesses and earnings. There are risks associated with expanding through acquisitions. These risks include, among others, incorrectly assessing the asset quality of a bank acquired in a particular transaction, encountering greater than anticipated costs in integrating acquired businesses, facing resistance from customers or employees, and being unable to profitably deploy assets acquired in the transaction. Additional country or region-specific risks are associated with transactions outside the U.S., including in Greater China. To the extent the Company issues capital stock in connection with additional transactions, these transactions and related stock issuances may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) and share ownership.\nRegulatory, Compliance and Legal Risks\nChanges in current and future legislation and regulation may require the Company to change its business practices, increase costs, limit the Company\u2019s ability to make investments and generate revenue, or otherwise adversely affect business operations and/or competitiveness. EWBC is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws, as well as supervisions and examinations by the DBO, FDIC, Federal Reserve, FHLB, SEC, CFPB, U.S. and State Attorneys General, and other government bodies. Our overseas operations in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of those jurisdictions as well as supervisions and examinations by financial regulators for those jurisdictions, which have also increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. Moreover, regulation of the financial services industry continues to undergo major changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies could affect the manner in which EWBC conducts business. In addition, such changes could also subject us to additional costs and may limit the types of financial services and products we offer, and the investments we make.\nGood standing with our regulators is of fundamental importance to the continuation and growth of our businesses given that banks operate in an extensively regulated environment under state and federal law. In the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties, federal, state and non-U.S. regulators have significant discretion and power to initiate enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations, and unsafe and unsound practices. Further, regulators and bank supervisors continue to exercise qualitative supervision and regulation of our industry and specific business operations and related matters. Violations of laws and regulations or deemed deficiencies in risk management or other qualitative practices also may be incorporated into the Company\u2019s bank supervisory ratings. A downgrade in these ratings, or other regulatory actions and settlements could limit the Company\u2019s ability to pursue acquisitions or conduct other expansionary activities and require new or additional regulatory approvals before engaging in certain other business activities.\nFailure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in civil or criminal sanctions by state, federal and non-U.S. agencies, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of our banking charter, civil or criminal monetary penalties and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations and financial condition. We continue to make adjustments to our business and operations, capital, policies, procedures and controls to comply with these laws and regulations, final rulemaking, and interpretations from the regulatory authorities. See Item 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation for more information about the regulations to which we are subject.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations. The BSA, the U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective AML program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports when appropriate. They also mandate that we are ultimately responsible to ensure our third party vendors adhere to the same laws and regulations. In addition to other bank regulatory agencies, FinCEN is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has been engaging in coordinated enforcement efforts with the state and federal banking regulators, as well as the Department of Justice, CFPB, Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d).\nWe are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by OFAC regarding, among other things, the prohibition of transacting business with, and the need to freeze assets of, certain persons and organizations identified as a threat to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the U.S. If our policies, procedures and systems or those of our third party vendors are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including any acquisition plans. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.\nWe are subject to significant financial and reputational risk arising from lawsuits and other legal proceedings. We face significant risk from lawsuits and claims brought by consumers, borrowers and counterparties. This includes claims for monetary damages, penalties and fines, as well as demands for injunctive relief. If these lawsuits or claims, whether founded or unfounded, are not resolved in a favorable manner to us, they could lead to significant financial obligations for the Company, as well as restrictions or changes to how we conduct our businesses. Although we establish accruals for legal matters when and as required by U.S. GAAP and certain expenses and liabilities in connection with such matters may be covered by insurance, the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher than the amounts accrued and/or insured. Substantial legal liability could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation. In addition, we may suffer significant reputational harm as a result of lawsuits and claims, adversely impacting our ability to attract and retain customers and investors. Moreover, it may be difficult to predict the outcome of certain legal proceedings, which may present additional uncertainty to our business prospects.\nAccounting and Tax Risks\nChanges in accounting standards or changes in how the accounting standards are interpreted or applied could materially impact the Company\u2019s financial statements. From time to time, the FASB or the SEC may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. In addition, the FASB, SEC, banking regulators and the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm may also amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards should be applied. These changes may be difficult to predict and could impact how we prepare and report the Company\u2019s financial statements. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, potentially resulting in restatements to the prior period\u2019s financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) that will require the earlier recognition of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments based on an expected loss model, replacing the incurred loss model that is currently in use. The new guidance is effective on January 1, 2020. This new accounting standard is expected to result in an increase in the allowance for credit losses. For more information related to the impacts of ASU 2016-13, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles - Recent Accounting Pronouncements - Standards not yet Adopted to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves, reserves related to litigation and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. Accounting policies related to these estimates and assumptions are critical because they require management to make subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, we may be required to restate prior-period financial statements. For a description of these policies, refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThere may be substantial changes to fiscal and tax policies that may adversely affect our business. From time to time, the U.S. government may make substantial changes to a variety of federal policies and regulations, including fiscal and tax policies that may affect our business. In addition, new tax laws, the expiration of or changes in the existing tax laws, or the interpretation of those laws, could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s positions or its actions taken prior to such changes, may be compromised by such changes. In addition, the Company\u2019s actions taken in response to, or reliance upon, such changes in the tax laws may impact our tax position in a manner that may result in adverse financial conditions. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted and made significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The changes enacted by the Tax Act were partially effective in the 2017 tax year and were fully effective in the 2018 tax year. It is possible that the IRS could issue subsequent guidance or take positions upon audit that differ from our prior interpretations and assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our income tax liabilities, results of operations and financial condition. For information on the impact of the Tax Act on our 2018 financial results, refer to Note 13 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company\u2019s investments in certain tax-advantaged projects may not generate returns as anticipated and may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations. The Company invests in certain tax-advantaged projects that support affordable housing, community development and renewable energy resources. The Company\u2019s investments in these projects are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits, and other tax benefits, over specified time periods. Due diligence review is performed both prior to the initial investment and on an ongoing basis. The Company is subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits, which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level, may fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and may not be able to be realized. The possible inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial results. The risk of not being able to realize the tax credits and other tax benefits depends on many factors outside the Company\u2019s control, including changes in the applicable tax code and the ability of the projects to be completed. The Company has previously invested in mobile solar generators sold and managed by DC Solar and its affiliates (\"DC Solar\"). For reasons that were not known or knowable to the Company, DC Solar had its assets frozen in December 2018. DC Solar filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 2019. In February 2019, an affidavit from a Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) special agent stated that DC Solar was operating a fraudulent \"Ponzi-like scheme\" and that the majority of mobile solar generators sold to investors and managed by DC Solar and the majority of the related lease revenues claimed to have been received by DC Solar may not have existed. Certain investors in DC Solar, including the Company, received tax credits for making these renewable resource investments. As a result of the information provided in the FBI special agent's affidavit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, the Company believes that, in 2019, it may be required to record an uncertain tax position liability under Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 740, Income Taxes for a significant portion of the tax credit benefits the Company had received in the past. The Company will continue to evaluate its existing tax positions, as well as new positions as they arise. However, if the Company is required to recognize an uncertain tax position liability in its 2019 consolidated financial statements, the uncertain tax position liability and charge-offs may have an adverse impact on our income tax liabilities, results of operations and financial condition.\nOther Risks\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact the Company\u2019s stockholders. Provisions of Delaware law and of the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation, as amended, and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Company or could have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of the Company. For example, the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation requires the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of voting stock to approve certain business combinations. The Company is also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which would make it more difficult for another party to acquire the Company without the approval of the Board of Directors. Additionally, the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation, as amended, authorizes the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock which could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal. These and other provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company, even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of the stockholders.\nManaging reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees. Threats to the Company\u2019s reputation can come from many sources, including unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies, and questionable or fraudulent activities of the Company\u2019s customers. The Company has policies and procedures in place to protect its reputation and promote ethical conduct, but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Negative publicity regarding the Company\u2019s businesses, employees or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock may be volatile or may decline. The trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside the Company\u2019s control. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. Among the factors that could affect the Company\u2019s stock price are:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by the Company or its competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nactions by institutional stockholders;\n\u2022\naddition or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the stock price and operating results of the Company\u2019s competitors;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry;\n\u2022\nproposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u2022\ncyclical fluctuations;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock; and\n\u2022\nanticipated or pending investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve or affect the Company.\nIndustry factors, general economic and political conditions and events, such as cyber or terrorist attacks, economic downturn or recessions, interest rate changes, credit loss trends or currency fluctuations, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of our operating results. A significant decline in the Company\u2019s stock price could result in substantial losses for stockholders.\nIf the Company\u2019s goodwill was determined to be impaired, it would result in a charge against earnings and thus a reduction in stockholders\u2019 equity. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently, if necessary. Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are to be used as the basis for measuring impairment, when available. Other acceptable valuation methods include present value measurements based on multiples of earnings or revenues, or similar performance measures. If the Company were to determine that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded its implied fair value, the Company would be required to write down the value of the goodwill on the balance sheet, adversely affecting earnings as well as capital.", "PERMNO": 86719, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "EWBC"}
