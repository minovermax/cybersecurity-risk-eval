RISK FACTORS\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results can be affected by many factors, including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accounting policies described in MD&A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial results. The following discussion of key risk factors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunction with MD&A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Chapter 11 Proceedings and Liquidity\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 and are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with their bankruptcy cases.\nOn the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows of PG&E Corporation and the Utility will be subject to various risks, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability to develop, consummate, and implement a plan of reorganization with respect to PG&E Corporation and the Utility during the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nthe ability to develop and obtain applicable Bankruptcy Court, creditor, and regulatory approval of a successful plan of reorganization and the effect of any alternative proposals, views, and objections of official committees, creditors, state and federal regulators, and other stakeholders, which may make it difficult to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions in the Chapter 11 Cases and the outcomes of Bankruptcy Court rulings and of the Chapter 11 Cases in general;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with third-party motions or adversary proceedings in the Chapter 11 Cases, which may interfere with business operations, including additional collateral requirements, or the ability to formulate and implement a plan of reorganization;\n\u2022\nincreased costs related to the Chapter 11 Cases and related litigation;\n\u2022\npotential for an increase in general unsecured claims as a result of the rejection of any executory contracts or unexpired leases as permitted under the Bankruptcy Code;\n\u2022\nthe ability to maintain or obtain sufficient financing sources for ongoing operations during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases or thereafter or to fund a plan of reorganization and meet future obligations, including commitments outlined in the Utility's 2020 GRC and other regulatory proceedings;\n\u2022\nthe potential for a material decrease in the number of counterparties that are willing to engage in transactions, including commodity-related transactions, with PG&E Corporation or the Utility and a significant increase in the amount of collateral required to engage in any such transactions;\n\u2022\nthe potential for a loss of, or a disruption in the materials or services received from, suppliers, contractors or service providers with whom the Utility has commercial relationships or adverse developments in the commercial and financial terms on which such providers engage in such relationships with PG&E Corporation and the Utility;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with the potential that the Utility will not be able to comply with the capital structure requirements authorized by the CPUC, to the extent applicable, during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases or thereafter;\n\u2022\npotential increased difficulty in retaining and motivating key employees and potential increased difficulty in attracting new employees during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases and thereafter;\n\u2022\nthe significant time and effort required to be spent by senior management in dealing with the Chapter 11 Cases and restructuring activities rather than focusing exclusively on business operations; and\n\u2022\nthe ability to continue as a going concern.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility will also be subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions and decisions of creditors and other third parties who have claims or interests in the Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s plans. These risks and uncertainties could materially affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows in various ways that cannot be predicted and may significantly increase the time PG&E Corporation and the Utility have to operate in Chapter 11. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, it is not possible to predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, nor is it possible to predict the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s corporate and capital structure.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility will be required to seek approvals of the Bankruptcy Court and certain regulators in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, and certain parties may object, intervene and protest approval, absent the imposition of terms or conditions to resolve their concerns. Such approvals may be denied, conditioned or delayed.\nOperating under Chapter 11 may restrict the ability of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to pursue strategic and operational initiatives.\nUnder Chapter 11, transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities or to adapt to changing market or industry conditions. These limitations include, among other things, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\nsell assets outside the normal course of business;\n\u2022\nmake capital investments outside the normal course of business;\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge or sell or otherwise dispose of assets outside the normal course of business;\n\u2022\ngrant liens; and\n\u2022\nfinance operations, investments or other capital needs or engage in other business activities, including the ability to achieve California\u2019s renewable energy goals.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility may experience increased levels of employee attrition as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nAs a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may experience increased levels of employee attrition, and their employees will likely face considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could materially affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incentivize key employees to remain with PG&E Corporation or the Utility, as applicable, through the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is limited by restrictions on implementation of retention and incentive programs under the Bankruptcy Code. The loss of services of members of senior management could impair PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to execute their strategies and implement operational initiatives, which would likely have a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s historical financial information may not be indicative of future financial performance.\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s capital structure will likely be significantly altered under any plan of reorganization confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. Under fresh-start accounting rules that may apply to PG&E Corporation and the Utility upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization, their assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair value. Accordingly, if fresh-start accounting rules apply, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition and results of operations following emergence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in their historical financial statements. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and the development of a plan of reorganization, it is also possible that additional restructuring and related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such charges could be material to PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nIf PG&E Corporation and the Utility are not able to develop and consummate a consensual plan of reorganization, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by a protracted restructuring.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility have commenced the Chapter 11 Cases without the benefit of a restructuring support agreement or agreed consensual plan of reorganization with any of its creditors or other key constituents. The Bankruptcy Code gives PG&E Corporation and the Utility the exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization for 120 days after the filing and, subject to extension for cause, up to a maximum of 18 months from the Petition Date, and prohibits creditors, equity security holders and others from proposing a plan of reorganization during this period. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have currently retained the exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization until at least May 29, 2019. If that right is terminated, however, or the exclusivity period is not extended or expires, there could be a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to achieve confirmation of a plan of reorganization that would enable PG&E Corporation and the Utility to reach their stated goals.\nAccordingly, no assurance can be provided as to the length of time during which the Chapter 11 Cases will be pending, whether a consensual or other plan of reorganization can be successfully developed and consummated, what the terms of any reorganization of PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be, and what effect any such plan or reorganization would have on the capital structure (or any part thereof) of PG&E Corporation and the Utility or on any of their respective equity, debt and other stakeholders, including as to matters of taxation and recovery or distributions upon consummation of any plan of reorganization.\nIf PG&E Corporation and the Utility are not able to develop and consummate a consensual plan of reorganization within the exclusivity period, one or more third parties may propose a competing plan of reorganization. PG&E Corporation and the Utility may have limited ability to prevent an alternative plan of reorganization from being approved by the Bankruptcy Court, even if PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not believe such plan is in their best interest and the best interests of their stakeholders. Even if PG&E Corporation and the Utility are successful in obtaining confirmation of a plan of reorganization following the expiration of their exclusivity period, the process may be lengthy, costly and disruptive. A contested plan of reorganization proceeding would likely have a more pronounced material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows than a consensual plan of reorganization. Even if PG&E Corporation and the Utility are able to obtain requisite stakeholder approval, the Bankruptcy Court may not confirm a plan of reorganization.\nThe uncertainty surrounding a prolonged restructuring would also have other material effects on PG&E Corporation and the Utility including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe ability of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to raise additional capital;\n\u2022\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s liquidity;\n\u2022\nhow PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s business is viewed by regulators, investors, lenders and credit ratings agencies;\n\u2022\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s enterprise value; and\n\u2022\nPG&E Corporation's and the Utility's ability to continue as a going concern.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in their Chapter 11 Cases, which could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all claims arising prior to its filing under Chapter 11. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s Chapter 11 Cases: (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization and (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. Any claims not ultimately discharged through a plan of reorganization could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may have a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows on a post-reorganization basis and may cast substantial doubt on PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe DIP Facilities may be insufficient to fund PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s cash requirements through their emergence from bankruptcy.\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s liquidity, including PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to meet their ongoing operational obligations, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to comply with the terms and conditions of any post-petition financing and cash collateral order entered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, including the financing orders entered with respect to the DIP Credit Agreement, (ii) PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to maintain adequate cash on hand, (iii) PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to generate cash flow from operations, (iv) PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to develop, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization or other alternative restructuring transaction and (v) the cost, duration and outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility will be subject to various risks, including but not limited to (i) the inability to maintain or obtain sufficient financing sources for operations or to fund any plan of reorganization and meet future obligations, and (ii) increased legal and other professional costs associated with the Chapter 11 Cases and the reorganization.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility have entered into the DIP Credit Agreement. As a result of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s interim approval of the DIP Credit Agreement on January 31, 2019 and the satisfaction of the other conditions thereof, the DIP Credit Agreement became effective on February 1, 2019, and a portion of the DIP Revolving Facility in the amount of $1.5 billion (including $750 million of the letter of credit subfacility) was made available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility. As of February 28, 2019, the remainder of the DIP Revolving Facility (including the remainder of the $1.5 billion letter of credit subfacility), the DIP Initial Term Loan Facility and the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility are unavailable for borrowing and will remain unavailable until and unless the Bankruptcy Court approves the availability thereof following a final hearing. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the date of the final hearing, but it is currently scheduled for March 13, 2019. There can be no assurances that the Bankruptcy Court will grant final approval of the DIP Facilities at the final hearing, or at all. For more information on the DIP Credit Agreement, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nThe DIP Credit Agreement will mature on December 31, 2020, subject to the Utility\u2019s option to extend the maturity to December 31, 2021 if certain terms and conditions are satisfied, including the payment of an extension fee.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility will face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of their liquidity and capital resources during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, and will have limited, if any, access to additional financing. PG&E Corporation and the Utility cannot provide assurance that cash on hand, cash flow from operations, distributions received from their subsidiaries and borrowings available under the DIP Credit Agreement will be sufficient to continue to fund operations during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. The ability of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to maintain adequate liquidity depends in part upon industry conditions and general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond their control. In the event that cash on hand, cash flow from operations, distributions received from subsidiaries and availability under the DIP Credit Agreement are not sufficient to meet these liquidity needs, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be required to seek additional financing, and can provide no assurance that additional financing would be available or, if available, offered on acceptable terms.\nThe DIP Credit Agreement imposes a number of restrictions on PG&E Corporation and the Utility that may, among other things, limit their ability to conduct their business, or pursue new business opportunities and strategies. Additionally, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be unable to comply with the covenants imposed by the DIP Credit Agreement. Such non-compliance could result in an event of default under the DIP Credit Agreement that, if not cured or waived, could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nThe DIP Credit Agreement imposes a number of restrictions on PG&E Corporation and the Utility, including, among other things, affirmative covenants requiring PG&E Corporation and the Utility to provide financial information, cash flow forecasts, variance reports and other information to the administrative agent. The DIP Credit Agreement also contains general affirmative covenants such as compliance with all applicable laws, maintenance of licenses from necessary governmental authorities, maintenance of property and preservation of corporate existence. Negative covenants contained in the DIP Credit Agreement include restrictions on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage in mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions, pay dividends and distributions, and make payments in respect of junior or pre-petition indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions. The Utility\u2019s ability to borrow under the DIP Credit Agreement is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions precedent set forth therein. For more information on the DIP Credit Agreement, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nAs a result of these covenants and restrictions, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be limited in their ability to conduct their business, and respond to changing business, market, and economic conditions. These provisions may also limit PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to pursue new business opportunities and strategies.\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond their control and their failure to comply, or obtain a waiver in the event PG&E Corporation or the Utility cannot comply with a covenant, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing the DIP Credit Agreement that, if not cured or waived, could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility may not be able to obtain exit financing to, among other things, repay borrowings under the DIP Credit Agreement, and even if they are able to obtain such exit financing, the agreement governing such exit financing may significantly restrict PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financing and operational flexibility. The ability of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to emerge from bankruptcy will likely depend on obtaining financings from a number of potential sources, and there can be no assurance that any such financings or other potential sources can be obtained expeditiously or on favorable terms, if at all.\nIt is expected that the DIP Credit Agreement will be repaid using, in whole or in part, the proceeds from borrowings under exit financings. PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to obtain such exit financing will depend on, among other things, the timing and outcome of various ongoing matters in the Chapter 11 Cases, their business, operations and financial condition, and market conditions. There can be no assurance that PG&E Corporation and the Utility will be able to obtain such exit financings on reasonable economic terms, or at all. If exit financing cannot be obtained, they may not be able to repay the DIP Credit Agreement at maturity or emerge from bankruptcy. Any exit financing that PG&E Corporation and the Utility are able to obtain may include a number of significant restrictive or financial covenants which could impair their financial and operational flexibility and make it difficult to react to market conditions and satisfy their ongoing capital needs and unanticipated cash requirements.\nThe ability of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to emerge from bankruptcy will likely depend on proceeds received from a number of potential sources. These potential sources may include financings in the capital and credit markets, securitization, proceeds of asset sales or other dispositions, and other potential sources. The ability to execute on any such financings or other potential sources will be subject to a variety of factors, many of which will be beyond the control of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and may require consent or other action of federal and state regulators (including the FERC and the CPUC), the state legislature and executive branch, the Bankruptcy Court, other governmental entities, and other potential sources of third-party financing. There can be no assurance that any such financings or other potential sources can be obtained expeditiously or on favorable terms, if at all.\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared assuming that PG&E Corporation and the Utility will continue as a going concern. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are facing extraordinary challenges relating to a series of catastrophic wildfires that occurred in 2018 and 2017. Uncertainty regarding these matters raises substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's abilities to continue as going concerns. In addition, there is inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have not included any financial statement adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements to this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared assuming that PG&E Corporation and the Utility will continue as a going concern. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are facing extraordinary challenges relating to a series of catastrophic wildfires that occurred in 2018 and 2017. Management has concluded that these circumstances raise substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to continue as going concerns, and their independent registered public accountants have included an explanatory paragraph in their auditors\u2019 report which states certain conditions exist which raise substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to continue as going concerns in relation to the foregoing. In addition, there is inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. For further discussion of such uncertainty, see the risk factors above in \u201cRisks Related to Chapter 11 Proceedings and Liquidity\u201d in this Item 1A. PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. See \u201cReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\u201d in Item 8.\nTrading in PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks.\nTrading in PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. The ultimate recovery, if any, by holders of PG&E Corporation\u2019s or the Utility\u2019s securities in the Chapter 11 Cases could differ substantially from any value that may be implied by the trading prices of such securities at any particular time during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nRisks Related to Wildfires\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, notwithstanding the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, notwithstanding the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases. As detailed below in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to numerous lawsuits in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires by various plaintiffs, including wildfire victims, insurance carriers, and various government entities, under multiple theories of liability. These lawsuits generally assert that the Utility\u2019s alleged failure to maintain and repair its distribution and transmission lines and failure to properly maintain the vegetation surrounding such lines were the causes of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires.\nDue to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, these plaintiffs have been stayed from continuing to prosecute pending litigation and from commencing new lawsuits against PG&E Corporation or the Utility on account of pre-petition obligations. PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process. If the Utility\u2019s facilities, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are determined to be the substantial cause of one or more fires, and the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies, the Utility could be liable for property damage, business interruption, interest, and attorneys\u2019 fees without having been found negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, could be substantial and have a material adverse effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility, including on PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's ability to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization. (See \u201cThe doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&E Corporation or the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows\u201d below.) In addition to such claims for property damage, business interruption, interest, and attorneys\u2019 fees, the Utility could be liable for fire suppression costs, evacuation costs, medical expenses, personal injury damages, punitive damages, and other damages under other theories of liability, including if the Utility were found to have been negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, could be substantial and have a material adverse effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility, including on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization. Among other things, it is uncertain at this time as to the number of wildfire-related claims that will be filed in the Chapter 11 Cases, the number of current and future claims that will be settled in a plan of reorganization, how claims for punitive damages and claims by variously situated persons will be treated and whether such claims will be allowed, and the impact that historical settlement values for wildfire claims may have on the estimation of wildfire liability in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nFurther, the Utility could be subject to material fines or penalties if the CPUC or any law enforcement agency brought an enforcement action, including a criminal proceeding, and determined that the Utility failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Such actions would not be subject to the automatic stay.\nAs described below in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, based on information made available by the California Department of Insurance, insurers have received an aggregate amount of approximately $18.4 billion of insurance claims made as of the dates noted below related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect that additional claims have been submitted and will continue to be submitted to insurers, particularly with respect to the 2018 Camp fire. These claims reflect insured property losses only. The $18.4 billion of insurance claims described below does not account for uninsured or underinsured property losses, interest, attorneys\u2019 fees, fire suppression and clean-up costs, evacuation costs, personal injury or wrongful death damages, medical expenses or other costs, such as potential punitive damages, fines or penalties, or damages for claims related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires that have not manifested yet (\"future claims\"), each of which could be significant and could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. The scope of all claims related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires is not known at this time because of the applicable statutes of limitations under California law. PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process.\nIf PG&E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for certain or all of the costs, expenses and other losses described above with respect to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, the amount of such liability could exceed $30 billion, which amount does not include potential punitive damages, fines and penalties or damages related to future claims. In certain circumstances, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s liability could be substantially greater than such amount. As a result, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.\nPotential liabilities related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires depend on various factors, including but not limited to the cause of each fire, contributing causes of the fires (including alternative potential origins, weather and climate related issues), the number, size and type of structures damaged or destroyed, the contents of such structures and other personal property damage, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys\u2019 fees for claimants, the nature and extent of any personal injuries, including the loss of lives, the extent to which future claims arise, the amount of fire suppression and clean-up costs, other damages the Utility may be responsible for if found negligent, and the amount of any penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities. There are a number of unknown facts and legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims that may be asserted against PG&E Corporation and the Utility and the treatment of such claims in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nFor more information about the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, see \u201c2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires\u201d in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility are the subject of lawsuits and could be the subject of additional investigations, citations, fines or enforcement actions in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility are the subject of a number of lawsuits that have been filed against PG&E Corporation and the Utility in Sonoma, Napa and San Francisco Counties\u2019 Superior Courts in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, several of which seek to be certified as class actions, asserting damages that include wrongful death, personal injury, property damage, evacuation costs, medical expenses, punitive damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, and other damages. Insurance carriers who have made payments to their insureds for property damage arising out of the 2017 Northern California wildfires have filed 48 subrogation complaints in the San Francisco County Superior Court as of January 28, 2019. These complaints allege, among other things, negligence, inverse condemnation, trespass and nuisance. The allegations are similar to the ones made by individual plaintiffs. Insurance carriers have filed 37 similar subrogation complaints with respect to the 2018 Camp fire in the Sacramento County Superior Court. Further, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have been named as defendants in securities class action litigation related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and 2018 Camp fire.\nDue to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, these plaintiffs have been stayed from continuing to prosecute pending litigation and from commencing new lawsuits against PG&E Corporation or the Utility on account of pre-petition obligations. However, PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be the subject of additional lawsuits on account of obligations arising after the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases or the Bankruptcy Court could lift the automatic stay with respect to such pre-petition obligations. Further, PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be the subject of additional investigations, citations, fines or enforcement actions in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. The wildfire litigation could take a number of years to be resolved through the Chapter 11 process because of the complexity of the matters, including the ongoing investigation into the causes of the fires and the growing number of parties and claims involved. The ultimate number and allowed amount of such claims are not presently known and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nIf PG&E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for any punitive damages or subject to fines or penalties in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, their financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.\nIf PG&E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for any punitive damages or subject to fines or penalties, the amount of such punitive damages, fines and penalties could be significant and could materially affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, as well as PG&E Corporation's and the Utility\u2019s ability to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization. The Utility has received significant fines and penalties in connection with past incidents. For example, in 2015, the CPUC approved a decision that imposed penalties on the Utility totaling $1.6 billion in connection with natural gas explosion that occurred in the City of San Bruno on September 9, 2010 (the \u201cSan Bruno explosion\u201d). These penalties represented nearly three times the underlying liability for the San Bruno explosion of approximately $558 million incurred for third-party claims, exclusive of shareholder derivative lawsuits and legal costs incurred. The amount of punitive damages, fines and penalties imposed on PG&E Corporation or the Utility could likewise be a significant amount in relation to the underlying liabilities with respect to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires.\nThe amount of potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires is expected to greatly exceed the amount of PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s insurance coverage for wildfire events and securing liability insurance in future years is expected to be increasingly difficult and expensive, if available at all.\nThe amount of potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires is expected to greatly exceed the amount of PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s insurance coverage for wildfire events. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have $842 million of insurance coverage for liabilities, including wildfire events, for the period from August 1, 2017 through July 31, 2018, subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million per occurrence and further retentions of approximately $40 million per occurrence. During the third quarter of 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility renewed their liability insurance coverage for wildfire events in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.4 billion for the period from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019, comprised of $700 million for general liability (subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million per occurrence), and $700 million for property damages only, which property damage coverage includes an aggregate amount of approximately $200 million through the reinsurance market where a catastrophe bond was utilized. In addition, coverage limits within these wildfire insurance policies could result in further material self-insured costs in the event each fire were deemed to be a separate occurrence under the terms of the insurance policies.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility may not be able to recover the full amount of their insurance. If PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to recover the full amount of their insurance, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. Even if PG&E Corporation and the Utility were to recover the full amount of their insurance, PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect their losses in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires will greatly exceed their available insurance.\nIn addition, it could take a number of years before the Utility\u2019s final liability in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires is known and the Utility could apply for recovery of costs in excess of insurance. While the CPUC has authorized the Utility to track certain wildfire costs in its WEMA, the Utility will be required to submit a separate request with the CPUC in the future for recovery of those costs. The Utility may be unable to fully recover costs in excess of insurance through regulatory mechanisms and, even if such recovery is possible, it could take a number of years to resolve and a number of years to collect.\nIf PG&E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for certain or all of the costs, expenses, and other losses described above with respect to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, the amount of such liability could exceed $30 billion, which amount does not include potential punitive damages, fines and penalties or damages related to future claims. In certain circumstances, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s liability could be substantially greater than such amount. For further discussion of the potential magnitude of PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s liability, see \u201cPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, notwithstanding the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases\u201d and \u201cPG&E Corporation and the Utility are the subject of lawsuits and could be the subject of additional investigations, citations, fines or enforcement actions in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires\u201d above.\nAccordingly, PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect losses in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires will greatly exceed their available insurance. PG&E Corporation and the Utility also expect to face increasing difficulty securing liability insurance in future years due to availability and to face significantly increased insurance costs. PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process.\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the ultimate amount of third-party liability of the Utility in connection with the 2015 Butte fire.\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the ultimate amount of third-party liability that the Utility incurs in connection with the 2015 Butte fire. As described below in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to numerous lawsuits in connection with the 2015 Butte fire by various plaintiffs, including individual plaintiffs, insurance carriers, and various government entities, under multiple theories of liability. Plaintiffs also seek punitive damages. The number of individual claimants may still increase in the future through the Chapter 11 process.\nIn connection with the 2015 Butte fire, the Utility may be liable for property damages, interest, and attorneys\u2019 fees without having been found negligent, through the doctrine of inverse condemnation. (See \u201cThe doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&E Corporation or the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows\u201d below.) In addition, the Utility may be liable for fire suppression costs, personal injury damages, and other damages if the Utility were found to have been negligent. PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process. While the Utility believes it was not negligent, there can be no assurance that a court would agree with the Utility.\nThe Utility currently believes that it is probable that it will incur a loss of $1.1 billion in connection with the 2015 Butte fire. While this amount includes the Utility\u2019s assumptions about fire suppression costs (including its assessment of the Cal Fire loss), it does not include any portion of the estimated claim from the OES. The Utility still does not have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the probable loss it may have for that additional claim. A change in management\u2019s estimates or assumptions could result in an adjustment that could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, as well as PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization. (See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)\nIf the Utility is unable to recover all or a significant portion of its excess costs in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire through ratemaking mechanisms and in a timely manner, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Utility incurred substantial costs in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire in excess of costs currently in rates, some of which currently are or are expected to be recorded in the future in its WEMA, CEMA and FHPMA accounts.\nThere can be no assurance that the Utility will be allowed to recover costs recorded in those accounts in the future, even if a court decision were to determine that the Utility is liable as a result of the application of the doctrine of inverse condemnation. For example, while the CPUC previously approved WEMA tracking accounts for San Diego Gas & Electric Company in 2010, in December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas & Electric Company stated it incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC\u2019s prudent manager standard. San Diego Gas & Electric, the Utility, and Southern California Edison filed requests for rehearing of that decision. On July 12, 2018, the CPUC voted out a decision denying the requests for rehearing. On November 13, 2018, the California Court of Appeal denied San Diego Gas & Electric\u2019s petition for writ of review, and on January 30, 2019, the California Supreme Court denied San Diego Gas & Electric\u2019s petition for review.\nSB 901, signed into law on September 21, 2018, requires the CPUC to establish a customer harm threshold, directing the CPUC to limit certain disallowances in the aggregate, so that they do not exceed the maximum amount that the Utility can pay without harming ratepayers or materially impacting its ability to provide adequate and safe service (the \u201cCustomer Harm Threshold\u201d). SB 901 also authorizes the CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery, through the issuance of recovery bonds (also referred to as \u201csecuritization\u201d), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold. SB 901 does not authorize securitization with respect to possible 2018 Camp fire costs, as the bill does not address fires that occurred in 2018.\nOn January 10, 2019, the CPUC adopted an OIR, which establishes a process to develop criteria and a methodology to inform determinations of the Customer Harm Threshold in future applications under Section 451.2(a) of the Public Utilities Code for cost recovery of 2017 wildfire costs. In the OIR, the CPUC stated that \u201cconsistent with Section 451.2(a), the determination of what costs and expenses are just and reasonable must be made in the context of an application for the recovery of specific costs related to the 2017 wildfires.\u201d Based on the CPUC\u2019s interpretation of Section 451.2 as outlined in the OIR, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that any securitization of costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires would not occur, if at all, until (a) the Utility has paid claims relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires, (b) the Utility has filed application for recovery of such costs, and (c) the CPUC makes a determination that such costs are just and reasonable or in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold. PG&E Corporation and the Utility therefore do not expect the CPUC to permit the Utility to securitize costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires on an expedited or emergency basis. Based on the OIR, as well as prior experience and precedent, and unless the CPUC alters the position expressed in the OIR, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it likely would take years to obtain authorization to securitize any amounts relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires.\nOn February 11, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed opening comments in response to the OIR in which they argued, among other things, the CPUC should (1) promptly set a Customer Harm Threshold, or at least define the methodology for setting the Customer Harm Threshold with sufficient specificity to enable PG&E Corporation and the Utility and potential investors to anticipate that amount; (2) determine the Customer Harm Threshold based on the capital needed to resolve claims arising from both the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires to be provided for in a plan of reorganization; (3) define how the Customer Harm Threshold will be applied to any future wildfires; and (4) establish the Customer Harm Threshold based on the amount of debt PG&E Corporation and the Utility can raise. Based on assumptions set forth in the comments, PG&E Corporation and the Utility indicated that they could borrow up to approximately $3 billion to fund wildfire claims costs as part of a plan of reorganization.\nThe inability to recover all or a significant portion of costs in excess of insurance through increases in rates and by collecting such rates in a timely manner could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of non-compliance with the terms of probation or in the event of modifications to the conditions of probation.\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of non-compliance with the terms of probation or in the event of modifications to the conditions of probation. On January 26, 2017, following the federal criminal trial against the Utility in connection with the San Bruno explosion, in which the Utility was found guilty on six felony counts, the Utility was sentenced to, among other things, a five-year corporate probation period and oversight by a third-party monitor for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early termination after three years. The probation includes a requirement that the Utility not commit any local, state, or federal crimes during the probation period. As part of the probation, the Utility has retained a third-party monitor at the Utility\u2019s expense. The goal of the third-party monitor is to help ensure that the Utility takes reasonable and appropriate steps to maintain the safety of its gas and electric operations, and to maintain effective ethics, compliance and safety related incentive programs on a Utility-wide basis.\nIn 2018 and 2019, the court overseeing the Utility\u2019s probation, issued various orders related to the Utility\u2019s probation. On November 27, 2018, the court issued an order requiring that the Utility, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California and the third-party monitor provide written answers to a series of questions regarding the Utility\u2019s compliance with the terms of its probation. On December 5, 2018, the court issued an order requesting that the Office of the California Attorney General advise the court of its view on \u201cthe extent to which, if at all, the reckless operation or maintenance of PG&E power lines would constitute a crime under California law.\u201d The response of the Utility was submitted on December 31, 2018. On January 3, 2019 and January 4, 2019, the court issued two new orders requesting further information regarding each of the eighteen October 2017 Northern California wildfires that Cal Fire has attributed to the Utility\u2019s facilities, and the Utility submitted its responses on January 10, 2019. On January 9, 2019, the court ordered the Utility to appear in court on January 30, 2019, as a result of the court\u2019s finding that \u201cthere is probable cause to believe there has been a violation of the conditions of supervision\u201d with respect to reporting requirements related to the 2017 Honey fire. In addition, on January 9, 2019, the court issued an order proposing to add new conditions of probation and ordered the Utility to show cause by January 23, 2019, as to why the Utility\u2019s conditions of probation should not be modified as proposed. The Utility's response was submitted on January 23, 2019. On January 30, 2019, the court found that the Utility had violated a condition of its probation with respect to reporting requirements related to the 2017 Honey fire. The court issued an order stating that a sentencing hearing on the probation violation will be set at a later date. For more information about the Utility\u2019s probation and the court\u2019s orders, see \u201cU.S. District Court Matters and Probation\" in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and \"U.S. District Court Matters and Probation\u201d in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Such proceedings are not subject to the automatic stay imposed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThe Utility could incur material costs, not recoverable through rates, in the event of non-compliance with the terms of its probation and in connection with the monitorship (including but not limited to costs resulting from recommendations of the third-party monitor). The Utility could also incur material costs, not recoverable through rates, in the event of modifications to the conditions of its probation.\nThe Utility\u2019s conviction and the outcome of probation could harm the Utility\u2019s relationships with customers, regulators, legislators, communities, business partners, or other constituencies and make it more difficult to recruit qualified personnel and senior management. Further, they could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings, for example, by enabling parties to argue that the Utility should not be allowed to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the criminal charges on which the Utility was found guilty. They could also result in increased regulatory or legislative scrutiny with respect to various aspects of how the Utility\u2019s business is conducted or organized. (See \u201cEnforcement and Litigation Matters\u201d in Item 7. MD&A.)\nThe doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&E Corporation or the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nCalifornia law includes a doctrine of inverse condemnation that is routinely invoked in California. Inverse condemnation imposes strict liability (including liability for attorneys\u2019 fees) for damages as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities, including utilities\u2019 electric transmission lines. Courts have imposed liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders against utilities on the grounds that losses borne by the person whose property was damaged through a public use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefitted from such undertaking, and based on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers. Plaintiffs have asserted the doctrine of inverse condemnation in lawsuits related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire, and it is possible that plaintiffs could be successful in convincing courts to apply this doctrine in these or other litigations. For example, on June 22, 2017, the Superior Court for the County of Sacramento found that the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies to the Utility with respect to the 2015 Butte fire. Although the Utility has filed a renewed motion for a legal determination of inverse condemnation liability, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in its arguments that the doctrine of inverse condemnation does not apply in the 2015 Butte fire or other litigation against PG&E Corporation or the Utility.\nFurthermore, a court could determine that the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies even in the absence of an open CPUC proceeding for cost recovery, or before a potential cost recovery decision is issued by the CPUC. Although the imposition of liability is premised on the assumption that utilities have the ability to automatically recover these costs from their customers, there can be no guarantee that the CPUC would authorize cost recovery whether or not a previous court decision imposes liability on a utility under the doctrine of inverse condemnation. In December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas & Electric Company stated it incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC\u2019s prudent manager standard. That determination is being challenged by San Diego Gas & Electric as well as by the Utility and Southern California Edison.\nIf PG&E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for damage under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, but is unable to secure a cost recovery decision from the CPUC to pay for such costs through increases in rates or to collect such rates in a timely manner, the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows of PG&E Corporation and the Utility would be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. (See \u201cPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, notwithstanding the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases\u201d, \u201cPG&E Corporation and the Utility are the subject of lawsuits and could be the subject of additional investigations, citations, fines or enforcement actions in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires\u201d and \u201cPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the ultimate amount of third-party liability of the Utility in connection with the 2015 Butte fire\u201d above.)\nRisks Related to the Outcome of Other Enforcement Matters, Investigations, and Regulatory Proceedings\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results could be materially affected as a result of legislative and regulatory developments.\nThe Utility\u2019s financial results could be materially affected as a result of SB 901 adopted in 2018 by the California legislature. In December 2018, the CPUC opened an OIR in connection with SB 901 that will adopt criteria and a methodology for use by the CPUC in future applications for cost recovery of wildfire costs. Following SB 901, in applications for cost recovery in connection with the 2017 wildfires, the CPUC is expected to consider the Utility\u2019s financial status and determine the maximum amount the Utility can pay without harming customers or materially impacting its ability to provide adequate and safe service, and ensure that the costs or expenses that are disallowed for recovery in rates assessed for the wildfires, in the aggregate, do not exceed that amount. The Utility is unable to predict the timing or outcome of such future determination by the CPUC and its impact on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nIn addition, SB 901 requires utilities to submit annual wildfire mitigation plans for approval by the CPUC on a schedule to be established by the CPUC. SB 901 establishes factors to be considered by the CPUC when setting penalties for failure to substantially comply with the plan. The Utility is unable to predict the timing or outcome of the CPUC\u2019s review of the wildfire mitigation plan, the results of the CPUC compliance review of wildfire mitigation plan implementation, or the timing or extent of cost recovery for wildfire mitigation plan activities. (See \u201cRegulatory Matters - Other Regulatory Proceedings\u201d in Item 7. MD&A.)\nFinally, SB 901 established a Commission on Catastrophic Wildfire Cost and Recovery to evaluate wildfire reforms, including inverse condemnation reform, a potential state wildfire insurance fund, and other wildfire mitigation measures. The recommendations of the CPUC and the response by the Governor and legislature to those recommendations could materially affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. (See \u201cRegulatory Matters - Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives\u201d in Item 7. MD&A.)\nThe Utility is subject to extensive regulations and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with such regulations, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the outcomes of the CPUC\u2019s investigative enforcement proceedings against the Utility, other known enforcement matters, and other ongoing state and federal investigations and requests for information. The Utility could incur material costs and fines in connection with compliance with penalties from closed investigations or enforcement actions or in connection with future investigations, citations, audits, or enforcement actions.\nThe Utility is subject to extensive regulations, including federal, state and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations, and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with such regulations. The Utility could incur material charges, including fines and other penalties, in connection with the ex parte OII, safety culture OII, the locate and mark OII, and other matters that the CPUC\u2019s SED may be investigating. The SED could launch investigations at any time on any issue it deems appropriate. Such proceedings are likely not subject to the automatic stay imposed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases; however, collection efforts in connection with fines or penalties arising out of such proceedings are stayed.\nThe SED has discretion whether to issue a penalty for each violation, but if it assesses a penalty for a violation, it is required to impose the maximum statutory penalty of $50,000, with an administrative limit of $8 million per citation issued. For offenses occurred after January 1, 2019, the maximum statutory penalty is $100,000, as provided in SB 901. The SED may, at its discretion, impose penalties on a daily basis, or on less than a daily basis, for violations that continued for more than one day. While it is uncertain how the CPUC will calculate the number of violations or the penalty for any violations, such fines or penalties could be significant and materially affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s liquidity and results of operations. (See \u201cRegulatory Environment\u201d in Item 1. Business and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)\nThe Utility also is a target of a number of investigations, in addition to certain investigations in connection with the wildfires. (See \"Risks Related to Wildfires,\" above.) In 2014, both the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco and the California Attorney General's office opened investigations into matters related to allegedly improper communication between the Utility and CPUC personnel. The Utility also is unable to predict the outcome of, or costs and expenses associate with, pending investigations, including whether any charges will be brought against the Utility.\nIf these investigations result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalties the amount of which could be substantial and, in the event of a judgment against the Utility, suffer further ongoing negative consequences. Furthermore, a negative outcome in any of these investigations, or future enforcement actions, could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings to which the Utility may be subject; for example, by enabling parties to challenge the Utility\u2019s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the Utility\u2019s violations. (See also \u201cPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of non-compliance with the terms of probation or in the event of modifications to the conditions of probation\u201d above.)\nThe Utility could be subject to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state or local laws, regulations or orders that could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and resource adequacy requirements; customer billing; customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construction, operating and maintenance practices; safety and inspection practices; compliance with CPUC general orders or other applicable CPUC decisions or regulations; federal electric reliability standards; and environmental compliance. CPUC staff could also impose penalties on the Utility in the future in accordance with its authority under the gas and electric safety citation programs. The amount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results primarily depend on the outcomes of regulatory and ratemaking proceedings and the Utility\u2019s ability to manage its operating expenses and capital expenditures so that it is able to earn its authorized rate of return in a timely manner.\nAs a regulated entity, the Utility\u2019s rates are set by the CPUC or the FERC on a prospective basis and are generally designed to allow the Utility to collect sufficient revenues to recover reasonable costs of providing service, including a return on its capital investments. PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results could be materially affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility to safely and reliably serve its customers and earn its authorized ROE. The outcome of the Utility\u2019s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the level of opposition by intervening parties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of the Utility\u2019s regulators, consumer and other stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility\u2019s ability to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gas services. Further, the increasing amount of Reliability Must Run (\u201cRMR\u201d) electric generation in the CAISO could increase the Utility\u2019s costs of procuring capacity needed for reliable service to its customers.\nIn addition to the amount of authorized revenues, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility\u2019s actual costs to safely and reliably serve its customers differ from authorized or forecast costs. The Utility may incur additional costs for many reasons including changing market circumstances, unanticipated events (such as wildfires, storms, earthquakes, accidents, or catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility\u2019s operations), or compliance with new state laws or policies. Although the Utility may be allowed to recover some or all of the additional costs, there may be a substantial time lag between when the Utility incurs the costs and when the Utility is authorized to collect revenues to recover such costs. Alternatively, the CPUC or the FERC may disallow costs that they determine were not reasonably or prudently incurred by the Utility.\nThe Utility also is required to incur costs to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, such as those relating to the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure, the deployment of distributed energy resources, implementation of demand response and customer energy efficiency programs, energy storage and renewable energy targets, underground gas storage, and the construction of the California high-speed rail project. The Utility\u2019s ability to recover costs, including its investments, associated with these and other legislative and regulatory initiatives will depend, in large part, on the final form of legislative or regulatory requirements, and whether the associated ratemaking mechanisms can be timely adjusted to reflect a lower customer demand for the Utility\u2019s electricity and natural gas services.\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results depend upon the Utility\u2019s continuing ability to recover \u201cpass-through\u201d costs, including electricity and natural gas procurement costs, from customers in a timely manner. The CPUC may disallow procurement costs for a variety of reasons. In addition, the Utility\u2019s ability to recover these costs could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreased new customer growth, if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility\u2019s rates to reflect such events.\nThe Utility meets customer demand for electricity from a variety of sources, including electricity generated from the Utility\u2019s own generation facilities, electricity provided by third parties under power purchase agreements, and purchases on the wholesale electricity market. The Utility must manage these sources using the commercial and CPUC regulatory principles of \u201cleast cost dispatch\u201d and prudent administration of power purchase agreements in compliance with its CPUC-approved long-term procurement plan. The CPUC could disallow procurement costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the Utility did not comply with these principles or if the Utility did not comply with its procurement plan.\nFurther, the contractual prices for electricity under the Utility\u2019s current or future power purchase agreements could become uneconomic in the future for a variety of reasons, including developments in alternative energy technology, increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, and lower customer demand due to adverse economic conditions or the loss of the Utility\u2019s customers to other retail providers. Despite the CPUC\u2019s current approval of the contracts, the CPUC could disallow contract costs in the future if it determines that the terms of such contracts, including price, do not meet the CPUC reasonableness standard.\nThe Utility\u2019s ability to recover the costs it incurs in the wholesale electricity market may be affected by whether the CAISO wholesale electricity market continues to function effectively. Although market mechanisms are designed to limit excessive prices, these market mechanisms could fail, or the related systems and software on which the market mechanisms rely may not perform as intended which could result in excessive market prices. The CPUC could prohibit the Utility from passing through the higher costs of electricity to customers.\nFurther, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreasing bundled load that occurs through municipalization of the Utility\u2019s facilities, an increase in the number of CCAs who provide electricity to their residents, and an increase in the number of consumers who become direct access customers of alternative generation providers. (See \u201cCompetition in the Electricity Industry\u201d in Item 1.) As the number of bundled customers (i.e., those customers who receive electricity and distribution service from the Utility) declines, the rates for remaining customers could increase as the Utility would have a smaller customer base from which to recover certain procurement costs. Although the Utility is permitted to collect non-bypassable charges for above market generation-related costs incurred on behalf of former customers, the charges may not be sufficient for the Utility to fully recover these costs. In addition, the Utility\u2019s ability to collect non-bypassable charges has been, and may continue to be, challenged by certain customer groups. Furthermore, if the former customers return to receiving electricity supply from the Utility, the Utility could incur costs to meet their electricity needs that it may not be able to timely recover through rates or that it may not be able to recover at all.\nIn addition, increasing levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer NEM, which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, puts upward rate pressure on remaining customers, who may incur significantly higher bills due to an increase in customers seeking alternative energy providers.\nA confluence of technology-related cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage a viable, cost-effective alternative to the Utility\u2019s bundled electric service which could further threaten the Utility\u2019s ability to recover its generation, transmission, and distribution investments. If the number of the Utility\u2019s customers decreases or grows at a slower rate than anticipated, the Utility\u2019s level of authorized capital investment could decline as well, leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer migration to other energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could materially affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nFurther, changes in commodity prices also may have an adverse effect on the Utility\u2019s ability to timely recover its operating costs and earn its authorized ROE. Although the Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers as \u201cpass-through\u201d costs, a significant and sustained rise in commodity prices could create overall rate pressures that make it more difficult for the Utility to recover its costs that are not categorized as \u201cpass-through\u201d costs. To relieve some of this upward rate pressure, the CPUC could authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or disallow full cost recovery.\nIf the Utility is unable to recover a material portion of its procurement costs and/or if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility\u2019s rates to reflect the impact of changing loads, the wide deployment of distributed generation, and the development of new electricity generation and energy storage technologies, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.\nRisks Related to Operations and Information Technology\nThe Utility\u2019s electricity and natural gas operations are inherently hazardous and involve significant risks which, if they materialize, can materially affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nThe Utility owns and operates extensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generating system. (See \u201cElectric Utility Operations\u201d and \u201cNatural Gas Utility Operations\u201d in Item 1. Business above.) The Utility\u2019s ability to earn its authorized ROE depends on its ability to efficiently maintain, operate, and protect its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably. The Utility undertakes substantial capital investment projects to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities. In addition, the Utility is obligated to decommission its electricity generation facilities at the end of their useful operating lives, and the CPUC approved retirement of Diablo Canyon by 2024 and 2025.\nThe Utility\u2019s ability to safely and reliably operate, maintain, construct and decommission its facilities is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond the Utility\u2019s control, including those that arise from:\n\u2022\nthe breakdown or failure of equipment, electric transmission or distribution lines, or natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines, that can cause explosions, fires, or other catastrophic events;\n\u2022\nan overpressure event occurring on natural gas facilities due to equipment failure, incorrect operating procedures or failure to follow correct operating procedures, or welding or fabrication-related defects, that results in the failure of downstream transmission pipelines or distribution assets and uncontained natural gas flow;\n\u2022\nthe failure to maintain adequate capacity to meet customer demand on the gas system that results in customer curtailments, controlled/uncontrolled gas outages, gas surges back into homes, serious personal injury or loss of life;\n\u2022\na prolonged statewide electrical black-out that results in damage to the Utility\u2019s equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other third parties;\n\u2022\nthe failure to fully identify, evaluate, and control workplace hazards that result in serious injury or loss of life for employees or the public, environmental damage, or reputational damage;\n\u2022\nthe release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act;\n\u2022\nthe failure of a large dam or other major hydroelectric facility, or the failure of one or more levees that protect land on which the Utility\u2019s assets are built;\n\u2022\nthe failure to take expeditious or sufficient action to mitigate operating conditions, facilities, or equipment, that the Utility has identified, or reasonably should have identified, as unsafe, which failure then leads to a catastrophic event (such as a wild land fire or natural gas explosion);\n\u2022\ninadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to respond effectively to a catastrophic event that can lead to public or employee harm or extended outages;\n\u2022\noperator or other human error;\n\u2022\nan ineffective records management program that results in the failure to construct, operate and maintain a utility system safely and prudently;\n\u2022\nconstruction performed by third parties that damages the Utility\u2019s underground or overhead facilities, including, for example, ground excavations or \u201cdig-ins\u201d that damage the Utility\u2019s underground pipelines;\n\u2022\nthe release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or soil, including, for example, gas leaks from natural gas storage facilities; flaking lead-based paint from the Utility\u2019s facilities, and leaking or spilled insulating fluid from electrical equipment; and\n\u2022\nattacks by third parties, including cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, vandalism, or war.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could interrupt fuel supplies; affect demand for electricity or natural gas; cause unplanned outages or reduce generating output; damage the Utility\u2019s assets or operations; damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies; damage property owned by customers or others; and cause personal injury or death. As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore service, and to compensate third parties. Any of such incidents also could lead to significant claims against the Utility.\nFurther, although the Utility often enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities or the construction or demolition or facilities, the Utility may retain liability for the quality and completion of the contractor\u2019s work and can be subject to penalties or other enforcement action if the contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders. The Utility may also be subject to liability, penalties or other enforcement action as a result of personal injury or death caused by third-party contractor actions.\nInsurance, equipment warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery under all circumstances or against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject. An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nThe Utility\u2019s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses caused by an operating failure or catastrophic events, including severe weather events, or may not be available at a reasonable cost, or available at all.\nThe Utility has experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise from the Utility\u2019s ordinary operations. PG&E Corporation, the Utility or its contractors and customers could continue to experience coverage reductions and/or increased wildfire insurance costs in future years. No assurance can be given that future losses will not exceed the limits of the Utility\u2019s insurance coverage. Uninsured losses and increases in the cost of insurance may not be recoverable in customer rates. A loss that is not fully insured or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nAs a result of the potential application to investor-owned utilities of a strict liability standard under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, recent losses recorded by insurance companies, the risk of increased wildfires including as a result of the ongoing drought, the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires, and the 2015 Butte fire, the Utility may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future at a reasonable cost, or at all. In addition, the Utility is unable to predict whether it would be allowed to recover in rates the increased costs of insurance or the costs of any uninsured losses.\nIf the amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, or if the Utility is unable to obtain insurance at a reasonable cost or recover in rates the costs of any uninsured losses, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.\nThe electric power industry is undergoing significant change driven by technological advancements and a decarbonized economy, which could materially affect the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nThe electric power industry is undergoing transformative change driven by technological advancements enabling customer choice (for example, customer-owned generation and energy storage) and state climate policy supporting a decarbonized economy. The electric grid is a critical enabler of the adoption of new energy technologies that support California's climate change and GHG reduction objectives, which continue to be publicly supported by California policymakers. California's environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of the industry change. For instance, SB 100, which was signed into law on September 10, 2018, increases from 50% to 60%, the percentage of California\u2019s electricity portfolio that must come from renewables by 2030. SB 100 establishes a further goal to have an electric grid that is entirely powered by clean energy by 2045. California utilities also are experiencing increasing deployment by customers and third parties of DERs, such as on-site solar generation, energy storage, fuel cells, energy efficiency, and demand response technologies. These developments will require modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate two-way flows of electricity, increase the grid's capacity, and interconnect DERs.\nIn order to enable the California clean energy economy, sustained investments are required in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy storage options, EV infrastructure and state infrastructure modernization (e.g. rail and water projects).\nTo this end, the CPUC is conducting proceedings to: evaluate changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higher penetration of DERs and, consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments; evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by DERs, and if feasible, what, if any, compensation to utilities would be appropriate for enabling those investments; and clarify the role of the electric distribution grid operator. The CPUC also authorized development of two new, five-year programs aimed at accelerating widespread electric vehicle adoption and combating climate change. The new programs will increase fast charging options for consumers as well as electric charging infrastructure for non-light-duty fleet vehicles.\nThe industry change, costs associated with complying with new regulatory developments and initiatives and with technological advancements, or the Utility\u2019s inability to successfully adapt to changes in the electric industry, could materially affect the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nA cyber incident, cyber security breach, severe natural event or physical attack on the Utility\u2019s operational networks and information technology systems could have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nThe Utility\u2019s electricity and natural gas systems rely on a complex, interconnected network of generation, transmission, distribution, control, and communication technologies, which can be damaged by natural events-such as severe weather or seismic events-and by malicious events, such as cyber and physical attacks. Private and public entities, such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and U.S. Government Departments, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Energy, and the White House, have noted that cyber-attacks targeting utility systems are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency. The Utility\u2019s operational networks also may face new cyber security risks due to modernizing and interconnecting the existing infrastructure with new technologies and control systems. Any failure or decrease in the functionality of the Utility\u2019s operational networks could cause harm to the public or employees, significantly disrupt operations, negatively impact the Utility\u2019s ability to safely generate, transport, deliver and store energy and gas or otherwise operate in the most safe and efficient manner or at all, and damage the Utility\u2019s assets or operations or those of third parties.\nThe Utility also relies on complex information technology systems that allow it to create, collect, use, disclose, store and otherwise process sensitive information, including the Utility\u2019s financial information, customer energy usage and billing information, and personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, contractors, and other individuals. In addition, the Utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems, and to provide other services to the Utility or the Utility\u2019s customers. In addition, the Utility is increasingly being required to disclose large amounts of data (including customer energy usage and personal information regarding customers) to support changes to California\u2019s electricity market related to grid modernization and customer choice. These third-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utility\u2019s systems and information, or experience security incidents or inadequate security measures. Any incidents or disruptions in the Utility\u2019s information technology systems could impact the Utility\u2019s ability to track or collect revenues and to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting.\nThe Utility and its third-party vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, breaches and attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Utility\u2019s information technology systems or confidential data (including information about customers and employees), or to disrupt the Utility\u2019s operations. None of these breaches or attempts has individually or in the aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be able to prevent the unauthorized access to its operational networks, information technology systems or data, or the disruption of its operations. Such events could subject the Utility to significant expenses, claims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, investigations, and regulatory actions that could result in material fines and penalties, loss of customers and harm to PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s reputation, any of which could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nThe Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents. However, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance will continue to be available at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates.\nThe operation and decommissioning of the Utility\u2019s nuclear generation facilities expose it to potentially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able to fully recover its costs if regulatory requirements change or the plant ceases operations before the licenses expire.\nThe operation of the Utility\u2019s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such as risks relating to the storage, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act. If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance available, such losses could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the Utility may be required under federal law to pay up to $275 million of liabilities arising out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility\u2019s Diablo Canyon facility but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States.\nOn January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved the retirement of Diablo Canyon units by 2024 and 2025. However, the Utility continues to face public concern about the safety of nuclear generation and nuclear fuel. Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging the actions of the NRC and urging governmental entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power. Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail, regulatory proceedings may take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete. It is also possible that public pressure could grow leading to adverse changes in legislation, regulations, orders, or their interpretation. As a result, operations at the Utility\u2019s two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon could cease before their respective licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecovered investment and such charge could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation's and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nIn addition, in order to retain highly skilled personnel necessary to safely operate Diablo Canyon during the remaining years of operations, the Utility will incur costs in connection with (i) an employee retention program to ensure adequate staffing levels at Diablo Canyon, and (ii) an employee retraining and development program, to facilitate redeployment of a portion of Diablo Canyon personnel to the decommissioning project and elsewhere in the Utility. In its January 11, 2018 decision, the CPUC authorized rate recovery up to $211.3 million and in its November 29, 2018 decision, the CPUC authorized rate recovery up to $352.1 million as originally requested by the Utility for an employee retention program, but there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in retaining highly skilled personnel under such program.\nThe Utility has incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders. (See \u201cRegulatory Environment\u201d in Item 1. Business above.) If the Utility were unable to recover these costs, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results could be materially affected. The Utility may determine that it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC may order the Utility to cease operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions. The Utility may incur a material charge if it ceases operations at Diablo Canyon\u2019s two nuclear generation units before their respective licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. At December 31, 2018, the Utility\u2019s unrecovered investment in Diablo Canyon was $1.7 billion.\nThe Utility also has an obligation to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, at the end of their useful lives. (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - \"Asset Retirement Obligations\" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8.) The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover its estimated costs to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear decommissioning charges that are collected from customers and held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit. If the Utility\u2019s actual decommissioning costs, including the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.\nFor certain critical technologies, products and services, the Utility relies on a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, sole suppliers. In the event these suppliers are unable to perform, the Utility could experience delays and disruptions in its operations while it transitions to alternative plans or suppliers.\nThe Utility relies on a limited number of sole source suppliers for certain of its technologies, products and services. Although the Utility has long-term agreements with such suppliers, if the suppliers are unable to deliver these technologies, products or services, the Utility could experience delays and disruptions while it implements alternative plans and makes arrangements with acceptable substitute suppliers. As a result, the Utility\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially affected. As an example, the Utility relies on Westinghouse Electric Company LLC (recently acquired by Brookfield Business Partners L.P.) for its nuclear fuel assemblies, and Silver Spring Networks, Inc. and Aclara Technologies LLC as suppliers of proprietary SmartMeter\u2122 devices and software, and of managed services, utilized in its advanced metering system that collects electric and natural gas usage data from customers. If these suppliers encounter performance difficulties or are unable to supply these devices or maintain and update their software, or provide other services to maintain these systems, the Utility\u2019s metering, billing, and electric network operations could be impacted and disrupted.\nRisks Related to Environmental Factors\nSevere weather conditions, extended drought and shifting climate patterns could materially affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nExtreme weather, extended drought and shifting climate patterns have intensified the challenges associated with wildfire management in California. The Utility's service territory encompasses some of the most densely forested areas in California and, as a consequence, is subject to higher risk from vegetation-related ignition events than other California IOUs. Further, environmental extremes, such as drought conditions followed by periods of wet weather, can drive additional vegetation growth (which can then fuel fires) and influence both the likelihood and severity of extraordinary wildfire events. In California, over the past five years, inconsistent and extreme precipitation, coupled with more hot days, have increased the wildfire risk and made wildfire outbreaks increasingly difficult to manage. In particular, the risk posed by wildfires has increased in the Utility\u2019s service area as a result of an extended period of drought, bark beetle infestations in the California forest and wildfire fuel increases due to record rainfall following the drought, and strong wind events, among other environmental factors. Contributing factors other than environmental can include local land use policies and historical forestry management practices. The combined effects of extreme weather and climate change also impact this risk. For example, in 2017, there were nearly double the number of wildfires than the annual average, including five of the most devastating wildfires in California's history. On January 19, 2018, the CPUC approved a statewide fire-threat map that shows that approximately half of the Utility's service territory is facing \"elevated\" or \"extreme\" fire danger. Approximately 25,000 circuit miles of the Utility's nearly 81,000 distribution overhead circuit miles and approximately 5,500 miles of the nearly 18,000 transmission overhead circuit miles are in such high-fire threat areas, significantly more in total than other California IOUs.\nSevere weather events and other natural disasters, including wildfires and other fires, storms, tornadoes, floods, heat waves, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis, rising sea levels, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic events, or other natural disasters such as wildfires, could result in severe business disruptions, prolonged power outages, property damage, injuries or loss of life, significant decreases in revenues and earnings, and/or significant additional costs to PG&E Corporation and the Utility. Any such event could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Any of such events also could lead to significant claims against the Utility. Further, these events could result in regulatory penalties and disallowances, particularly if the Utility encounters difficulties in restoring power to its customers on a timely basis or if the related losses are found to be the result of the Utility\u2019s practices and/or the failure of electric and other equipment of the Utility.\nFurther, the Utility has been studying the potential effects of climate change (increased temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, rising sea levels) on the Utility\u2019s operations and is developing contingency plans to adapt to those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant. Scientists project that climate change will increase electricity demand due to more extreme, persistent and hot weather. As a result, the Utility\u2019s hydroelectric generation could change and the Utility would need to consider managing or acquiring additional generation. If the Utility increases its reliance on conventional generation resources to replace hydroelectric generation and to meet increased customer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comply with GHG emissions limits. In addition, flooding caused by rising sea levels could damage the Utility\u2019s facilities, including gas, generation, and electric transmission and distribution assets. The Utility could incur substantial costs to repair or replace facilities, restore service, or compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries. The Utility anticipates that the increased costs would be recovered through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-recovery may increase.\nEvents or conditions caused by climate change could have a greater impact on the Utility\u2019s operations than the Utility\u2019s studies suggest and could result in lower revenues or increased expenses, or both. If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility\u2019s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.\nThe Utility\u2019s operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and changes in or liabilities under these laws could adversely affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results.\nThe Utility\u2019s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and orders, relating to air quality, water quality and usage, remediation of hazardous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife. The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules, and regulations. The Utility has been in the past, and may be in the future, required to pay for environmental remediation costs at sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws. Although the Utility has recorded liabilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination, remediation alternatives, the applicable remediation levels, and the financial ability of other potentially responsible parties. (For more information, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)\nEnvironmental remediation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and more expansive application of existing environmental regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses or permits issued by environmental or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or other sanctions.\nThe CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms. One of these mechanisms allows the Utility rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review. The CPUC may discontinue or change these ratemaking mechanisms in the future or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover in rates.\nSome of the Utility\u2019s environmental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through rates or insurance. (See \u201cEnvironmental Regulation\u201d in Item 1. and Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) The Utility\u2019s costs to remediate groundwater contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination have had, and may continue to have, a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results. Their financial results also can be materially affected by changes in estimated costs and by the extent to which actual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities.\nState climate policy requires reductions in greenhouse gases of 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. Various proposals for addressing these reductions have the potential to reduce natural gas usage and increase natural gas costs. The future recovery of the increased costs associated with compliance is uncertain.\nThe CARB is the state\u2019s primary regulator for GHG emission reduction programs. Natural gas providers have been subject to compliance with CARB\u2019s Cap-and-Trade Program since 2015, and natural gas end-use customers have an increasing exposure to carbon costs under the Program through 2030 when the full cost will be reflected in customer bills. CARB\u2019s Scoping Plan also proposes various methods of reducing GHG emissions from natural gas. These include more aggressive energy efficiency programs to reduce natural gas end use, increased renewable portfolio standards generation in the electric sector reducing noncore gas load, and replacement of natural gas appliances with electric appliances, leading to further reduced demand. These natural gas load reductions may be partially offset by CARB\u2019s proposals to deploy natural gas to replace wood fuel in home heating and diesel in transportation applications. CARB also proposes a displacement of some conventional natural gas with above-market renewable natural gas. The combination of reduced load and increased costs could result in higher natural gas customer bills and a potential mandate to deliver renewable natural gas could lead to cost recovery risk.\nOther Risk Factors\nThe Utility may be required to incur substantial costs in order to obtain or renew licenses and permits needed to operate the Utility\u2019s business and the Utility may be subject to fines and penalties for failure to comply or obtain license renewal.\nThe Utility must comply with the terms of various governmental permits, authorizations, and licenses, including those issued by the FERC for the continued operation of the Utility\u2019s hydroelectric generation facilities, and those issued by environmental and other federal, state and local governmental agencies. Many of the Utility\u2019s capital investment projects, and some maintenance activities, often require the Utility to obtain land use, construction, environmental, or other governmental permits. These permits, authorizations, and licenses may be difficult to obtain on a timely basis, causing work delays. Further, existing permits and licenses could be revoked or modified by the agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed when they were issued. In addition, the Utility often seeks periodic renewal of a license or permit, such as a waste discharge permit or a FERC operating license for a hydroelectric generation facility.\nIf a license or permit is not renewed for a particular facility and the Utility is required to cease operations at that facility, the Utility could incur an impairment charge or other costs. Before renewing a permit or license, the issuing agency may impose additional requirements that may increase the Utility\u2019s compliance costs. In particular, in connection with a license renewal for one or more of the Utility\u2019s hydroelectric generation facilities or assets, the FERC may impose new license conditions that could, among other things, require increased expenditures or result in reduced electricity output and/or capacity at the facility.\nIn addition, local governments may attempt to assert jurisdiction over various utility operations by requiring permits or other approvals that the Utility has not been previously required to obtain.\nThe Utility may incur penalties and sanctions for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of licenses and permits which could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. If the Utility cannot obtain, renew, or comply with necessary governmental permits, authorizations, licenses, ordinances, or other requirements, or if the Utility cannot recover the increase in associated compliance and other costs in a timely manner, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.\nPoor investment performance or other factors could require PG&E Corporation and the Utility to make significant unplanned contributions to its pension plan, other postretirement benefits plans, and nuclear decommissioning trusts.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits for eligible employees and retirees. The Utility also maintains three trusts for the purposes of providing funds to decommission its nuclear facilities. The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of plan assets and trust assets. A decline in the market value may increase the funding requirements for these plans and trusts. The cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels, the rate of return on plan assets, employee demographics, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, future government regulation, and prior contributions to the plans. Similarly, funding requirements for the nuclear decommissioning trusts are affected by the rates of return on trust assets, changes in the laws or regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning or decommissioning funding requirements as well as changes in assumptions or forecasts related to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment. (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) If the Utility is required to make significant unplanned contributions to fund the pension and postretirement plans or if actual nuclear decommissioning costs exceed the amount of nuclear decommissioning trust funds and the Utility is unable to recover the contributions or additional costs in rates, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.\nThe Utility\u2019s success depends on the availability of the services of a qualified workforce and its ability to maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements which cover a substantial number of employees. PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s results may suffer if the Utility is unable to attract and retain qualified personnel and senior management talent, or if prolonged labor disruptions occur.\nThe Utility\u2019s workforce is aging and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years. Although the Utility has undertaken efforts to recruit and train new field service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel. The majority of the Utility\u2019s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with three unions. Labor disruptions could occur depending on the outcome of negotiations to renew the terms of these agreements with the unions or if tentative new agreements are not ratified by their members. In addition, some of the remaining non-represented Utility employees could join one of these unions in the future.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility also may face challenges in attracting and retaining senior management talent especially if they are unable to restore the reputational harm generated by the negative publicity stemming from the ongoing enforcement proceedings and the Chapter 11 Cases. Any such occurrences could materially affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nThe Utility\u2019s business activities are concentrated in one region, as a result of which, its future performance may be affected by events and factors unique to California.\nThe Utility\u2019s business activities are concentrated in Northern California. As a result, the Utility\u2019s future performance may be affected by events and economic factors unique to California or by regional regulation or legislation, for example the doctrine of inverse condemnation. (See \u201cThe doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows\u201d above.)", "PERMNO": 13688, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "PCG"}
