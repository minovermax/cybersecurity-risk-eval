Risk Factors\nA wide range of factors could materially affect our performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results elsewhere in this report, the following factors, among others, could adversely affect our business, including our results of operations or financial position:\n\u2022 Substantial debt and debt service requirements. The amount of our debt could have important consequences. For example, it could: increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limit our ability to fund future capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate requirements; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity.\n\u2022 Borrowing and compliance with covenants under our credit facility. Our credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants, and default provisions. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our current credit agreement, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders were to accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our asset based credit facility and our other indebtedness. Also, should there be an event of default, or a need to obtain waivers following an event of default, we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and/or more restrictive covenants in future periods. Further, the amount available for borrowing under our asset-based revolving loan facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is determined taking into account, among other things, our accounts receivable, inventory and machinery and equipment. Fluctuations in our borrowing base impact our ability to borrow funds pursuant to the revolving loan facility.\n\u2022 Significant volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets. Volatility in the global capital and credit markets has in recent years resulted in a tightening of business credit and liquidity, a contraction of consumer credit, business failures, increased unemployment and declines in consumer confidence and spending. If global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate or remain weak for an extended period of time, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In particular, lower consumer spending may result in reduced demand and orders for certain of our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, increased inventories, and lower gross margins. Further, if our customers experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in further reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, inability of customers to timely meet their payment obligations to us, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense; and a severe financial difficulty experienced by our customers may cause them to become insolvent or cease business operations.\n\u2022 The strength of the retail economy in the United States and abroad. Our business is subject to economic conditions in major markets in which we operate, including recession, inflation, deflation, general weakness in retail, industrial, and housing markets, as well as the exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption laws in various countries, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, currency instability, transportation delays or interruptions, sovereign debt uncertainties and difficulties in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights, as well as natural disasters. The strength of such markets is a function of many factors beyond our control, including interest rates, employment levels, availability of credit and consumer confidence.\n\u2022 Supply chain disruptions. Any difficulty or inability on the part of manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain in obtaining sufficient financing to purchase raw materials or to finance general working capital needs or their inability to obtain raw materials due to shortages or other factors, may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products. Additionally, material increases in raw material commodity prices could further adversely affect our results of operations and financial position; Our foreign suppliers may encounter interruption in their ability to continue to provide us with products on a short-term or long-term basis. Although we believe that there are redundant sources available and maintain multiple sources for most of our products, there may be costs and delays associated with securing such sources and there can be no assurance that such sources would provide the same quality of product at similar prices.\n\u2022 Our ability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with key customers. We have several key customers, two of which collectively accounted for approximately 35.3% of our 2014 consolidated revenue. Loss of key customers or a material negative change in our relationships with our key customers (including as a result of a negative change in the financial position of such key customers) could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial position.\n\u2022 Adverse changes in currency exchange rates A majority of our products are manufactured outside the United States, a portion of which are purchased in the local currency. As a result, we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the United States dollar which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. We believe our most significant foreign currency exposures are the Taiwan dollar (\u201cTWD\u201d) and the Chinese Renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d). Purchases from Chinese sources are made in U.S. dollars (\u201cUSD\u201d). However, if the RMB were to be revalued against the dollar, there could be a significant negative impact on the cost of our products. Further, the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the USD. Certain of the company\u2019s assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the USD. In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into USDs at applicable exchange rates. Increases or decreases in exchange rates between the USD and other currencies affect the USD value of those items, as reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the USD could have a significant impact on the company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, cash generated in non-U.S. jurisdictions may be difficult to repatriate to the United States in a tax-efficient manner.\n\u2022 Impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill. The inability of certain of our subsidiaries to generate future cash flows sufficient to support the recorded amounts of goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets related to those subsidiaries could result in future impairment charges.\n\u2022 Unforeseen inventory adjustments or changes in purchasing patterns. We make purchasing decisions based upon a number of factors including an assessment of market needs and preferences, manufacturing lead times and cash flow considerations. To the extent that our assumptions result in inventory levels being too high or too low, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial position.\n\u2022 Market acceptance of products. There can be no assurance that the market continues its acceptance of the products we introduced in recent years or will accept new products (including the introduction of products into new geographic markets) introduced or scheduled for introduction in 2015. There can also be no assurance that the level of sales generated from these new products or geographic markets relative to our expectations will materialize.\n\u2022 Competition. The markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive on the basis of price, quality, availability, post-sale service and brand-name awareness. A number of competing companies are well-established manufacturers that compete on a global basis.\n\u2022 Price reductions. Price reductions taken by us in response to customer and competitive pressures, as well as price reductions or promotional actions taken in order to drive demand, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial position.\n\u2022 Interest rates. Interest rate fluctuations and other capital market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial position.\n\u2022 Litigation and insurance. The effects of litigation and product liability exposure, as well as other risks and uncertainties described from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our public announcements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial position. Further, while we maintain insurance policies to protect against most potential exposures, events may arise against which we may not be adequately insured.\n\u2022 Retention of key personnel. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of our key personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial position.\n\u2022\nAcquisition of businesses. Part of our business strategy is to opportunistically acquire complementary businesses and dispose of non-complementary businesses, which involve risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks include:\n\u00b7 Loss of customers of the acquired businesses;\n\u00b7 Inability to integrate successfully the acquired businesses\u2019 operations;\n\u00b7 Inability to coordinate management and integrate and retain employees of the acquired businesses;\t\n\u00b7 Difficulties in implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;\n\u00b7 Failure to realize anticipated synergies, economies of scale or other anticipated benefits, or to maintain operating margins;\n\u00b7 Strain on our personnel, systems and resources, and diversion of attention from other priorities;\n\u00b7 Incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense;\n\u00b7 Unforeseen or contingent liabilities of the acquired businesses; and\n\u00b7 Large write-offs or write-downs, or the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets.\t\n\u2022 Regulatory environment. We cannot anticipate the impact of changes in laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations, and environmental laws, in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions. Increased legislative and regulatory activity and burdens, and a more stringent manner in which they are applied, could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole. For example, the Affordable Care Act (the \u201cACA\u201d), which was adopted in 2010 and is being phased in over several years, significantly affects the provision of both health care services and benefits in the United States; the ACA may impact our cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance and/or benefits, and may also impact various other aspects of our business. The ACA did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2014 or prior financial results; however, we are continuing to assess the impact of the ACA on our health care benefit costs. Further, financial services businesses of all kinds are subject to increasing regulation and enforcement. In addition to potentially increasing the costs of doing business due to compliance obligations, new laws and regulations, or changes to existing laws and regulations, as well as the enforcement thereof, may affect the relationships between creditors and debtors, inhibit the rights of creditors to collect amounts owed to them, expand liability for certain actions or inactions, or limit the types of financial products or services offered, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could also result in penalties and damage to our reputation, and/or the incurrence of remediation costs. These developments, and other potential future legislation and regulations, as well as the increasingly strict regulatory environment, may also adversely affect the customers to which, and the markets into which, we sell our products, and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen.\n\u2022 The threat of terrorism and related political instability and economic uncertainty. The threat of potential terrorist attacks on the United States and throughout the world and political instability has created an atmosphere of economic uncertainty in the United States and in foreign markets. Our results may be impacted by the macroeconomic effects of those events. Also, a disruption in our supply chain as a result of terrorist attacks or the threat thereof may significantly affect our business and its prospects. In addition, such events may also result in heightened domestic security and higher costs for importing and exporting shipments of components and finished goods. Any of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flow or results in any reporting period.\n\u2022 Information technology system failures and attacks could harm our business. Our business is dependent on the efficient functioning of our information technology systems and operations, which are vulnerable to damage or interruption from such factors as fires, natural disasters, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and worms, hacking, software defects, as well as human error. Despite our precautions, problems could result in interruptions in services and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022 Unforeseen events. We cannot anticipate the impact of unforeseen events, including but not limited to war and pandemic disease, on economic conditions and consumer confidence in our business.\nThe risk factors described above are not intended to be all-inclusive. There can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting our business or that the publicly available and other information with respect to these matters is complete and correct. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact us. Should any risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial position.", "PERMNO": 44230, "SIC": 3540, "TIC": "PFIN"}
