You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below before making a decision to buy our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or growth prospects could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and growth prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe may experience significant quarterly fluctuations in our operating results due to a number of factors, which make our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations.\nDue to our limited operating history, our evolving business model and the unpredictability of our emerging industry, certain of our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future. Many of the factors that cause these fluctuations are outside of our control. The amount we spend to acquire patent assets, the characteristics of the assets acquired and the timing of those acquisitions may result in significant quarterly fluctuations in our capital expenditures and our financial results, and the amount and timing of our membership sales may result in significant fluctuations in our cash flow on a quarterly basis. In addition, we do not believe that our rate of growth since inception is representative of anticipated future revenue growth, and we have experienced year-over-year declines in revenue in the most recent periods and may continue to experience year-over-year declines in the future. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.\nIn addition to the factors described above and elsewhere in this Item 1A, other factors that may affect our operating results include:\n\u2022\nchanges in our subscription fee rates or changes in our own pricing and discounting policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\ndecreases in our clients\u2019 and prospective clients\u2019 costs of litigating patent infringement claims;\n\u2022\nchanges in the accounting treatment associated with how we recognize revenue under subscription agreements;\n\u2022\nthe emergence of commercially successful new technology sectors with exposure to patents; the availability of patent portfolios that apply to these products and services; and the aggressiveness of NPEs and other licensors in monetizing their portfolios;\n\u2022\nour inability to effectively develop and implement new services that meet client requirements in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nthe addition or loss of discovery services clients and projects which are difficult to predict and may result in material changes in quarterly revenue and costs, and in particular a decrease in revenue during 2018;\n\u2022\nnon-renewals from existing clients for any reason;\n\u2022\nchanges in patent law and regulations and other legislation, as well as United States Patent and Trademark Office procedures or court rulings, that reduce the value of our services to our existing and potential clients;\n\u2022\nour expansion into new international markets;\n\u2022\nlower subscription fees from clients whose annual subscription fees decrease due to declining operating income or revenue of such clients, the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, or decreased NPE risk;\n\u2022\nchanges in the accounting treatment associated with our acquisitions of patent assets and how we amortize those patent assets;\n\u2022\nour inability to acquire patent assets that are being asserted or may be asserted against our clients due to lack of availability, unfavorable pricing terms or otherwise;\n\u2022\nour lengthy and unpredictable membership sales cycle, including delays in potential clients\u2019 decisions whether to subscribe to our patent risk management services;\n\u2022\nour acquisition of patent assets with a shorter estimated useful life that increases our near-term patent asset amortization expense and decreases our earnings;\n\u2022\nloss of clients, including through acquisitions or consolidations;\n\u2022\nlosses incurred as a result of claims made on insurance policies underwritten or assumed by us;\n\u2022\nour inability to retain key personnel;\n\u2022\nincreases in operating expenses, including those attributable to additional headcount, or the costs of new business initiatives, and our acquisition of Inventus;\n\u2022\nother matters related to our acquisition of Inventus and the expansion of our business into discovery services;\n\u2022\nany significant changes in the competitive dynamics of our markets, including new competitors or substantial discounting of services that are viewed by our target markets as competitive to ours;\n\u2022\nincreases in the prices we need to pay to acquire patent assets;\n\u2022\ngains or losses realized as a result of our sale of patents, including upon the exercise by any of our clients of their limited right to purchase certain of our patent assets for defensive purposes in the event of a patent infringement suit brought against such client by a third party; and\n\u2022\nadverse economic conditions in the industries that we serve, particularly as they affect the intellectual property risk management and/or litigation budgets of our existing or potential clients.\nIf our operating results in a particular quarter do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could be substantially affected. In particular, if our operating results fall below expectations, our stock price could decline substantially.\nThe market for our patent risk management services is evolving, and if these services are not widely accepted or if demand for these services is not sustained, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nWe have derived substantially all of our revenue from the sale of memberships to our patent risk management services and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. As a result, widespread acceptance of these services is critical to our future success. The market for patent risk management services is evolving and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. Our success will depend, to a substantial extent, on the willingness of companies of all sizes to purchase and renew memberships as a way to reduce their patent litigation costs. If companies do not perceive the cost-savings benefits of patent risk management services, then wide market adoption of our patent risk management services will not develop, or it may develop more slowly than we expect. Either scenario would adversely affect our operating results in a significant way. Factors that may negatively affect wide market acceptance of these services, as well as our ability to obtain new clients and renew existing clients, include:\n\u2022\nreduced assertions from non-practicing entities (\"NPEs\") or decreased patent licensing fees owed to NPEs;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of NPEs to bring patent claims or limitations on the potential damages recoverable from such claims;\n\u2022\nreduced cost to our clients of defending patent assertion claims;\n\u2022\nuncertainty about our ability to significantly reduce patent litigation costs for a particular company;\n\u2022\nlack of perceived relevance and value in our existing patent asset portfolio by existing or potential clients;\n\u2022\nconcerns by existing or potential clients about our future ability to obtain rights to patent assets that are being or may be asserted against them;\n\u2022\nreduced incentives to renew memberships if clients have vested into perpetual licenses in all patent assets that they believe are materially relevant to their businesses;\n\u2022\nlack of sufficient interest by mid- and small-size companies in our patent risk management or insurance offerings;\n\u2022\nlack of expansion of technology and patent risk to markets that previously have not incorporated, but are currently incorporating, technology into businesses;\n\u2022\nreduced incentive for companies to become clients because we do not assert our patent assets in litigation;\n\u2022\nconcerns that we might change our current business model and assert our patent assets in litigation;\n\u2022\nbudgetary limitations for existing or potential clients; and\n\u2022\nthe belief that adequate coverage for the risks and expenses we attempt to reduce is available from alternative products or services.\nThe success of our business depends on clients renewing their patent risk subscription agreements, and we do not have an adequate operating history to predict the rate of membership renewals. Any significant decline in our membership renewals could harm our operating results.\nOur patent risk services clients have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after the expiration of their initial membership period. We have limited historical data with respect to rates of subscription renewals, so we cannot\naccurately predict renewal rates. As of December 31, 2017, the weighted-average term of our subscription agreements with our current clients since the inception of those agreements was 2.3 years. As our overall membership base grows, we expect our rate of client renewals to decline compared to our historical rate. Our clients may choose not to renew their memberships or, if they do renew, may choose to do so for shorter terms or seek a reduced subscription fee. Many of our subscription agreements provide for one-year renewal periods. As a result, as more of our clients are in renewal periods, the weighted-average term of our subscription agreements has decreased and may continue to decrease further. If our clients do not renew their subscriptions or renew for shorter terms or if we allow them to renew at reduced subscription fees, our revenue may decline and our business may be adversely affected.\nUpon initial subscription, our clients receive a term license for the period of their membership to substantially all of the patent assets in our portfolio at the time of subscription. In addition, clients receive term licenses to substantially all of the patent assets we acquire during the period of their membership. Our subscription agreements also typically include a vesting provision that converts a client\u2019s term licenses into perpetual licenses on a delayed, rolling basis as long as the company remains a client. Accordingly, clients who continue to subscribe to our services receive perpetual licenses to an increasing number of our patent assets over time. If we are unable to adequately show clients that we are continuing to obtain additional patent assets that are being or may be asserted against them, clients may choose not to renew their subscriptions once they have vested into a perpetual license to all patent assets they believe are materially relevant to their businesses.\nIf we are unable to enhance our current services or to develop or acquire new services to provide additional value to our clients and potential clients, our business may be harmed.\nIn order to attract new clients and retain existing clients, we need to enhance and improve our existing service offering and introduce new services that meet the needs of our clients. We have in the past, and may in the future, seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our services, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities.\nThe development and implementation of new services will continue to require substantial time and resources, as well as require us to operate businesses that would be new to our organization. These or any other new services may not be introduced in a timely manner or at all. If we do introduce these or any other services, we may be unable to implement such services in a cost-effective manner, achieve wide market acceptance, meet client expectations or generate revenue sufficient to recoup the cost of developing such services. Any new services we introduce may expose us to additional laws, regulations and risks. If we are unable to develop these or other services successfully and enhance our existing services to meet client requirements or expectations, we may not be able to attract or retain clients, and our business may be harmed.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects, and potential clients may have concerns regarding the effectiveness of our business model in the future. If companies do not continue to subscribe to our services, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nWe acquired our first patent assets in September 2008, sold our first membership in October 2008, and sold our first insurance policy in August 2012. In addition, we acquired Inventus and its legal discovery services business in January 2016. The legal discovery services business is a relatively new business for us. Therefore, we have not only a limited operating history, but also a limited track record in executing our business model. Our future success depends on acceptance of our services by companies we target to become clients. Our efforts to sell our products to new and existing clients may not continue to be successful. We evaluate our business model from time to time in order to address the evolving needs of our clients and prospective clients, particularly in an industry that continues to develop and change. Our limited operating history may also make it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies in rapidly changing industries. If we do not manage these risks successfully, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nIf the market for our services is not sustained, or if competitors introduce new solutions that compete with our services, we may be unable to renew our memberships, sell insurance policies or attract new clients at favorable prices based on the same pricing model we have historically used. In the future, it is possible that competitive dynamics in our market may require us to change our pricing model, reduce our subscription fee rates, or consider adding new pricing programs or discounts, which would likely harm our operating results. In order to attract new clients and retain existing clients, in certain cases we have previously offered, and may in the future offer, discounts or other contractual incentives to clients.\nOur subscription fees from clients may decrease due to factors outside of our control. Any reduction in subscription fees could harm our business and operating results.\nSubscription fees are typically reset annually based on a client\u2019s reported revenue and operating income measured as of the end of its last fiscal year or reflect a fixed fee that is risk-adjusted for the client's patent risk profile. If a client pays a subscription fee based on our rate card and is not already paying the minimum due under that rate card experiences reduced operating results, its subscription fee for the next year will decline. As a result, our revenue stream may be affected by conditions outside of our control that impact the operating results of our clients.\nOur rate cards generally provide that our subscription fee as a percentage of the client\u2019s operating income decreases as their operating income goes up. In addition, many of our clients\u2019 rate cards are subject to an annual cap. As a result, if one of our clients acquires another client, our future revenue could be reduced as a result of the application of our rate card to the combined entity rather than to each entity separately. Any reduction in subscription fees could harm our business and operating results.\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\") will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and may increase the variability of the revenue recognized from our patent risk management fees from period to period and may reduce the amount of revenue we recognize.\nThrough December 31, 2017, we recognized revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (\u201cASC 605\u201d) and related authoritative guidance. Effective January 1, 2018, we began recognizing revenue in accordance with ASC 606, which is explained further under the heading \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, \"Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report. Our patent risk management revenue will be materially impacted by the adoption of this new standard due to the identification of multiple performance obligations from our patent risk management membership subscription and the timing and amount of recognition for these separable performance obligations. Specifically, we recognize separate performance obligations under the new standard for certain discrete patent assets transferred to our membership clients (referred to as a \"catalyst license\") as well as for access to the patent portfolio clients obtain when becoming a member or renewing membership (referred to as a \"portfolio access license\"). The revenue generated from these additional performance obligations will be recognized at a point in time under ASC 606 as licensing revenue whereas under ASC 605, we generally recognized these membership fees ratably over the term of the customer contract as subscription revenue. Additionally, we will determine whether revenue should be treated on a gross or net basis for these additional separable performance obligations which may result in revenue which is treated on a gross basis under ASC 605 to be treated on a net basis under ASC 606 which reduces our basis in our patent assets. Therefore, the adoption of ASC 606 will increase the variability of revenue recognized from our patent risk management services from period to period as well as reduce revenue and patent assets previously treated on a gross basis under ASC 605 that will be treated on a net basis under ASC 606.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of clients, and if we are not able to obtain membership renewals or continued engagements from these clients, our revenue may decrease substantially.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of clients. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2017, our 10 highest revenue-generating clients accounted for approximately 30% of our total revenue. We expect that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to come from a relatively small number of clients for the foreseeable future. If any of these clients chooses not to remain a client, or if our fees from one of these clients decline, our revenue may correspondingly decrease and our operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur membership sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our membership sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our membership sales are difficult to predict and will vary substantially from quarter to quarter, which may cause our cash flow to fluctuate significantly.\nBecause we operate in a relatively new and unproven market, our membership sales efforts involve educating potential clients about the benefit of our services, including potential cost savings to a company. Potential clients typically undergo a lengthy decision-making process that has, in the past, generally resulted in a lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle. Mid- and small-size companies are generally subject to less patent litigation and we expect even lengthier sales cycles for such companies. We spend substantial time, effort and resources in our membership sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any membership sales. In addition, subscriptions are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. As a result of these factors, our membership sales in any period are difficult to predict and will likely vary substantially between periods, which may cause our cash flow to fluctuate significantly between periods.\nWe recently announced a process to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, which may result in the use of a significant amount of our management resources or significant costs, and we may not be able to achieve any particular outcome or to fully realize the potential benefit of such alternatives.\nIn February 2018, we announced that the Board of Directors is conducting a process to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. The Board has not made any decisions related to any strategic alternatives at this time. No assurances can be made with regard to the timeline for completion of the strategic review, or whether the review will result in any particular outcome. This process may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses, whether or not any particular outcome is achieved.\nWe acquired Inventus in January 2016, and may acquire or invest in other companies or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results. We may also be unable to realize the expected benefits and synergies of any acquisitions.\nWe have in the past and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our services, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations, and technologies successfully or effectively manage the combined business. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.\nIn addition, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the Inventus or another acquisition due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel;\n\u2022\nthe need to integrate the operations, systems (including accounting, management, information, human resources and other administrative systems), technologies, products, and personnel of each acquired company, which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process;\n\u2022\nthe need to implement or improve controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that prior to our acquisition may have lacked such controls, procedures, and policies or whose controls, procedures, and policies did not meet applicable legal and other standards;\n\u2022\nour dependence on the accounting, financial reporting, operating metrics and similar systems, controls and processes of an acquired business, and the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems, controls, and processes will lead to errors in our consolidated financial statements or make it more difficult to manage the acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key customers, vendors, and other business partners of the companies we acquire following the announcement of our transaction plans;\n\u2022\nthe inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if such integration is delayed or not implemented, and unforeseen difficulties and expenditures that may arise as a result;\n\u2022\nderivative lawsuits resulting from the acquisition;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with our expansion into new international markets;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022\nincurrence of acquisition-related costs;\n\u2022\nincurrence of acquisition-related charges; for example, in connection with the preparation of our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an impairment loss of $89.0 million relating to our discovery services goodwill;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees;\n\u2022\nadditional legal, financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning and cash management;\n\u2022\nuse of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and\n\u2022\nuse of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.\nFuture acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial condition may suffer.\nIf the Inventus security measures are breached, our discovery services may be perceived as not being secure, clients may curtail or stop using our discovery services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.\nWe process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including personal information, for our discovery services clients, and a material security breach would expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, and potential liability. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nOur discovery services engagement agreements, including those related to our largest clients, can be terminated by our clients with little or no notice and without penalty, which may cause our operating results to be unpredictable.\nOur discovery services clients typically retain us on an engagement-by-engagement basis, rather than under fixed-term contracts; the volume of work performed for any particular client is likely to vary from month to month and year to year, and a major client in one fiscal period may not require or may decide not to use our services in any subsequent fiscal period. Almost all of our discovery services engagement agreements can be terminated by our clients with little or no notice and without penalty. For example, in engagements related to litigation, if the litigation were to be settled, our engagement for those services would no longer be necessary and, therefore, would be terminated. When discovery services engagements are terminated or reduced, we lose the associated future revenues, and we may not be able to recover associated costs or redeploy the affected employees in a timely manner to minimize the negative impact. In addition, our discovery services clients\u2019 ability to terminate engagements with little or no notice and without penalty makes it difficult to predict our operating results for the discovery services segment in any particular fiscal period.\nWe are dependent on our management team, and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan, which could harm our future growth and operating results.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers or other key management personnel that require them to remain our employees. Therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty. In 2017, a number of our key executive officers left RPX, including our previous chief executive officer, our previous executive vice president, our previous chief financial officer who had subsequently served in another executive role, the previous chief executive officer of Inventus, and our previous chief revenue officer. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of one or more of our key employees, including the recent loss of our previous chief executive officer and our other executive officers, and the resulting turnover in our executive management team could seriously harm our business.\nBecause we generally recognized revenue from membership subscriptions over the term of the membership under ASC 605 through December 31, 2017, upturns or downturns in membership sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. As a result, our future operating results may be difficult to predict.\nThrough December 31, 2017, under ASC 605, we generally recognized subscription fees received from clients ratably over the period of time to which those fees applied. Most of our clients are invoiced annually, and thus their fees were recognized as revenue over the course of 12 months under ASC 605. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in that quarter\u2019s revenue and will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure quickly to reflect this reduced revenue. Accordingly, the effect of either significant downturns in membership sales or rapid market acceptance of our services may not be fully reflected in our results of operations in the period in which such events occur. Our membership subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as subscription fees from new clients must generally be recognized over the applicable membership term. Effective January 1, 2018, we began recognizing subscription fees under ASC 606 which significantly impacts the timing of revenue recognized as compared to ASC 605 as discussed above.\nOur inability to identify, attract, train, integrate and retain highly qualified employees would harm our business.\nOur future success depends on our ability to identify, attract, train, integrate and retain highly qualified technical, sales and marketing, managerial and administrative personnel. In particular, our ability to increase our revenue is dependent on our ability to hire personnel who can identify and acquire valuable patent assets and attract new clients. Competition for highly skilled sales, business development and technical individuals is intense, and we continue to face difficulty identifying and hiring qualified personnel in some areas of our business. We may not be able to hire and retain such personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Many of the\ncompanies with which we compete for hiring experienced employees have greater resources than we have. If we fail to identify, attract, train, integrate and retain highly qualified and motivated personnel, our reputation could suffer, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable either to identify patent assets that are being asserted or that could be asserted against existing and potential clients or to obtain such assets at prices that are economically supportable within our business model, we may not be able to attract or retain sufficient clients and our operating results would be harmed.\nOur ability to attract new clients and renew the subscription agreements of existing clients depends on our ability to identify and acquire patent assets that are being asserted or that could be asserted against our existing or potential clients. There is no guarantee that we will be able to adequately identify those types of patent assets on an ongoing basis and, even if identified, that we will be able to acquire rights to those patent assets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. As new technological advances occur, some or all of the patent assets we have acquired may become less valuable or obsolete before we have had the opportunity to obtain significant value from those assets.\nOur approach to acquiring patent assets generally involves acquiring ownership or a license at a fixed price. Other companies, such as NPEs, often offer contingent payments to sellers of patents that may provide the seller the opportunity to receive greater amounts in the future for the sale of its patents as compared to the fixed price we generally pay. As a result, we may not be able to compete effectively for the acquisition of certain patent assets.\nIf clients do not perceive that the patent assets we acquire are relevant to their businesses, we will have difficulty attracting new clients and retaining existing clients, and our operating results will be harmed. Similarly, if clients are not satisfied with the amount of capital we deploy to acquire patent assets, they may choose not to renew their subscriptions. These risks are greater if we elect to invest a significant amount of our capital in only a few acquisitions of patent assets.\nWe rely on various actuarial models in pricing our insurance product and estimating the frequency and severity of related loss events, but actual results could differ materially from the model outputs. Incurring losses that exceed our predictions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe employ various predictive modeling, stochastic modeling and/or actuarial techniques to analyze and estimate losses and the risks associated with insurance policies that we underwrite or reinsure. We use the modeled outputs and related analyses to assist us in making underwriting, pricing and reinsurance decisions. The modeled outputs and related analyses are subject to numerous assumptions, uncertainties and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis. Consequently, modeled results may differ materially from our actual experience. If, based upon these models or otherwise, we under price our products or underestimate the frequency and/or severity of loss events, our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If, based upon these models or otherwise, we over price our products or overestimate the risks we are exposed to, new business growth and retention of our existing business may be adversely affected.\nWe have invested management time and resources into developing products designed to provide insurance against patent infringement claims. We have limited prior experience in designing or providing insurance products. If we are not successful in selling a significant amount of these insurance products, we will not realize the anticipated benefit of these investments, which could have an adverse effect on our growth prospects, and our business may be harmed.\nWe have invested management time and financial resources in the development of products designed to provide insurance against some of the costs resulting from patent claims. We are providing capital to develop and operate this business. We have limited prior experience in designing insurance products, operating an insurance business, attracting policyholders or establishing the pricing or terms of insurance policies and selling insurance policies in combination with membership subscriptions. We cannot assure you that our patent insurance products will appeal to a sufficient number of our existing clients or attract enough new clients to build a sustainable insurance business. If we are unsuccessful in managing this business, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our investments of capital and management attention, which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance and growth prospects and our business may be harmed.\nNew legislation, regulations or court rulings related to enforcing patents could reduce the value of our services to clients or potential clients and harm our business and operating results.\nIf Congress, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or courts implement additional legislation, regulations or rulings that impact the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, these changes could negatively affect the operating results and business model for NPEs. This, in turn, could reduce the value of our services to our current and potential clients. For example, limitations on the ability to bring patent enforcement claims, limitations on potential liability\nfor patent infringement, lower evidentiary standards for invalidating patents, reductions in the cost to resolve patent disputes and other similar developments could negatively affect an NPE\u2019s ability to assert its patent rights successfully, decrease the revenue associated with asserting or licensing an NPE\u2019s patent rights and increase the cost or risk of bringing patent enforcement actions. As a result, assertions and the threat of assertions by NPEs may decrease. If this occurs, companies may seek to resolve patent claims on an individual basis and be less willing to subscribe to our services or renew their memberships. Furthermore, even if companies are interested in subscribing to our services or maintaining their memberships, companies may be unwilling to pay the subscription fees that we propose. Any of these events could result in a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIn addition, future laws and regulations, or judicial interpretations thereof, could affect our discovery services clients and thus indirectly adversely affect our business. For example, changes to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure regarding discovery of \"electronically stored information\" could result in a decreased need for discovery services. Any of these events could result in a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nReleases of new software products or upgrades to our existing software products or licensed third-party software may have undetected errors, or may not operate as intended or achieve our client's desired objectives, which could cause litigation claims against us, damage to our reputation, or loss of business.\nCertain of our discovery services utilize software developed by us or third parties for the needs of our clients. Complex software products, such as those we utilize, can contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released, or may fail to operate as intended or achieve the client\u2019s desired objectives. Any introduction of new software products or upgrade to existing software products has a risk of undetected errors. These undetected errors may be discovered only after a product has been installed and used either in our internal processing or by our clients. Likewise, the software products we acquire in business acquisitions have a risk of undetected errors. Any undetected errors, difficulties in installing and maintaining our software products or upgrade releases, or the failure to achieve the client's desired objectives, may result in a delay or loss of revenue, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation, the loss of that client, loss of future business, increased service costs, potential litigation claims against us, or impaired market acceptance of our products.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively against others in our patent risk management or legal discovery services businesses. Any failure to compete effectively could harm our business and results of operations.\nIn our efforts to attract new clients and retain existing clients, we compete primarily against established patent risk management strategies employed by those companies. Companies can choose from a variety of other strategies to attempt to manage their patent risk, including internal buying or licensing programs, cross-licensing arrangements, patent-buying consortiums or other patent-buying pools and engaging legal counsel to defend against patent assertions. As a result, we spend considerable resources educating our existing and prospective clients on the potential benefits of our services and the value and cost savings they provide.\nIn addition to competing for new clients, we also compete to acquire patent assets. Our primary competitors in the market for patent assets are varied and include other entities that seek to accumulate patent assets, including NPEs such as Wi-LAN, Allied Security Trust, and PanOptis. In addition, many NPEs that compete with us to acquire patent assets have complicated corporate structures that include a large number of subsidiaries, so it is difficult for us to know how much capital the related entities have available to acquire patent assets. We also face competition for patent assets from operating companies, including operating companies that are current or prospective clients. Many of these operating companies have significantly greater financial resources than we have and can acquire patent assets at prices that we may not be able to pay.\nIn addition, the discovery services market is highly fragmented, extremely competitive, and continually changing as technology and the legal and regulatory environments evolve around the world. Our competitors include larger businesses that offer a distinct discovery service offering such as Epiq, KLDiscovery, Consilio, and FTI Consulting. We also compete with smaller regional discovery services businesses as well as discovery services practices inside large and mid-sized law firms and professional services firms. Many of our competitors in this market have a greater national and international presence, as well as have a significantly greater number of personnel, financial, technical, and marketing resources. In addition, these competitors may generate greater revenues and have greater name recognition than we do.\nWe expect to face more direct competition in the future in both our patent risk management business and legal discovery services business from other established and emerging companies. In addition, as a relatively new company in the patent risk management market and legal discovery services market, we have limited insight into trends that may develop and affect our businesses. As a result, we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, making us unable to compete effectively against others.\nOur current or potential competitors in both our patent risk management business and legal discovery services businesses vary widely in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and a larger client base and sales and marketing teams. The competition we face now and in the future could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and a failure to increase, or the loss of, market share. We may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against our current or future competitors, and our failure to do so could seriously harm our business.\nCertain of our acquisitions of patent assets are time consuming, complex and costly, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nCertain of our acquisitions of patent assets are time consuming, complex and costly to consummate. We utilize many different transaction structures in our acquisitions and the terms of the acquisition agreements tend to be very heavily negotiated. As a result, we may incur significant operating expenses during the negotiations even when the acquisition is ultimately not consummated. Even if we successfully acquire particular patent assets, there is no guarantee that we will generate sufficient revenue related to those patent assets to offset the acquisition costs. While we conduct confirmatory due diligence on the patent assets we are considering for acquisition, we may acquire patent assets from a seller who does not have proper title to those assets. In those cases, we may be required to spend significant resources to defend our interests in the patent assets and, if we are not successful, our acquisition may be invalid, in which case we could lose part or all of our investment in the assets.\nWe occasionally identify patent assets that cost more than we are prepared to spend of our own capital resources or that may be relevant only to a very small number of clients. In these circumstances, we may structure and coordinate a transaction in which certain of our clients contribute funds that are in addition to their subscription fees in order to acquire those patent assets. These syndicated acquisitions are complex and can be large and highly visible. We may incur significant costs to organize and negotiate a syndicated acquisition that does not ultimately result in an acquisition of any patent assets. These higher costs could adversely affect our operating results. Our roles in structuring the acquisition and managing the acquisition entity, if one is used, may expose us to financial and reputational risks.\nIf we are not perceived as a trusted patent risk manager, our ability to maintain wide market acceptance will be harmed, and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur reputation, which depends on earning and maintaining the trust of existing and potential clients, is critical to our business. Our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or impossible to remediate. For our business to be successful, we must continue to educate potential clients about our role as a trusted intermediary in the patent market. If our reputation is harmed, we may have more difficulty attracting new clients and retaining existing clients, and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe unavailability of third-party technology could adversely impact our revenue and results of operations.\nWe license certain discovery-related software from third parties and incorporate such software into our discovery services. Most of our third-party software license contracts expire within one year and may be renewed only by mutual consent. There is no assurance that we will be able to renew these contracts as they expire or that such renewals will be on the same or substantially similar terms or on conditions that are commercially reasonable to us. If we fail to renew these contracts as they expire, our discovery services offerings may be reduced. In addition, our third-party software licenses are non-exclusive, and therefore, our competitors may obtain the right to license certain of the technology covered by these agreements to compete directly with us. In certain situations, our third party software licensors are themselves also our competitors in the discovery services market.\nIf certain of our third-party licensors were to change product offerings, cease actively supporting the technologies, fail to update and enhance the technologies to keep pace with changing industry standards, encounter technical difficulties in the continuing development of these technologies, significantly increase prices, terminate our licenses, suffer significant capacity or supply chain constraints or suffer significant disruptions, we would need to seek alternative suppliers and incur additional internal or external development costs to ensure continued performance of our discovery services. Such alternatives may not be available on attractive terms, or may not be as widely accepted or as effective as the current licenses provided by our existing suppliers. If the cost of licensing or maintaining the third party intellectual property significantly increases, our operating earnings could significantly decrease. In addition, interruption in functionality of our services and products as a result of changes in or with third party licensors could adversely affect our commitments to clients, future sales, and negatively affect our revenue and operating earnings.\nInterruptions or delays in service at the data centers we utilize for discovery services could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business.\nWe provide services through computer hardware that is located in co-location data centers operated by unrelated third parties. Although we do own that computer hardware, we do not control the operation of these colocation facilities, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. The data centers are subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures and similar events. These facilities are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. The occurrence of any of these events or other unanticipated problems at a facility could result in interruptions in certain of our services, although we have established backup recovery data centers to try to minimize this risk. In addition, the failure by our vendor to provide our required data communications capacity could result in poor service or interruptions in our service. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems or services could reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause clients to terminate their agreements with us and adversely affect our ability to secure business in the future. Our business will be harmed if our clients and potential clients believe our services are unreliable.\nIf the value of our goodwill or intangible assets become materially impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe test goodwill for impairment at least annually. If such goodwill is deemed to be impaired, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined, which would negatively affect our results of operations. For example, in connection with the preparation of our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017, we concluded that impairment losses of $94.1 million would be recorded in the financial information of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, $89.0 million of which relates to goodwill in our discovery services segment and the remaining impairment is associated with our cost method investments in our patent risk management segment.\nOur business model requires estimates and judgments by our management. Our estimates and judgments are subject to changes that could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur patent risk management business model is relatively new and therefore our accounting and tax treatment has limited precedent. The determination of patent asset amortization expense for financial and income tax reporting requires estimates and judgments on the part of management. Some of our patent asset acquisitions are complex, requiring additional estimates and judgments on the part of our management. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and judgments; however, such estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and factors may arise that lead us to change our estimates or judgments. If this or any other changes occur, our operating results may be adversely affected. Furthermore, if the accounting or tax treatment is challenged, we may be required to spend considerable time and expense defending our position and we may be unable to successfully defend our accounting or tax treatment, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf we fail to manage the risks associated with operating an insurance business, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIn August 2012, we began to offer insurance products for patent claims, and therefore face risks associated with the operation of an insurance business. There are many estimates and forecasts involved in predicting underwriting and reinsurance risk and setting premiums, many of which are subject to substantial uncertainty and which could cause our expenses and earnings to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. If we do not estimate our underwriting and reinsurance risks and set our premiums successfully, we may incur larger losses on our policies than we expect, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, while premiums earned from our insurance policies are recognized ratably, losses are recognized as incurred. This will increase the variability of our operating results until such time as our insurance business operates at scale. Furthermore, the insurance market is highly regulated, so operation of an insurance business exposes us to additional laws and regulations. Compliance with such laws and regulations may be costly, which could affect our results of operations.\nWe may become involved in patent or other litigation proceedings related to our clients. Our involvement could cause us to expend significant resources. It could also require us to disclose information related to our clients, which could cause such clients not to renew their subscriptions with us.\nThe patent market is heavily impacted by litigation. As a result, we may be required, by subpoena or otherwise, to participate in patent or other litigation proceedings related to our clients. Our participation in any such proceedings could require us to expend significant resources and could also be perceived as adverse to the interests of our clients or potential clients if we are required to disclose any information about our clients that we have gathered in the course of\ntheir memberships. These additional expenditures and potential disclosures could make it more difficult for us to attract new clients and retain existing clients, and our results of operations could be harmed. We may incur significant costs in defending claims made against us and the result may not be favorable. An unfavorable outcome of any claim could result in proliferation of similar claims against us. The expense and disclosure associated with our involvement in litigation could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nInterpretations of current laws and the passage of future laws could harm our business and operating results.\nBecause of our presence in an emerging industry, the application to us of existing United States and foreign laws is unclear. Many laws do not contemplate or address the specific issues associated with our patent risk management services or other products and services we may provide in the future. It is possible that courts or other governmental authorities will interpret existing laws regulating risk management and insurance, competition and antitrust practices, taxation, the practice of law and patent usage and transfers in a manner that is inconsistent with our business practices. Our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed if our operations are found to be in violation of any existing laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us. Additionally, existing laws and regulations may restrict our ability to deliver services to our clients, limit our ability to grow and cause us to incur significant expenses in order to comply with such laws and regulations. Even if our business practices are ultimately not affected, we may incur significant cost to defend our actions, incur negative publicity and suffer substantial diversion of management time and effort. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we face risks from laws that could be passed or changed in the future, including in the United Kingdom as a result of Brexit. Since a significant portion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially affect the regulatory regime in the United Kingdom. Changes in laws and regulations regarding data protection, privacy, network security, or encryption may affect our discovery services. It is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, or whether any of the proposals will become law. Compliance with any new or existing laws or regulations could be difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure to maintain or protect our patent assets or other intellectual property rights could impair our ability to attract or retain clients and could harm our business and operating results.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to acquire patent assets that are valuable to our existing and potential clients. Following the acquisition of patent assets, we expend significant time and resources to maintain the effectiveness of those assets by paying maintenance fees and making filings with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In some cases, the patent assets we acquire include patent applications which require us to invest resources to prosecute the applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. If we fail to maintain or prosecute our patent assets properly, the value of those assets to our clients would be reduced or eliminated, and our business may be harmed.\nIf we fail to develop widespread brand awareness cost-effectively, we may not attract new clients and our business and operating results may suffer.\nWe believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our services and is an important element in attracting new clients. Furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market develops. Brand promotion activities may not generate client awareness or yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand successfully, or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract or retain clients to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements could be impaired, which could adversely affect our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors\u2019 views of us.\nEnsuring that we have internal financial and accounting controls and procedures adequate to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. We have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, areas of our internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that need improvement. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting,\nas required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues. While neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm have identified deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, there can be no assurance that material weaknesses will not subsequently be identified. If we are unable to effectively remediate control deficiencies which are identified or are otherwise unable to maintain adequate internal controls over our financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to prepare reliable financial statements and comply with our reporting obligations on a timely basis, which could materially adversely affect our business and subject us to legal and regulatory action.\nGlobal economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our services or fees payable under our subscription agreements, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. In particular, the economics of countries in Europe have been experiencing weakness associated with high sovereign debt levels, weakness in the banking sector, and uncertainty over the future of the Euro zone, including instability surrounding Brexit. Uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and declines in income or asset values. This response could have a material negative effect on the demand for our services. Furthermore, if our clients experience reduced operating income or revenues as a result of economic conditions or otherwise, it would reduce their subscription fees because those fees are generally reset annually based on the clients\u2019 operating income or revenue. If the subscription fees payable under our subscription agreements are reduced substantially, it would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased, and will likely continue to increase, our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters, higher administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention. Further, if our compliance efforts differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed. Being a public company that is subject to these rules and regulations also makes it more expensive for us to obtain and retain director and officer liability insurance, and we may in the future be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain or retain adequate coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors and qualified executive officers.\nIf our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to customer data is otherwise obtained, our business may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our services and we may incur significant liabilities.\nOur business involves the storage and transmission of our and our customers\u2019 sensitive proprietary information. As a result, unauthorized access or security breaches could result in the loss of information, litigation, indemnity obligations and other liability. While we have security measures in place that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, if these measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and someone obtains unauthorized access to our data or our our customers\u2019 data, we could face loss of business, regulatory investigations or orders, our reputation could be severely damaged, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to alleviate the problem, as well as incur significant costs and liabilities, including due to litigation, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, and costs for remediation and other incentives offered to customers or other business partners in an effort to maintain business relationships after a breach.\nWe cannot assure you that any limitations of liability provisions in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security lapse or breach. We also cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims related to a security breach, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed\navailable insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.\nCyber-attacks and other malicious Internet-based activities continue to increase generally. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information to gain access to our data or our customers\u2019 data. If any of these events occur, our or our customers\u2019 information could be accessed or disclosed improperly. Any or all of these issues could negatively affect our ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to elect to not renew their subscriptions, result in reputational damage or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nPrivacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our business and adversely affect our business.\nOur business, particularly our discovery services business, may involve the collection, use and storage of certain types of personal or identifying information regarding our customers, their employees and partners. Federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted, are considering adopting or may adopt laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals, such as compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the recently created EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our business and reduce overall demand or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance with such privacy laws. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit adoption of our business in certain industries.\nAll of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to process, handle, store, use and transmit demographic and personal information from their employees, customers and partners, which could reduce demand for our business. The European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and many countries in Europe have stringent privacy laws and regulations, which may affect our ability to operate cost effectively in certain European countries. In particular, the EU has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) which will go into effect in early 2018 and contains numerous requirements and changes, including more robust obligations on data processors and heavier documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs by companies. Complying with the GDPR may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to change our business practices. Despite our efforts to bring practices into compliance before the effective date of the GDPR, we may not be successful either due to internal or external factors such as resource allocation limitations or a lack of vendor cooperation. Non-compliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. We may also experience difficulty retaining or obtaining new European or multi-national customers due to the compliance cost, potential risk exposure, and uncertainty for these entities.\nSales to customers outside the United States or with international operations expose us to risks inherent in international sales.\nA key element of our growth strategy is to expand our international operations and develop a worldwide customer base. The combined revenues from non-U.S. regions, based on the country in which the client is domiciled, constituted 41%, 42% and 36% of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks that are different from those in the United States. Because of our limited experience with international operations, our international expansion efforts may not be successful in creating additional demand for our services outside of the United States or in effectively selling our services in all of the international markets we enter. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to grow our combined revenues from non-U.S. regions as a percentage of our total revenues. In addition, we will face risks in doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u2022\nthe need to localize and adapt our services for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u2022\ndata privacy laws that require customer data to be stored and processed in a designated territory;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and working with foreign partners;\n\u2022\ndifferent pricing environments, longer sales cycles and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;\n\u2022\nnew and different sources of competition;\n\u2022\nweaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u2022\ncompliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could increase the price of our services outside of the United States, increase the expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022\nunstable regional and economic political conditions.\nAs we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international sales and operations. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully, or to comply with these laws and regulations, could harm our operations, reduce our sales and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe might require additional capital to support our business growth and future patent asset acquisitions, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to acquire patent assets, develop new services or enhance our existing service offering, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit agreements to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies.\nThe methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations, including the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, patent assets, other investments, income taxes, litigation and other intangibles, and other contingencies. Such methods, estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods, estimates and judgments. In addition, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Changes in those methods, estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to continue offering an \u201cA\u201d rated insurance product.\nIn May 2014, we began offering an \u201cA\u201d rated insurance product. If we are unable to maintain our relationship with one or more \u201cA\u201d rated insurance companies, we may be unable to continue offering an \u201cA\u201d rated insurance product, which could have an adverse effect on new insurance business growth and retention of our existing insurance business.\nOur operations are subject to risks of natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism or widespread illness at our domestic and international locations, any one of which could result in a business stoppage and negatively affect our operating results.\nOur business operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our facility, computer systems and personnel, which are primarily located in the San Francisco Bay Area. The San Francisco Bay Area is in close proximity to known earthquake fault zones. Our facility and transportation for our employees are susceptible to damage from earthquakes and other natural disasters such as fires, floods and similar events. Should earthquakes or other catastrophes such as fires, floods, power outages, communication failures or similar events disable our facilities, we do not have readily available alternative facilities from which we could conduct our business, which stoppage could have a negative effect on our operating results. Acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war could also have a negative effect at our international and domestic facilities and on our operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to be volatile in the future, and you might not be able to sell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased them.\nSince our initial public offering in May 2011, our stock price has traded as high as $31.41 per share and as low as $8.55 per share. Further, our common stock has a limited trading history and an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained in the future. The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include those discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and others such as:\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nchanges in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u2022\naddition or loss of significant clients;\n\u2022\nadoption or modification of laws, regulations, policies, procedures or programs applicable to our business, including those related to the enforcement of patent claims;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new products and services, acquisitions, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nfactors regarding the previously-announced process to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of members of our Board of Directors, management team or other key personnel;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in our industry;\n\u2022\nthe impact of macroeconomic, market, and political factors and trends, including in light of Brexit, and other recent political developments;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market or resulting from inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022\nany change in our quarterly dividend or stock repurchase program;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nthe opening or closing of our employee trading window.\nIn recent years, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the changes in the operating performance of the companies whose stock is experiencing those price and volume fluctuations. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nSubstantial future sales of shares by existing stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause our stock price to decline, even if our business is doing well.\nIf our existing stockholders, particularly our directors and executive officers, sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or are perceived by the public market as intending to sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nIn addition, shares that are subject to outstanding options or that may be granted in the future under our equity plans will be eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting agreements and Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act.\nIf any of these additional shares described are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nAs a public company, our stock price has been volatile, and securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility of their stock price. Any such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of particular companies\u2019 securities, securities class action litigation has been instituted against these companies. Our stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile. If instituted against us, securities litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and stock price.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified Board of Directors, as a result of which the successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election;\n\u2022\nrequire that directors only be removed from office for cause and only upon a majority stockholder vote;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our Board of Directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u2022\ndo not provide stockholders with the ability to cumulate their votes;\n\u2022\nrequire supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022\nrequire advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.\nOur stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nIn February 2015, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to $75.0 million. In March 2016 and May 2016, our Board of Directors further increased the amount authorized to repurchase by $25.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively, to an aggregate authorized amount of $150.0 million. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, an assessment by management and our Board of Directors of cash availability and other market conditions. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase its volatility. The existence of our stock repurchase program could also cause the price of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our common stock. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased such shares. Any failure to repurchase shares after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program's effectiveness.\nOur quarterly dividend is new and modest in amount, and consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will continue to depend primarily on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nOn October 30, 2017, we announced that we will pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, the first of which we paid on December 5, 2017, to shareholders of record on November 20, 2017. Previously, we had never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. Our quarterly dividend is new and modest in amount. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the primary way to realize any future gains on their investments. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.", "PERMNO": 12795, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "RPXC"}
