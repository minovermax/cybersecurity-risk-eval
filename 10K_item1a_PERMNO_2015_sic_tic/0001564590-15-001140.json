{"cik": "1048477", "company": "BIOMARIN PHARMACEUTICAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. We operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing industry that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Other risks and uncertainties, including those that we do not currently consider material, may impair our business. If any of the risks discussed below actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. This could cause the value of our securities to decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approval to commercially market and sell our drugs, or if approval is delayed, we will be unable to generate revenue from the sale of these products, our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished, and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased.\nWe must obtain and maintain regulatory approval to market and sell our drug products in the U.S. and in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. In the U.S., we must obtain FDA approval for each drug that we intend to commercialize. The FDA approval process is typically lengthy and expensive, and approval is never certain. Products distributed abroad are also subject to government regulation by international regulatory authorities. The approval process in the EU and other countries can also be lengthy and expensive and\nregulatory approval is also never certain. Naglazyme, Aldurazyme and Kuvan have received regulatory approval to be commercially marketed and sold in the U.S., the EU and other countries. Firdapse has received regulatory approval to be commercially marketed only in the EU. Vimizim received regulatory approval in the U.S. on February 14, 2014, in the EU on April 28, 2014, in Canada on July 7, 2014 and in Australia on December 2, 2014 but has not been approved in any other jurisdiction and may never receive additional regulatory approvals for any other jurisdiction.\nAs part of the recent reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, new biologics are included in a new product review program intended to enhance FDA-sponsor communications to lead to greater first-cycle approval decisions. As part of this program, applications for new biologics are subject to either a 12-month standard or 8-month priority review period that begins from the date of application submission. However, since this is a new product review program and few products have completed this new review process, the priority review period may take longer than eight months and the standard review period may take longer than 12 months. Similarly, although the EMA has an accelerated approval process, the timelines mandated by the regulations are subject to the possibility of substantial delays.\nIn addition, the FDA and its international equivalents have substantial discretion over the approval process for pharmaceutical products. As such, these regulatory agencies may in the end not agree that we have demonstrated the requisite level of product safety and efficacy to grant approval and may require additional data. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will be unable to market and sell those drug products. Because of the risks and uncertainties in pharmaceutical development, our product candidates could take a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than we expect or may never gain approval. We also rely on independent third-party contract research organizations (CROs) to file some of our ex-U.S. and ex-EU marketing applications and important aspects of the services performed for us by the CROs are out of our direct control. If we fail to adequately manage our CROs, if the CRO elects to prioritize work on our projects below other projects or if there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our CROs, the filing of our applications may be delayed.\nFrom time to time during the regulatory approval process for our products and our product candidates, we engage in discussions with the FDA and comparable international regulatory authorities regarding the regulatory requirements for our development programs. To the extent appropriate, we accommodate the requests of the regulatory authorities and, to date, we have generally been able to reach reasonable accommodations and resolutions regarding the underlying issues. However, we are often unable to determine the outcome of such deliberations until they are final. If we are unable to effectively and efficiently resolve and comply with the inquiries and requests of the FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory authorities, the approval of our product candidates may be delayed and their value may be reduced.\nAfter any of our products receive regulatory approval, they remain subject to ongoing regulation, which can impact, among other things product labeling, manufacturing practices, adverse event reporting, storage, expiration, distribution, advertising and promotion, record keeping and import and export. If we do not comply with the applicable regulations, the range of possible sanctions includes issuance of warning or untitled letters or adverse publicity, product recalls or seizures, fines, total or partial suspensions of production and/or distribution, suspension of marketing applications, and other enforcement actions, including injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution. The FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies can withdraw a product\u2019s approval under some circumstances, such as the failure to comply with regulatory requirements or unexpected safety issues. Further, the FDA often requires post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. The FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies may condition approval of our product candidates on the completion of such post-marketing clinical studies. These post-marketing studies may suggest that a product causes undesirable side effects or may present a risk to the patient. If data we collect from post-marketing studies suggest that one of our approved products may present a risk to safety, the government authorities could withdraw our product approval, suspend production or place other marketing restrictions on our products. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is delayed or withdrawn, the value of our company and our operating results will be adversely affected. Additionally, we will be unable to generate revenue from the sale of these products, our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased.\nIf we fail to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for some of our products, our competitors may sell products to treat the same conditions and our revenues will be reduced.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to develop some drugs that may be eligible for FDA and EU orphan drug designation. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the U.S. The company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for a given rare disease receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the stated condition for a period of seven years. Orphan drug exclusive marketing rights may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug. Similar regulations are available in the EU with a ten-year period of market exclusivity.\nBecause the extent and scope of patent protection for some of our drug products is limited, orphan drug designation is especially important for our products that are eligible for orphan drug designation. For eligible drugs, we plan to rely on the exclusivity period\nunder the Orphan Drug Act to maintain a competitive position. If we do not obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our drug products that do not have broad patent protection, our competitors may then sell the same drug to treat the same condition and our revenues will be reduced.\nEven though we have obtained orphan drug designation for certain of our products and product candidates and even if we obtain orphan drug designation for our future product candidates, due to the uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for any particular orphan indication, which means that we may not obtain orphan drug exclusivity and could also potentially be blocked from approval until the first product\u2019s orphan drug exclusivity period expires. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved and granted orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug, nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nWe may face competition from biological products approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway.\nOur Naglazyme, Aldurazyme and Vimizim products are regulated by the FDA as biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDC Act) and the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act). Biologics require the submission of a BLA and approval by the FDA prior to being marketed in the U.S. Historically, a biologic product approved under a BLA was not subject to the generic drug review and approval provisions of the FDC Act. However, the PPACA created a regulatory pathway under the PHS Act for the abbreviated approval for biological products that are demonstrated to be \u201cbiosimilar\u201d or \u201cinterchangeable\u201d with an FDA-approved biological product. In order to meet the standard of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product, and for a product that is administered more than once, that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product. Such biosimilars would reference biological products approved in the U.S. The law establishes a period of 12 years of data exclusivity for reference products, which protects the data in the original BLA by prohibiting sponsors of biosimilars from gaining FDA approval based in part on reference to data in the original BLA. Our products approved under BLAs, as well as products in development that may be approved under BLAs, could be reference products for such biosimilar marketing applications.\nTo obtain regulatory approval to market our products, preclinical studies and costly and lengthy preclinical and clinical trials are required and the results of the studies and trials are highly uncertain.\nAs part of the regulatory approval process we must conduct, at our own expense, preclinical studies in the laboratory and clinical trials on humans for each product candidate. We expect the number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that the regulatory authorities will require will vary depending on the product candidate, the disease or condition the drug is being developed to address and regulations applicable to the particular drug. Generally, the number and size of clinical trials required for approval increase based on the expected patient population that may be treated with a drug. We may need to perform multiple preclinical studies using various doses and formulations before we can begin clinical trials, which could result in delays in our ability to market any of our product candidates. Furthermore, even if we obtain favorable results in preclinical studies, the results in humans may be significantly different. After we have conducted preclinical studies, we must demonstrate that our drug products are safe and efficacious for use in the targeted human patients in order to receive regulatory approval for commercial sale. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials, and favorable data from interim analyses do not ensure the final results of a trial will be favorable. Product candidates may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials, or despite having favorable data in connection with an interim analysis. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Our future clinical trial results may not be successful.\nAdverse or inconclusive clinical results would stop us from filing for regulatory approval of our product candidates. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials include:\n\u00b7\nslow or insufficient patient enrollment;\n\u00b7\nslow recruitment of, and completion of necessary institutional approvals at, clinical sites;\n\u00b7\nlonger treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy;\n\u00b7\nlack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate;\n\u00b7\nadverse medical events or side effects in treated patients;\n\u00b7\nlack of effectiveness of the product candidate being tested; and\n\u00b7\nregulatory requests for additional clinical trials or pre-clinical studies.\nTypically, if a drug product is intended to treat a chronic disease, as is the case with some of our product candidates, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time, which can range from nine months to three years or more. We also rely on independent third-party CROs to perform most of our clinical studies and many important aspects of the services performed for us by the CROs are out of our direct control. If we fail to adequately manage our CROs, or if there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our CROs, our clinical trials may be delayed. Moreover, in our regulatory submissions, we rely on the quality and validity of the clinical work performed by third-party CROs. If any of our CROs\u2019 processes, methodologies or results were determined to be not conducted in accordance with current GCP, invalid or inadequate, our own clinical data and results and related regulatory approvals could adversely be impacted.\nIf we continue to incur operating losses for a period longer than anticipated, we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nSince we began operations in March 1997, we have been engaged in substantial research and development and operated at a net loss until 2008. Although we were profitable in 2008, 2010 and the third quarter of 2014, we operated at a net loss in 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Based upon our current plan for investments in research and development for existing and new programs, we expect to operate at a net loss for at least the next 12 months. Our future profitability depends on our marketing and selling of Vimizim, Naglazyme, Kuvan and Firdapse, the successful continued commercialization of Aldurazyme by Genzyme, the receipt of regulatory approval of our product candidates, our ability to successfully manufacture and market any approved drugs, either by ourselves or jointly with others, our spending on our development programs and the impact of any possible future business development transactions. The extent of our future losses and the timing of profitability are highly uncertain. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nIf we fail to comply with manufacturing regulations, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nBefore we can begin commercial manufacture of our products, regulatory authorities must approve marketing applications that identify manufacturing facilities operated by us or our contract manufacturers that have passed regulatory inspection and manufacturing processes that are acceptable to the regulatory authorities. In addition, our pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are continuously subject to inspection by the FDA and international regulatory authorities, before and after product approval. Our manufacturing facilities in the U.S. have been approved by the FDA, the EC, and health agencies in other countries for the manufacture of Aldurazyme and Naglazyme. In addition, our third-party manufacturers\u2019 facilities involved with the manufacture of Vimizim, Naglazyme, Kuvan, Aldurazyme and Firdapse have also been inspected and approved by various regulatory authorities. Although we are not involved in the day-to-day operations of our contract manufacturers, we are ultimately responsible for ensuring that our products are manufactured in accordance with cGMP regulations. The manufacturing facility located in Shanbally, Cork, Ireland that we purchased in 2011 has not yet been approved by the FDA or the EMA to manufacture any of our products. We intend to make a substantial investment in the build-out of the Shanbally facility in order to manufacture Vimizim and other products. If the facility is not ultimately approved by the FDA or the EMA to manufacture any of our products, we will not be able to manufacture Vimizim or other products at this facility and we may not be able to meet the anticipated commercial demand for Vimizim which would have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nDue to the complexity of the processes used to manufacture our products and product candidates, we may be unable to continue to pass or initially pass federal or international regulatory inspections in a cost-effective manner. For the same reason, any potential third-party manufacturer of Vimizim, Naglazyme, Kuvan, Aldurazyme and Firdapse or our product candidates may be unable to comply with cGMP regulations in a cost-effective manner and may be unable to initially or continue to pass a federal or international regulatory inspection.\nIf we, or third-party manufacturers with whom we contract, are unable to comply with manufacturing regulations, we may be subject to delay of approval of our product candidates, warning or untitled letters, fines, unanticipated compliance expenses, recall or seizure of our products, total or partial suspension of production and/or enforcement actions, including injunctions, and criminal or civil prosecution. These possible sanctions would adversely affect our financial results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected and we will have to delay or terminate some or all of our product development programs.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term investments totaling $1,043.1 million and long-term debt obligations of $790.6 million (undiscounted). In January 2015, we paid $620.7 million for 34,970,514 Prosensa Shares, representing approximately 96.8% of all outstanding Prosensa Shares, and $38.6 million for the options that vested pursuant to the\ndefinitive purchase agreement. In February 2015, we completed the Prosensa asset transfer and paid $20.8 million to the remaining Prosensa shareholders. We (through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries) funded the acquisition with our available cash balances. We expect to pay up to $160.0 million if certain development milestones are attained. In October 2013, we completed an offering of senior subordinated convertible notes and received net proceeds of approximately $696.4 million, after deducting commissions, estimated offering expenses payable by us and the purchase of the related capped calls. We will need cash to not only repay the principal amount of our 0.75% senior subordinated convertible notes due 2018 and 1.50% senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2020 (collectively, the Notes) but also the ongoing interest due on the Notes during their term. In March 2014, we completed an offering of 1,500,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $78.45 per share and received net proceeds of $117.5 million. In January 2015, we completed an offering of 9,775,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $93.25 per share and received net proceeds of approximately $888.2 million. We may require additional financing to fund our future operations, including the commercialization of our approved drugs and drug product candidates currently under development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, and potential licenses and acquisitions. We may be unable to raise additional financing, if needed, due to a variety of factors, including our financial condition, the status of our product programs, and the general condition of the financial markets. If we fail to raise any necessary additional financing we may have to delay or terminate some or all of our product development programs and our financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.\nWe expect to continue to spend substantial amounts of capital for our operations for the foreseeable future. The amount of capital we will need depends on many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully market and sell Vimizim, Naglazyme, Kuvan and Firdapse;\n\u00b7\nGenzyme\u2019s ability to continue to successfully commercialize Aldurazyme;\n\u00b7\nthe progress and success of our preclinical studies and clinical trials (including studies and the manufacture of materials);\n\u00b7\nthe timing, number, size and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and the costs of post-marketing studies which may be required by regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nthe time and cost necessary to develop commercial manufacturing processes, including quality systems, and to build or acquire manufacturing capabilities;\n\u00b7\nthe progress of research programs carried out by us;\n\u00b7\nour possible achievement of milestones identified in our purchase agreements with the former stockholders of LEAD Therapeutics, Inc., ZyStor, Huxley Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Zacharon Pharmaceuticals Inc. that trigger related milestone payments;\n\u00b7\nany changes made to, or new developments in, our existing collaborative, licensing and other commercial relationships or any new collaborative, licensing and other commercial relationships that we may establish; and\n\u00b7\nwhether our convertible debt is converted to common stock in the future.\nMoreover, our fixed expenses such as rent, license payments, interest expense and other contractual commitments are substantial and may increase in the future. These fixed expenses may increase because we may enter into:\n\u00b7\nadditional licenses and collaborative agreements;\n\u00b7\nadditional contracts for product manufacturing; and\n\u00b7\nadditional financing facilities.\nWe may need to raise additional funds from equity or debt securities, loans or collaborative agreements if we are unable to satisfy our liquidity requirements. The sale of additional securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders. Furthermore, additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms satisfactory to us or at all. This could result in the delay, reduction or termination of our research, which could harm our business.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and maintain manufacturing processes for our drug products to produce sufficient quantities at acceptable costs, we may be unable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenue, have reduced margins or be forced to terminate a program.\nDue to the complexity of manufacturing our products, we may not be able to manufacture drug products successfully with a commercially viable process or at a scale large enough to support their respective commercial markets or at acceptable margins.\nThe development of commercially viable manufacturing processes typically is very difficult to achieve and is often very expensive and may require extended periods of time. Changes in manufacturing processes (including manufacturing cell lines), equipment or facilities may require us to complete clinical trials to receive regulatory approval of any manufacturing improvements. Also, we may be required to demonstrate product comparability between a biological product made after a manufacturing change and the product made before implementation of the change through additional types of analytical and functional testing or may have to complete additional clinical studies. If we contract for manufacturing services with an unproven process, our contractor is subject to the same uncertainties, high standards and regulatory controls, and may therefore experience difficulty if further process development is necessary.\nEven a developed manufacturing process can encounter difficulties. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including human error, mechanical breakdowns, problems with raw materials and cell banks, malfunctions of internal information technology systems, and other events that cannot always be prevented or anticipated. Many of the processes include biological systems, which add significant complexity, as compared to chemical synthesis. We expect that, from time to time, consistent with biotechnology industry expectations, certain production lots will fail to produce product that meets our quality control release acceptance criteria. To date, our historical failure rates for all of our product programs, including Naglazyme, Aldurazyme and Vimizim, have been within our expectations, which are based on industry norms. If the failure rate increased substantially, we could experience increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense investigating the cause and, depending upon the cause, similar losses with respect to other lots or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred.\nIn order to produce product within our time and cost parameters, we must continue to produce product within our expected success rate and yield expectations. Because of the complexity of our manufacturing processes, it may be difficult or impossible for us to determine the cause of any particular lot failure and we must effectively take corrective action in response to any failure in a timely manner.\nAlthough we have entered into contractual relationships with third-party manufacturers to produce the active ingredient in Kuvan and Firdapse, if those manufacturers are unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations, we may be unable to meet demand for these products or sell these products at all and we may lose potential revenue. We have contracts for the production of final product for Kuvan and Firdapse. We also rely on third-parties for portions of the manufacture of Naglazyme and Aldurazyme. If those manufacturers are unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or satisfy demand outside of or in excess of the contractual obligations, we may be unable to meet demand for these products or sell these products at all and we may lose potential revenue. Further, the availability of suitable contract manufacturing capacity at scheduled or optimum times is not certain.\nIn addition, our manufacturing processes subject us to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes resulting from their use. We may incur significant costs in complying with these laws and regulations.\nIf we are unable to effectively address manufacturing issues, we may be unable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenue, have reduced margins, or be forced to terminate a program.\nOur manufacturing facility for Naglazyme, Aldurazyme and Vimizim is located near known earthquake fault zones, and the occurrence of an earthquake or other catastrophic disaster could cause damage to our facility and equipment, or that of our third-party manufacturers or single-source suppliers, which could materially impair our ability to manufacture Naglazyme, Aldurazyme and Vimizim or our third-party manufacturer\u2019s ability to manufacture Kuvan or Firdapse.\nOur Galli Drive facility located in Novato, California is currently our only manufacturing facility for Naglazyme, Aldurazyme and Vimizim. It is located in the San Francisco Bay Area near known earthquake fault zones and is vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes. We, the third-party manufacturers with whom we contract and our single-source suppliers of raw materials, which include many of our critical raw materials, are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including fires, floods, power loss and similar events. If any disaster were to occur, or any terrorist or criminal activity caused significant damage to our facilities or the facilities of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers, our ability to manufacture Naglazyme, Aldurazyme and Vimizim, or to have Kuvan or Firdapse manufactured, could be seriously, or potentially completely impaired, and our commercialization efforts and revenue could be seriously impaired. The insurance that we carry, the inventory that we maintain and our risk mitigation plans may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions.\nSupply interruptions may disrupt our inventory levels and the availability of our products and product candidates and cause delays in obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, or harm our business by reducing our revenues.\nNumerous factors could cause interruptions in the supply of our products and product candidates, including:\n\u00b7\ntiming, scheduling and prioritization of production by our contract manufacturers or a breach of our agreements by our contract manufacturers;\n\u00b7\nlabor interruptions;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our sources for manufacturing;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and delivery of shipments;\n\u00b7\nour failure to locate and obtain replacement manufacturers as needed on a timely basis; and\n\u00b7\nconditions affecting the cost and availability of raw materials.\nAny interruption in the supply of finished products could hinder our ability to distribute finished products to meet commercial demand.\nWith respect to our product candidates, production of product is necessary to perform clinical trials and successful registration batches are necessary to file for approval to commercially market and sell product candidates. Delays in obtaining clinical material or registration batches could adversely impact our clinical trials and delay regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nBecause the target patient populations for our products are small, we must achieve significant market share and maintain high per-patient prices for our products to achieve profitability.\nAll of our products target diseases with small patient populations. As a result, our per-patient prices must be relatively high in order to recover our development and manufacturing costs and achieve profitability. For Naglazyme and Vimizim we must market worldwide to achieve significant market penetration of the product. In addition, because the number of potential patients in the disease populations are small, it is not only important to find patients who begin therapy to achieve significant market penetration of the product, but we also need to be able to maintain these patients on therapy for an extended period of time. Due to the expected costs of treatment for our products for genetic diseases, we may be unable to maintain or obtain sufficient market share at a price high enough to justify our product development efforts and manufacturing expenses.\nIf we fail to obtain an adequate level of coverage and reimbursement for our drug products by third-party payers, the sales of our drugs would be adversely affected or there may be no commercially viable markets for our products.\nThe course of treatment for patients using our products is expensive. We expect patients to need treatment for extended periods, and for some products throughout the lifetimes of the patients. We expect that most families of patients will not be capable of paying for this treatment themselves. There will be no commercially viable market for our products without coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Additionally, even if there is a commercially viable market, if the level of reimbursement is below our expectations, our revenue and gross margins will be adversely affected.\nThird-party payers, such as government or private health care insurers, carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for drugs. Reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the third-party payer, the insurance plan and other factors. Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis.\nReimbursement in the EU and many other territories must be negotiated on a country-by-country basis and in many countries the product cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved. The timing to complete the negotiation process in each country is highly uncertain, and in some countries we expect that it may exceed 12 months. Even after a price is negotiated, countries frequently request or require adjustments to the price and other concessions over time.\nFor our future products, we will not know what the reimbursement rates will be until we are ready to market the product and we actually negotiate the rates. If we are unable to obtain sufficiently high reimbursement rates for our products, they may not be commercially viable or our future revenues and gross margins may be adversely affected.\nA significant portion of our international sales are made based on special access programs, and changes to these programs could adversely affect our product sales and revenue in these countries.\nWe make a significant portion of our international sales of Naglazyme through special access or \u201cnamed patient\u201d programs, which do not require full product approval. We expect to also utilize these programs for Vimizim. The specifics of the programs vary from country to country. Generally, special approval must be obtained for each patient. The approval normally requires an application or a lawsuit accompanied by evidence of medical need. Generally, the approvals for each patient must be renewed from time to time.\nThese programs are not well defined in some countries and are subject to changes in requirements and funding levels. Any change to these programs could adversely affect our ability to sell our products in those countries and delay sales. If the programs are not funded by the respective government, there could be insufficient funds to pay for all patients. Further, governments have in the past undertaken and may in the future undertake, unofficial measures to limit purchases of our products, including initially denying coverage for purchasers, delaying orders and denying or taking excessively long to approve customs clearance. Any such actions could materially delay or reduce our revenues from such countries.\nWithout the special access programs, we would need to seek full product approval to commercially market and sell our products. This can be an expensive and time-consuming process and may subject our products to additional price controls. Because the number of patients is so small in some countries, it may not be economically feasible to seek and maintain a full product approval, and therefore the sales in such country would be permanently reduced or eliminated. For all of these reasons, if the special access programs that we are currently using are eliminated or restricted, our revenues could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to compete successfully with respect to product sales, we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to recover our expenses related to the development of a product program or to justify continued marketing of a product and our revenue could be adversely affected.\nOur competitors may develop, manufacture and market products that are more effective or less expensive than ours. They may also obtain regulatory approvals for their products faster than we can obtain them (including those products with orphan drug designation) or commercialize their products before we do. If we do not compete successfully, our revenue would be adversely affected, and we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to recover our expenses related to the development of a product program or to justify continued marketing of a product.\nGovernment price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our current and future products, which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nWe expect that coverage and reimbursement may be increasingly restricted both in the U.S. and internationally. The escalating cost of health care has led to increased pressure on the health care industry to reduce costs. Governmental and private third-party payers have proposed health care reforms and cost reductions. A number of federal and state proposals to control the cost of health care, including the cost of drug treatments, have been made in the U.S. In some international markets, the government controls the pricing, which can affect the profitability of drugs. Current government regulations and possible future legislation regarding health care may affect coverage and reimbursement for medical treatment by third-party payers, which may render our products not commercially viable or may adversely affect our future revenues and gross margins.\nInternational operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations, and there are many proposals for additional cost-containment measures, including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or mandatory price cuts or reduce the value of our intellectual property portfolio. As part of these cost containment measures, some countries have imposed or threatened to impose revenue caps limiting the annual volume of sales of Naglazyme. To the extent that these caps are significantly below actual demand, our future revenues and gross margins may be adversely affected.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments. However, future price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our current and future products, which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nGovernment health care reform could increase our costs, and would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nOur industry is highly regulated and changes in law may adversely impact our business, operations or financial results. The PPACA is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the U.S., primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the Medicaid program.\nSeveral provisions of the law, which have varying effective dates, may affect us and will likely increase certain of our costs. For example, the Medicaid rebate rate was increased and the volume of rebated drugs has been expanded to include beneficiaries in Medicaid managed care organizations. Among other things, the PPACA also expanded the 340B drug discount program (excluding orphan drugs), including the creation of new penalties for non-compliance; included a 50% discount on brand name drugs for Medicare Part D participants in the coverage gap, or \u201cdonut hole,\u201d and imposed a new fee on certain manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs (excluding orphan drugs under certain conditions). The law also revised the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of the Medicaid drug rebates paid to states.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, accordingly, our financial operations.\nWe anticipate that the PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and an additional downward pressure on the reimbursement our customers may receive for our products. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.\nWe face credit risks from customers outside of the U.S. that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur product sales to government-owned or supported customers in various countries outside of the U.S. are subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices. This has resulted and may continue to result in an increase in days sales outstanding due to the average length of time that we have accounts receivable outstanding. If significant changes were to occur in the reimbursement practices of these governments or if government funding becomes unavailable, we may not be able to collect on amounts due to us from these customers and our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we are found in violation of federal or state \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws, we may be required to pay a penalty or be suspended from participation in federal or state health care programs, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe are subject to various federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws and laws related to ensuring compliance. The federal health care program anti-kickback statute makes it illegal for any person, including a pharmaceutical company, to knowingly and willfully offer, solicit, pay or receive any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Under federal government regulations, certain arrangements, or safe harbors, are deemed not to violate the federal anti-kickback statute. However, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration not intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability, although we seek to comply with these safe harbors. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.\nFederal and state false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, we also are prohibited from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payers, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer\u2019s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment.\nMany states have adopted laws similar to the federal anti-kickback statute, some of which apply to referral of patients for health care services reimbursed by any source, not just governmental payers.\nSubstantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been adopted, which may require us to modify our business practices with health care practitioners. The PPACA, among other things, requires drug manufacturers to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment and ownership interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Manufacturers were required to begin collecting required information on August 1, 2013 and the CMS made public the reported data in a searchable form on September 30, 2014. Manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased state regulation of payments made to physicians. Certain states mandate implementation of compliance programs, compliance with the Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and the PhRMA Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals, and/or the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. The shifting compliance environment and the need to implement systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a pharmaceutical manufacturer may violate one or more of the requirements.\nWhile we believe we have structured our business arrangements to comply with these laws, because of the breadth of these laws, the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exceptions and the increased focus by law enforcement agencies in enforcing such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened, these laws. For example, the PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. If we are found in violation of one of these laws, we may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including debarment, suspension or exclusion from participation in federal or state health care programs any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe conduct a significant amount of our sales and operations outside of the U.S., which subjects us to additional business risks that could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nA significant portion of the sales of Aldurazyme and Naglazyme and all of the sales of Firdapse are generated from countries other than the U.S. Additionally, we have operations in several European countries, Brazil, other Latin American countries, Turkey and other Asian countries. We expect that we will continue to expand our international operations in the future. International operations inherently subject us to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u00b7\nchanges in international regulatory and compliance requirements that could restrict our ability to manufacture, market and sell our products;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u00b7\ndiminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the U.S.;\n\u00b7\ntrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u00b7\ndiffering labor regulations and business practices;\n\u00b7\npotentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n\u00b7\nchanges in international medical reimbursement policies and programs;\n\u00b7\nfinancial risks such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable and exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and\n\u00b7\nregulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors\u2019 and service providers\u2019 activities that may fall within the purview of the FCPA.\nAny of these factors may, individually or as a group, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAs we continue to expand our existing international operations, we may encounter new risks. For example, as we focus on building our international sales and distribution networks in new geographic regions, we must continue to develop relationships with qualified local distributors and trading companies. If we are not successful in developing and maintaining these relationships, we may not be able to grow sales in these geographic regions. These or other similar risks could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nOur international operations pose currency risks, which may adversely affect our operating results and net income.\nA significant and growing portion of our revenues and earnings, as well as our substantial international net assets, are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. As we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the euro, the Brazilian real, the U.K. pound, the Canadian dollar, the Swiss Franc, the Japanese yen and several other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. If the U.S. dollar were to weaken against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would increase, having a positive impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would increase, having a negative impact on earnings. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar were to strengthen against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would decrease, having a negative impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would decrease, having a positive impact on earnings. In addition, because our financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. Therefore, significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance.\nFrom time to time, we may implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, our hedging strategies may not be successful, and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations. Moreover, when we do implement currency hedges, we only hedge our net exposure, or the difference between our revenues in a currency and the offsetting expenses in that currency. Since we do not generally hedge the portion of our revenues that has offsetting expenses in that currency, our revenues can be particularly affected by changes in exchange rates. These risks could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nIf we are unable to protect our proprietary technology, we may not be able to compete as effectively.\nWhere appropriate, we seek patent protection for certain aspects of our technology. Patent protection may not be available for some of the products we are developing. If we must spend significant time and money protecting or enforcing our patents, designing around patents held by others or licensing, potentially for large fees, patents or other proprietary rights held by others, our business and financial prospects may be harmed.\nThe patent positions of biopharmaceutical products are complex and uncertain. The scope and extent of patent protection for some of our products and product candidates are particularly uncertain because key information on some of our product candidates has existed in the public domain for many years. The composition and genetic sequences of animal and/or human versions of Naglazyme, Aldurazyme and many of our product candidates have been published and are believed to be in the public domain. The chemical structure of 6R-BH4 (the active ingredient in Kuvan) and 3,4-DAP (the active ingredient in Firdapse) have also been published. Publication of this information may prevent us from obtaining or enforcing patents relating to our products and product candidates, including without limitation composition-of-matter patents, which are generally believed to offer the strongest patent protection.\nWe own or have licensed patents and patent applications related to Vimizim, Naglazyme, Kuvan, Aldurazyme and Firdapse. However, these patents and patent applications do not ensure the protection of our intellectual property for a number of reasons, including without limitation the following:\n\u00b7\nWith respect to pending patent applications, unless and until actually issued, the protective value of these applications is impossible to determine. We do not know whether our patent applications will result in issued patents.\n\u00b7\nCompetitors may interfere with our patent process in a variety of ways. Competitors may claim that they invented the claimed invention prior to us or that they filed their application for a patent on a claimed invention before we did. Competitors may also claim that we are infringing on their patents and therefore we cannot practice our technology. Competitors may also contest our patents by showing the patent examiner or a court that the invention was not original, was not novel or was obvious, for example. In litigation, a competitor could claim that our issued patents are not valid or are unenforceable for a number of reasons. If a court agrees, we would not be able to enforce that patent. We have no meaningful experience with competitors interfering with or challenging the validity or enforceability of our patents or patent applications.\n\u00b7\nEnforcing patents is expensive and may absorb significant time of our management. Management would spend less time and resources on developing products, which could increase our operating expenses and delay product programs. We may not have the financial ability to sustain a patent infringement action, or it may not be financially reasonable to do so.\n\u00b7\nReceipt of a patent may not provide much, if any, practical protection. For example, if we receive a patent with a narrow scope, then it will be easier for competitors to design products that do not infringe on our patent\n\u00b7\nThe Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011, which reformed certain patent laws in the U.S., may create additional uncertainty. Among the significant changes are switching from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, and the implementation of new procedures that permit competitors to challenge our patents in the USPTO after grant.\nIt is also unclear whether our trade secrets are adequately protected. Our employees, consultants or contractors may unintentionally or willfully disclose trade secrets to competitors. Enforcing a claim that someone else illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets, as with patent litigation, is expensive and time consuming, requires significant resources and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside of the U.S. are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, in which case we would not be able to enforce our trade secret rights against such competitors.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, third parties could develop competing products, which could adversely affect our revenue and financial results generally.\nCompetitors and other third parties may have developed intellectual property that could limit our ability to market and commercialize our products and product candidates, if approved.\nSimilar to us, competitors continually seek intellectual property protection for their technology. Several of our development programs, such as talazoparib, reveglucosidase alfa, BMN 111 and BMN 270, focus on therapeutic areas that have been the subject of extensive research and development by third parties for many years. Due to the amount of intellectual property in our field of technology, we cannot be certain that we do not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors or that we will not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors granted or created in the future. For example, if a patent holder believes our product infringes its patent, the patent holder may sue us even if we have received patent protection for our technology. If someone else claims we infringe its intellectual property, we would face a number of issues, including the following:\n\u00b7\nDefending a lawsuit takes significant executive resources and can be very expensive.\n\u00b7\nIf a court decides that our product infringes a competitor\u2019s intellectual property, we may have to pay substantial damages.\n\u00b7\nWith respect to patents, in addition to requiring us to pay substantial damages, a court may prohibit us from making, selling, offering to sell, importing or using our product unless the patent holder licenses the patent to us. The patent holder is not required to grant us a license. If a license is available, it may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. For example, we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patents and patent applications.\n\u00b7\nWe may need to redesign our product so it does not infringe the intellectual property rights of others.\n\u00b7\nRedesigning our product so it does not infringe the intellectual property rights of competitors may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time.\nWe may also support and collaborate in research conducted by government organizations, hospitals, universities or other educational institutions. These research partners may be unwilling to grant us any exclusive rights to technology or products derived from these collaborations.\nIf we do not obtain required licenses or rights, we could encounter delays in our product development efforts while we attempt to design around other patents or may be prohibited from making, using, importing, offering to sell or selling products requiring these licenses or rights. There is also a risk that disputes may arise as to the rights to technology or products developed in collaboration with other parties. If we are not able to resolve such disputes and obtain the licenses or rights we need, we may not be able to develop or market our products.\nIf our Manufacturing, Marketing and Sales Agreement with Genzyme were terminated, we could be prevented from continuing to commercialize Aldurazyme or our ability to successfully commercialize Aldurazyme would be delayed or diminished.\nEither party may terminate the Manufacturing, Marketing and Sales Agreement (the MMS Agreement) between Genzyme and us related to Aldurazyme for specified reasons, including if the other party is in material breach of the MMS Agreement, has experienced a change of control, as such term is defined in the MMS Agreement, or has declared bankruptcy and also is in breach of the MMS Agreement. Although we are not currently in breach of the MMS Agreement, there is a risk that either party could breach the MMS Agreement in the future. Either party may also terminate the MMS Agreement upon one year prior written notice for any reason.\nIf the MMS Agreement is terminated for breach, the breaching party will transfer its interest in the LLC to the non-breaching party, and the non-breaching party will pay a specified buyout amount for the breaching party\u2019s interest in Aldurazyme and in the LLC. If we are the breaching party, we would lose our rights to Aldurazyme and the related intellectual property and regulatory approvals. If the MMS Agreement is terminated without cause, the non-terminating party would have the option, exercisable for one year, to buy out the terminating party\u2019s interest in Aldurazyme and in the LLC at a specified buyout amount. If such option is not exercised, all rights to Aldurazyme will be sold and the LLC will be dissolved. In the event of termination of the buyout option without exercise by the non-terminating party as described above, all right and title to Aldurazyme is to be sold to the highest bidder, with the proceeds to be split between Genzyme and us in accordance with our percentage interest in the LLC.\nIf the MMS Agreement is terminated by either party because the other party declared bankruptcy, the terminating party would be obligated to buy out the other party and would obtain all rights to Aldurazyme exclusively. If the MMS Agreement is terminated by a party because the other party experienced a change of control, the terminating party shall notify the other party, the offeree, of its intent to buy out the offeree\u2019s interest in Aldurazyme and the LLC for a stated amount set by the terminating party at its discretion. The offeree must then either accept this offer or agree to buy the terminating party\u2019s interest in Aldurazyme and the LLC on those same terms. The party who buys out the other party would then have exclusive worldwide rights to Aldurazyme. The Amended and Restated Collaboration Agreement between us and Genzyme will automatically terminate upon the effective date of the termination of the MMS Agreement and may not be terminated independently from the MMS Agreement.\nIf we were obligated or given the option to buy out Genzyme\u2019s interest in Aldurazyme and the LLC, and thereby gain exclusive rights to Aldurazyme, we may not have sufficient funds to do so and we may not be able to obtain the financing to do so. If we fail to buy out Genzyme\u2019s interest, we may be held in breach of the agreement and may lose any claim to the rights to Aldurazyme and the related intellectual property and regulatory approvals. We would then effectively be prohibited from developing and commercializing Aldurazyme. If this happened, not only would our product revenues decrease, but our share price would also decline.\nBased on our strategic alliance with Merck Serono, unless Merck Serono \u201copts in\u201d to the pegvaliase program, we will not realize any cost sharing for the development expenses, development milestones, or royalties for ex-U.S. sales.\nIn May 2005, we entered into an agreement with Merck Serono for the further development and commercialization of Kuvan (and any other product containing 6R-BH4) and pegvaliase for PKU. Pursuant to that agreement, we received development milestones on Kuvan and receive royalties on sales by Merck Serono. Additionally, we may be entitled to development milestones and royalties related to pegvaliase. However, Merck Serono has \u201copted out\u201d of the pegvaliase development program. Unless and until it elects to opt in, it is not obligated to pay any of the milestones related to the program or to reimburse us for any of the development costs. Additionally, even though Merck Serono has opted out of the pegvaliase development program, we do not have any right to commercialize pegvaliase outside of the U.S. and Japan or to grant anyone else such rights.\nMerck Serono may elect to opt in at any time. If Merck Serono opts in to the pegvaliase development program before the unblinding of the first Phase 3 trial for pegvaliase, it must pay 75% of the Phase 3 costs incurred prior to the opt-in and the $7,000,000 Phase 3 initiation milestone. If it opts in after unblinding of the first Phase 3 trial for pegvaliase, it must pay 100% of the Phase 3 costs incurred prior to the opt-in and the $7,000,000 Phase 3 initiation milestone. Additionally, in all cases after it opts in to the pegvaliase development program, Merck Serono would be obligated to pay one half of future development costs under the agreement and any further milestones due under the agreement. If Merck Serono does not opt in, it will not have the right to use any of the clinical or other independently developed data.\nWe cannot determine when or if Merck Serono will opt in to the pegvaliase development program. If Merck Serono does not opt in, we will not receive any milestones under the agreement nor will there be any sales outside of the U.S. or Japan generating revenue from royalties or otherwise.\nIf we fail to compete successfully with respect to acquisitions, joint ventures or other collaboration opportunities, we may be limited in our ability to develop new products and to continue to expand our product pipeline.\nOur competitors compete with us to attract organizations for acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing arrangements or other collaborations. To date, several of our product programs have been acquired through acquisitions, such as reveglucosidase alfa and talazoparib and several of our product programs have been developed through licensing or collaborative arrangements, such as Naglazyme, Aldurazyme, Kuvan and Firdapse. These collaborations include licensing proprietary technology from, and other relationships with, academic research institutions. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to identify additional opportunities and to successfully enter into partnering or acquisition agreements for those opportunities. If our competitors successfully enter into partnering arrangements or license agreements with academic research institutions, we will then be precluded from pursuing those specific opportunities. Since each of these opportunities is unique, we may not be able to find a substitute. Several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have already established themselves in the field of genetic diseases. These companies have already begun many drug development programs, some of which may target diseases that we are also targeting, and have already entered into partnering and licensing arrangements with academic research institutions, reducing the pool of available opportunities.\nUniversities and public and private research institutions also compete with us. While these organizations primarily have educational or basic research objectives, they may develop proprietary technology and acquire patents that we may need for the development of our product candidates. We will attempt to license this proprietary technology, if available. These licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to compete successfully with respect to acquisitions, joint venture and other collaboration opportunities, we may be limited in our ability to develop new products and to continue to expand our product pipeline.\nIf generic manufacturers use litigation and regulatory means to obtain approval for generic versions of Kuvan, our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits the FDA to approve ANDAs for generic versions of branded drugs. We refer to this process as the ANDA process. The ANDA process permits competitor companies to obtain marketing approval for a drug with the same active ingredient as a branded drug, but does not generally require the conduct and submission of clinical efficacy studies for the generic product. In place of such clinical studies, an ANDA applicant usually needs only to submit data demonstrating that its product is bioequivalent to the branded product. Pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act, companies were permitted to file ANDA applications for proposed generic versions of Kuvan (sapropterin hydrochloride) at any time after December 2011.\nBioMarin owns several patents that cover Kuvan (sapropterin dihydrochloride), and we have listed those patents in conjunction with that product in the Orange Book. The Hatch-Waxman Act requires an ANDA applicant seeking FDA approval of its proposed generic product prior to the expiration of our Orange Book-listed patents to certify that the applicant believes that our patents are invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug for which the application has been submitted (a paragraph IV certification) and notify us of such certification (a paragraph IV notice). Upon receipt of a paragraph IV notice, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows us, with proper basis, to bring an action for patent infringement against the ANDA filer, asking that the proposed generic product not be approved until after our patents expire. If we commence a lawsuit within 45 days from receipt of the paragraph IV notice, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides a 30-month stay, during which time the FDA cannot finally approve the generic\u2019s application. If the litigation is resolved in favor of the ANDA applicant during the 30-month stay period, the stay is lifted and the FDA\u2019s review of the application may be completed. The discovery, trial and appeals process in such a lawsuit is costly, time consuming, and may result in generic competition if the ANDA applicant prevails. Regardless of any litigation results, generic versions of Kuvan (sapropterin dihydrochloride) would be prohibited until the expiration of orphan drug exclusivity in June 2015, including pediatric exclusivity, at the earliest. We have also received three-year Hatch-Waxman exclusivity for a New Patient Population for Kuvan (sapropterin dihydrochloride) that expires in October 2017, including pediatric exclusivity. Thus, depending on the proposed labeling of a generic product, generic versions of Kuvan (sapropterin dihydrochloride) may be prohibited until October 2017, though it is possible that an ANDA applicant could propose to carve out information in the Kuvan labeling protected by the New Patient Population exclusivity and obtain approval earlier.\nWe have received a paragraph IV notice letter, dated October 3, 2014, from DRL, notifying us that DRL has filed an ANDA seeking approval of a proposed generic version Kuvan (sapropterin dihydrochloride) 100 mg oral tablets prior to the expiration of our Orange Book-listed patents. On November 17, 2014, we, together with Merck, filed a lawsuit against DRL in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging patent infringement for our patents relating to Kuvan. On January 16, 2015, we, together with Merck, filed an Amended Complaint requesting a declaratory judgment that DRL has no legitimate basis to trigger the ANDA process, alleging that DRL did not have a proper ANDA because, upon information and belief, it did not submit proper bioequivalence data is in support of its purported ANDA. We also have received a paragraph IV notice letter, dated January 22, 2015, from Par, notifying us that Par has filed an ANDA seeking approval of a proposed generic version of Kuvan (sapropterin dihydrochloride) 100 mg oral tablets prior to the expiration of our patents listed in the Orange Book.\nThe filing of DRL\u2019s and Par\u2019s purported ANDAs in respect to Kuvan (sapropterin dihydrochloride) could have an adverse impact on our stock price, and litigation to enforce our patents is likely to cost a substantial amount and require significant management attention. If the patents covering Kuvan (sapropterin dihydrochloride) and its use are not upheld in litigation, or if DRL and/or Par is found to not infringe our asserted patents, the resulting generic competition following the expiration of regulatory exclusivity would have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development goals in the timeframes we announce and expect, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nFor planning purposes, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory and other product development goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings. From time to time, we publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones. All of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions. The actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in many cases for reasons beyond our control. If we do not meet these milestones as publicly announced, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nWe depend upon our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain employees.\nOur future growth and success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract, retain, manage and motivate our employees. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management or the inability to hire or retain experienced management personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results.\nBecause of the specialized scientific and managerial nature of our business, we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. In particular, the loss of one or more of our senior executive officers could be detrimental to us if we do not have an adequate succession plan or if we cannot recruit suitable replacements in a timely manner. While our senior executive officers are parties to employment agreements with us, these agreements do not guarantee that they will remain employed with us in the future. In addition, in many cases, these agreements do not restrict our senior executive officers\u2019 ability to compete with us after their employment is terminated. The competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field is intense, and there is a limited pool of qualified potential employees to recruit. Due to this intense competition, we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel. If we are unsuccessful in our recruitment and retention efforts, our business may be harmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to manage our growth.\nProduct candidates that we are currently developing or may acquire in the future may be intended for patient populations that are significantly larger than any of MPS I, MPS VI, PKU or LEMS. In order to continue development and marketing of these products, if approved, we will need to significantly expand our operations. To manage expansion effectively, we need to continue to develop and improve our research and development capabilities, manufacturing and quality capacities, sales and marketing capabilities, financial and administrative systems and standard processes for global operations. Our staff, financial resources, systems, procedures or controls may be inadequate to support our operations and may increase our exposure to regulatory and corruption risks and our management may be unable to manage successfully future market opportunities or our relationships with customers and other third-parties.\nChanges in methods of treatment of disease could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect revenues.\nEven if our drug products are approved, if doctors elect a course of treatment which does not include our drug products, this decision would reduce demand for our drug products and adversely affect revenues. For example, if gene therapy becomes widely used as a treatment of genetic diseases, the use of enzyme replacement therapy, such as Naglazyme, Vimizim, and Aldurazyme in MPS diseases, could be greatly reduced. Changes in treatment method can be caused by the introduction of other companies\u2019 products or the development of new technologies or surgical procedures which may not directly compete with ours, but which have the effect of changing how doctors decide to treat a disease.\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities.\nWe are exposed to the potential product liability risks inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of human pharmaceuticals. We currently maintain insurance against product liability lawsuits for the commercial sale of our products and for the clinical trials of our product candidates. Pharmaceutical companies must balance the cost of insurance with the level of coverage based on estimates of potential liability. Historically, the potential liability associated with product liability lawsuits for pharmaceutical products has been unpredictable. Although we believe that our current insurance is a reasonable estimate of our potential liability and represents a commercially reasonable balancing of the level of coverage as compared to the cost of the insurance, we may be subject to claims in connection with our clinical trials and commercial use of Vimizim, Naglazyme, Kuvan, Aldurazyme and Firdapse, or our clinical trials for pegvaliase, reveglucosidase alfa, talazoparib, BMN 111, cerliponase alfa or BMN 270 for which our insurance coverage may not be adequate and we may be unable to avoid significant liability if any product liability lawsuit is brought against us. If we are the subject of a successful product liability claim that exceeds the limits of any insurance coverage we obtain, we may incur substantial charges that would adversely affect our earnings and require the commitment of capital resources that might otherwise be available for the development and commercialization of our product programs.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nWe rely significantly on our information technology and manufacturing infrastructure to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, to manufacture and ship products to customers and to timely invoice them. Any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that infrastructure or security lapse of that technology, including cybersecurity incidents could harm our ability to operate our business effectively. Our ability to manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, to manufacture and ship our products to customers and timely invoice them depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, production management and other information systems. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software,\nattempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, misappropriation of our confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Cybersecurity incidents resulting in the failure of our enterprise resource planning system, production management or other systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security or other unauthorized access of these systems, may affect our ability to manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and result in delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations. A breach in security, unauthorized access resulting in misappropriation, theft, or sabotage with respect to our proprietary and confidential information, including research or clinical data, could require significant capital investments to remediate and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is affected by macroeconomic conditions.\nVarious macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business and the results of our operations and financial condition, including changes in inflation, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and overall economic conditions and uncertainties, including those resulting from the current and future conditions in the global financial markets. For instance, if inflation or other factors were to significantly increase our business costs, it may not be feasible to pass through price increases on to our customers due to the process by which health care providers are reimbursed for our products by the government. Interest rates, the liquidity of the credit markets and the volatility of the capital markets could also affect the value of our investments and our ability to liquidate our investments in order to fund our operations. We purchase or enter into a variety of financial instruments and transactions, including investments in commercial paper, the extension of credit to corporations, institutions and governments and hedging contracts. If any of the issuers or counter parties to these instruments were to default on their obligations, it could materially reduce the value of the transaction and adversely affect our cash flows.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014 approximately 4% of our net product revenues were from Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Russia. Approximately 8% of our total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2014 related to such countries and we have included an allowance for doubtful accounts for certain accounts receivable from Greece. If the financial conditions of these countries continues to decline, a substantial portion of the receivables may be uncollectable, which would mean we would have to provide for additional allowances for doubtful accounts or cease selling products in these countries, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, if one or more of these countries were unable to purchase our products, our revenue would be adversely affected. We also sell our products in other countries that face economic crises and local currency devaluation. Although we have historically collected receivables from customers in those countries, sustained weakness or further deterioration of the local economies and currencies may cause our customers in those countries to be unable to pay for our products with the same negative effect on our operations.\nInterest rates and the ability to access credit markets could also adversely affect the ability of our customers/distributors to purchase, pay for and effectively distribute our products. Similarly, these macroeconomic factors could affect the ability of our contract manufacturers, sole-source or single-source suppliers to remain in business or otherwise manufacture or supply product. Failure by any of them to remain a going concern could affect our ability to manufacture products.\nRecent and future regulatory actions and other events may adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of our senior subordinated convertible notes.\nWe expect that many investors in, and potential purchasers of, the Notes will employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the Notes. Investors would typically implement such a strategy by selling short the common stock underlying the Notes and dynamically adjusting their short position while continuing to hold the Notes. Investors may also implement this type of strategy by entering into swaps on our common stock in lieu of or in addition to short selling the common stock.\nThe SEC and other regulatory and self-regulatory authorities have implemented various rules and taken certain actions, and may in the future adopt additional rules and take other actions, that may impact those engaging in short selling activity involving equity securities (including our common stock). Such rules and actions include Rule 201 of SEC Regulation SHO, the adoption by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. of a \u201cLimit Up-Limit Down\u201d program, the imposition of market-wide circuit breakers that halt trading of securities for certain periods following specific market declines, and the implementation of certain regulatory reforms required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Any governmental or regulatory action that restricts the ability of investors in, or potential purchasers of, the Notes to effect short sales of our common stock or enter into swaps on our common stock could adversely affect the trading price and the liquidity of the Notes.\nIn addition, if investors and potential purchasers seeking to employ a convertible arbitrage strategy are unable to borrow or enter into swaps on our common stock, in each case on commercially reasonable terms, the trading price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Acquisition of Prosensa Holding N.V.\nIf we do not successfully integrate Prosensa into our business operations, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe will need to successfully integrate the operations of Prosensa with our business operations. Integrating the operations of Prosensa with that of our own will be a complex and time-consuming process. Prior to the acquisition, Prosensa operated independently, with its own business, corporate culture, locations, employees and systems. There may be substantial difficulties, costs and delays involved in any integration of the business of Prosensa with that of our own. These may include:\n\u00b7\ndistracting management from day-to-day operations;\n\u00b7\npotential incompatibility of corporate cultures;\n\u00b7\nan inability to achieve synergies as planned;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the combined business due to potential divestitures or other requirements imposed by antitrust regulators;\n\u00b7\ncosts and delays in implementing common systems and procedures; and\n\u00b7\nincreased difficulties in managing our business due to the addition of international locations.\nMany of these risks may be accentuated because the majority of Prosensa\u2019s operations, employees and customers are located outside of the U.S. Any one or all of these factors may increase operating costs or lower anticipated financial performance. Many of these factors are also outside of our control. Achieving anticipated synergies and the potential benefits underlying our reasons for the acquisition will depend on successful integration of the businesses. The failure to integrate the business operations of Prosensa successfully would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe actual impact of the acquisition on our capital structure and financial results may be worse than the assumptions we have used.\nEven if the integration is successful, we have made certain assumptions relating to the impact on our capital structure and financial results in respect of the acquisition. These assumptions relate to numerous matters, including:\n\u00b7\nour expected capital structure after the acquisition;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of goodwill and intangibles that will result from the acquisition;\n\u00b7\ncertain other purchase accounting adjustments that we expect will be recorded in our financial statements in connection with the acquisition;\n\u00b7\nacquisition costs, including restructuring charges and transaction costs; and\n\u00b7\nother financial and strategic risks of the acquisition.\nIrrespective of our assumptions, we may incur higher than expected operating, transaction and integration costs, and we may encounter general economic and business conditions that adversely affect the combined company following the acquisition. If one or more of these assumptions are incorrect, it could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results, and the perceived benefits from the acquisition may not be realized.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities as a result of the acquisition.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Proposals by the current U.S. administration for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, including without limitation provisions that would limit the ability of U.S. multinationals to defer U.S. taxes on foreign income, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate following the acquisition.\nWe are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of the acquisition that may negatively impact our operations.\nAs a result of the acquisition, we are subject to new and additional risks associated with the business and operations of Prosensa and its global operations. The additional risks we may be exposed to include but are not limited to the following:\n\u00b7\ntariffs and trade barriers;\n\u00b7\nregulations related to customs and import/export matters (including sanctions);\n\u00b7\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u00b7\ntax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the jurisdictions in which we already operate;\n\u00b7\noperating under regulations in new jurisdictions related to obtaining eligibility for government or private payer reimbursement for our products at the wholesale/retail level;\n\u00b7\ncultural and language differences in the new jurisdictions in which we will operate;\n\u00b7\ncomplying with additional employment regulations in the new jurisdictions in which we will operate; and\n\u00b7\nrisks related to crimes, strikes, riots, civil disturbances, terrorist attacks and wars in new geographical locations.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we are unable to do so, our operations might suffer.\nAdditionally, although prior to the acquisition we had international operations, as a result of the acquisition, we operate on an expanded global basis with additional offices or activities in Europe. We will face increased exposure to risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with international laws and regulations and laws and regulations of the U.S. and various other countries that apply to our international operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include laws relating to the pharmaceutical industry, data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, export requirements, U.S. laws such as the FCPA, other U.S. federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and local laws which prohibit payments to governmental officials. Given the high level of complexity of these laws, however, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently breached by us, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements, or otherwise. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these challenges. These factors or any combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue or our overall financial performance.\nWe will incur significant transaction, integration and restructuring costs in connection with the acquisition.\nWe have incurred significant transaction costs related to the acquisition. In addition, the combined business will incur integration and restructuring costs following the completion of the acquisition as we integrate Prosensa\u2019s businesses with our businesses. Although we expect that the realization of benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may offset over time these transaction and integration and restructuring costs, no assurances can be made that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nProsensa depends heavily on the success of drisapersen. Drisapersen is still in clinical development. If we are unable to commercialize drisapersen or experience significant delays in doing so, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to generate product revenues from Prosensa will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of drisapersen.\nIn September 2013, Prosensa announced that the Phase 3 clinical trial of drisapersen did not meet its primary endpoint. Although we believe that the collective data from Prosensa\u2019s various Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials of drisapersen, including retrospective and subgroup analyses, provide strong support for concluding that drisapersen showed clinically meaningful improvements over placebo in these trials, we cannot be sure that Prosensa\u2019s data will be sufficient to satisfy the EMA or the FDA. We may need to conduct additional clinical trials at significant delay and cost or abandon development of drisapersen altogether.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for and are able to commercialize drisapersen, our success will be subject to the following risks:\n\u00b7\nwe may not achieve market acceptance of drisapersen by physicians, patients and third-party payers;\n\u00b7\ndrisapersen may not have an acceptable safety profile following approval;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to manufacture drisapersen in compliance with requirements of the EMA, the FDA and similar regulatory agencies in commercial quantities sufficient to meet market demand;\n\u00b7\nwe may not achieve sufficient pricing for drisapersen to compensate for future development and commercialization costs and to recoup our cost to acquire Prosensa;\n\u00b7\nwe may not compete successfully with any alternative therapies for DMD; and\n\u00b7\nwe may not successfully enforce and defend our intellectual property rights and claims.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur conclusions regarding the efficacy of drisapersen are based on retrospective analyses of the results of Prosensa\u2019s clinical trials, and these analyses may be considered less reliable indicators of efficacy than pre-specified analyses.\nAfter determining that it did not achieve the primary efficacy endpoint in the completed Phase 3 clinical trial of drisapersen, Prosensa performed retrospective and subgroup analyses of the Phase 3 clinical trial and prior Phase 2 clinical trials of drisapersen that we believe provide strong support for concluding that drisapersen showed clinically meaningful improvements over placebo in these trials. Although Prosensa believed that these additional analyses were warranted, a retrospective analysis performed after unblinding trial results can result in the introduction of bias if the analysis is inappropriately tailored or influenced by knowledge of the data and actual results. Because of these limitations, regulatory authorities typically give greatest weight to results from pre-specified analyses and less weight to results from post-hoc, retrospective analyses. Thus, this increases the likelihood that we will have to conduct an additional clinical trial or trials of drisapersen before we can apply for marketing approval.\nBecause Prosensa was developing product candidates for the treatment of diseases in which there is little clinical experience and, in some cases, using new endpoints or methodologies, there is more risk that the outcome of clinical trials for Prosensa\u2019s product candidates will not be favorable.\nThere is currently no approved disease-modifying therapy for DMD. In addition, there has been limited historical clinical trial experience generally for the development of drugs to treat the underlying cause of DMD. As a result, the design and conduct of clinical trials for this disease, particularly for drugs to address the underlying cause of this disease, are subject to increased risks. In particular, regulatory authorities in the U.S. and the EU have not issued definitive guidance as to how to measure and achieve efficacy.\nIn the last several years, the 6MWT has been used in several trials of product candidates for patients with DMD, and is accepted by U.S. and European regulators to be an appropriate primary outcome measure for DMD trials. Because of the limited clinical experience in this indication however, regulators have not yet established what difference in the 6MWD is required to be demonstrated in a clinical trial of a DMD therapy in order to signify a clinically meaningful result and/or obtain regulatory approvals. As a result, it is not clear what is required in terms of 6MWD or other end points to obtain regulatory approval for drisapersen and our other product candidates acquired from Prosensa. If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials of drisapersen, the design of such trials could be subject to such uncertainties.\nWe could also face similar challenges in designing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval for future product candidates, including any that we may develop for myotonic dystrophy or Huntington\u2019s disease because there is also limited historical clinical trial experience for the development of drugs to treat these diseases.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nOur stock price may be volatile, and an investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value.\nOur valuation and stock price since the beginning of trading after our initial public offering have had no meaningful relationship to current or historical earnings, asset values, book value or many other criteria based on conventional measures of stock value. The market price of our common stock will fluctuate due to factors including:\n\u00b7\nproduct sales and profitability of Vimizim, Naglazyme, Kuvan, Aldurazyme and Firdapse;\n\u00b7\nmanufacture, supply or distribution of Vimizim, Naglazyme, Kuvan, Aldurazyme and Firdapse;\n\u00b7\nprogress of our integration of Prosensa;\n\u00b7\nprogress of our product candidates through the regulatory process and our ability to successfully commercialize any such products that receive regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nresults of clinical trials, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nresults relating to our lawsuit against DRL to protect our patents relating to Kuvan;\n\u00b7\ngovernment regulatory action affecting our product candidates or our competitors\u2019 drug products in both the U.S. and non-U.S. countries;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent or proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\ngeneral market conditions and fluctuations for the emerging growth and pharmaceutical market sectors;\n\u00b7\neconomic conditions in the U.S. or abroad;\n\u00b7\nbroad market fluctuations in the U.S., the EU or in other parts of the world;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in company assessments or financial estimates by securities analysts.\nIn the past, following periods of large price declines in the public market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against that company. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which would hurt our business. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities. In addition, our stock price can be materially adversely affected by factors beyond our control, such as disruptions in global financial markets or negative trends in the biotechnology sector of the economy, even if our business is operating well.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law may make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult.\nWe are incorporated in Delaware. Certain anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our charter documents as currently in effect may make a change in control of our company more difficult, even if a change in control would be beneficial to the stockholders. Our anti-takeover provisions include provisions in our certificate of incorporation providing that stockholders\u2019 meetings may only be called by our Board of Directors and provisions in our bylaws providing that the stockholders may not take action by written consent and requiring that stockholders that desire to nominate any person for election to our Board of Directors or to make any proposal with respect to business to be conducted at a meeting of our stockholders be submitted in appropriate form to our Secretary within a specified period of time in advance of any such meeting. Additionally, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares of stock without any further action by our stockholders. The rights of holders of our common stock are subject to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued. The issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Delaware law also prohibits corporations from engaging in a business combination with any holders of 15% or more of their capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless, among other possibilities, our Board of Directors approves the transaction. Our Board of Directors may use these provisions to prevent changes in the management and control of our company. Also, under applicable Delaware law, our Board of Directors may adopt additional anti-takeover measures in the future.", "PERMNO": 87056, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "BMRN"}
