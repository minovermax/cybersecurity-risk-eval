We have described below the known material risks that we and our subsidiaries face. There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be significant that may also impact our business or the business of our subsidiaries. Each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or equity of us or one or more of our subsidiaries, which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock. You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports that we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before investing in any securities issued by us.\nRisks Relating to Our Tobacco Business\nLiggett faces intense competition in the domestic tobacco industry.\nLiggett is considerably smaller and has fewer resources than its major competitors, and, as a result, has in certain circumstances a more limited ability to respond to market developments. Further, all of Liggett\u2019s unit volume is generated in the discount segment, which is highly competitive, with consumers having less brand loyalty and placing greater emphasis on price. Management Science Associates\u2019 data indicate that in 2021, Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds, the two largest cigarette manufacturers, controlled 73.8% of the United States cigarette market. Philip Morris is the largest manufacturer in the market, and its profits are derived principally from its sale of premium cigarettes. Philip Morris had 57.5% of the premium segment and 44.3% of the total domestic market during 2021. During 2021, all of Liggett\u2019s sales were in the discount segment, and its share of the total domestic cigarette market was 4.1%. Historically, because of their dominant market share, Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds, have been able to determine cigarette prices for the various pricing tiers within the industry.\nFurther consolidation in the industry could adversely affect our ability to compete in the U.S. cigarette market.\nLiggett\u2019s business is highly dependent on the discount cigarette segment and to maintain market share, it may be required to take steps to reduce prices.\nAll of Liggett\u2019s unit volume is generated in the discount segment, which is highly competitive. While Philip Morris, RJ Reynolds, and ITG Brands compete with Liggett in the discount segment of the market, Liggett also faces intense competition for market share in the discount segment from a group of smaller manufacturers and importers, most of which sell low quality deep discount cigarettes. While Liggett\u2019s share of the discount market was 14.4% in 2021, 14.2% in 2020, and 14.3% in 2019, Management Science Associates\u2019 data indicate that the discount market share of these other smaller manufacturers and importers was approximately 34.2% in 2021, 35.5% in 2020, and 32.3% in 2019. If pricing in the discount market continues to be impacted by these smaller manufacturers and importers, margins in Liggett\u2019s only market segment could be negatively affected and, to maintain market share, Liggett may be required to take steps to reduce prices. Thus, Liggett\u2019s sales volume, operating income and cash flows would be materially adversely affected, which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nThe domestic cigarette industry has experienced declining unit sales in recent periods, which could result in lower sales or higher costs for us.\nManagement Science Associates\u2019 data indicated that domestic industry-wide shipments of cigarettes declined by approximately 6.5% in 2021, increased by 1.5% in 2020, and declined by 5.3% in 2019. Since 1995, industry-wide shipments of cigarettes declined have declined in all years except 2020. We believe the 2020 increase in shipments was a COVID-19 related anomaly and that industry-wide shipments of cigarettes in the United States will continue to decline in future years as a result of numerous factors. These factors include health considerations, diminishing social acceptance of smoking, and a wide variety of federal, state and local laws limiting smoking in restaurants, bars and other public places, as well as increases in federal and state excise taxes and settlement-related expenses which have contributed to higher cigarette prices in recent years. In addition to a declining market impacting our sales volume, operating income and cash flows, our annual cost advantage from our payment exemption under the MSA declines by approximately $1.8 million for each percentage point decline in shipment volumes in the U.S. market and approximately $1.6 million for each percentage point increase in inflation (with the MSA rate increasing each year by the lesser of three percent or the Consumer Price Index increase). If this decline in industry-wide shipments continues and Liggett is unable to capture market share from its competitors, or if the industry as a whole is unable to offset the decline in unit sales with price increases, or if Liggett\u2019s market share percentage falls below its MSA payment\nexemption percentage, or if prevailing inflation rates continue, Liggett\u2019s sales volume, operating income and cash flows could be negatively affected, which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nOur tobacco operations are subject to substantial and increasing legislation, regulation and taxation, which have a negative effect on revenue and profitability.\nCigarettes are subject to substantial regulation and taxation at the federal, state and local levels, which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business. For a more complete discussion of the material regulations and taxation applicable to our Business, see Item 1. Business. Legislation and Regulation. For instance:\n\u2022Federal, state and local laws have limited the advertising, sale and use of cigarettes in the United States, such as laws prohibiting smoking in restaurants and other public places. Private businesses have also implemented prohibitions on the use of cigarettes. Further regulations or rules limiting advertising, sale or use of cigarettes or ingredients or flavorings could negatively impact sales of cigarettes, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\u2022The federal government, as well as certain state, city and county governments, impose excise taxes on cigarettes, which has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse effect on sales of cigarettes. Since certain of these excise taxes were proportionately smaller on other types of tobacco products, a dramatic increase in the sale of mislabeled pipe tobacco occurred, which took away market share from traditional cigarette products.\n\u2022Various state and local government regulations have, among other things, increased the minimum age to purchase tobacco products, banned the sale of menthol cigarettes, restricted or banned sampling and advertising and required ingredient and constituent disclosure. Significantly, the federal government increased the minimum age of sale for tobacco products from 18 to 21 years of age in December 2019. Further regulations that limit the group of individuals able to purchase cigarettes in the United States or other regulations that limit the types of products we can offer, such as limitations on use of flavoring, could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products, our results of operations and our business. FDA and other organizations have also conducted anti-tobacco media campaigns, which have and may continue to have an adverse effect on the demand for cigarettes.\nThere have also been adverse legislative and political decisions and other unfavorable developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry, as well as restrictive actions by federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and FDA. Additionally, all states have enacted statutes requiring cigarettes to meet a reduced ignition propensity standard. These developments may negatively affect the perception of potential triers of fact with respect to the tobacco industry, possibly to the detriment of certain pending litigation, and may prompt the commencement of additional similar litigation or legislation. We are not able to evaluate the effect of these developing matters on pending litigation or the possible commencement of additional litigation, but our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nAdditional federal, state or local regulations relating to the manufacture, sale, distribution, advertising, labeling, or information disclosure of tobacco products could further reduce sales, increase costs and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFDA Regulation under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act may adversely affect our sales and operating profit.\nIn June 2009, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (the \u201cTCA\u201d) became law. The TCA grants FDA broad authority over the manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco products, although FDA is prohibited from banning all cigarettes or all smokeless tobacco products. For a more complete discussion of the TCA, see Item 1. Business. Legislation and Regulation.\nOn January 27, 2022, FDA announced that it expects to issue a proposed rule to prohibit menthol as a characterizing flavor in cigarettes by the spring of 2022. For the last twelve months ended March 31, 2021, approximately 19% of our cigarette unit sales were menthol flavored. We cannot predict how a tobacco product standard or a restriction on the sale and distribution of tobacco products with menthol, if ultimately issued by FDA, will impact product sales, whether it will have a material adverse effect on Liggett or Vector Tobacco, or whether it will impact Liggett and Vector Tobacco to a greater degree than other companies in the industry.\nAs part of the comprehensive plan announced in July 2017, FDA said it would focus on nicotine addiction, with the goal of lowering nicotine levels in combustible cigarettes through a product standard developed through notice and comment rulemaking, which FDA announced in March 2018. See Item 1. Business. Legislation and Regulation. At this time, we cannot predict the specific regulations FDA will enact, the timeframe for such regulations, or the effect of such regulations. The rulemaking process could take years and once a final rule is issued it typically does not take effect for at least one year. We\ncannot predict how a nicotine tobacco product standard, if ultimately issued by FDA, would impact product sales, whether it would have a material adverse effect on Liggett or Vector Tobacco, or whether it would impact Liggett and Vector Tobacco to a greater degree than other companies in the industry.\nIn April 2018, FDA announced a change in its process for reviewing \u201cprovisional\u201d substantial equivalence applications. See Item 1. Business. Legislation and Regulation for additional information on the substantial equivalence process. Vector Tobacco received a letter from FDA in April 2018 advising that FDA does not intend to conduct further review of Vector Tobacco\u2019s remaining applications, with certain \u201cconditions\u201d (as described under Item 1. Business. Legislation and Regulation). Liggett received a letter from FDA in May 2018 advising that FDA does not intend to conduct further review for certain applications, also with certain \u201cconditions\u201d (as described under Item 1. Business. Legislation and Regulation). FDA has not indicated whether the applications relating to Liggett\u2019s other products, not covered by that May 2018 letter, would proceed through FDA review. We cannot predict whether FDA will deem Liggett\u2019s outstanding applications to be sufficient to support determinations of substantial equivalence for the products covered by these substantial equivalence reports. It is possible that FDA could determine that some, or all, of these products are \u201cnot substantially equivalent\u201d to a preexisting tobacco product, as the agency has already done for 20 of Liggett\u2019s applications. NSE orders for other cigarette styles may require us to stop the sale of the applicable cigarettes and other cigarette styles and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOn March 18, 2020, FDA issued a final rule to require new health warnings on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertisements. This rule requires each cigarette package and advertisement to bear one of eleven textual warning statements accompanied by a corresponding graphic image covering 50% of the area of the front and rear panels of cigarette packages and at least 20% of the area at the top of cigarette advertisements. The rule establishes marketing requirements that include the random and equal display and distribution of the required warnings for cigarette packages and quarterly rotation of the required warnings for cigarette advertisements. The final rule provided for an effective date of June 18, 2021, 15 months after issuance of the final rule. On April 3, 2020, Liggett, along with other tobacco companies, commenced an action against the FDA in the United States District Court, District of Texas (Tyler Division) challenging the legality of the graphic warning final rule. On February 10, 2022, the court granted a motion to postpone the effective date of the final rule to April 9, 2023. We cannot predict whether the court will further postpone the effective date and/or determine that some or all of the proposed textual and/or graphic warnings, or proposed prominence of the warnings, violate the First Amendment, Administrative Procedure Act, or other legal requirements, or what the impact of such a court ruling would have on the compliance timeline or requirements imposed on industry.\nIt is likely that the TCA and further regulatory efforts by FDA could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the United States, including sales of Liggett\u2019s and Vector Tobacco\u2019s brands. Compliance and related costs are not possible to predict and depend substantially on the future requirements imposed by FDA under the law. Costs, however, could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the companies\u2019 financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, FDA has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it. Failure to comply with the law and with FDA regulatory requirements could result in significant financial penalties and could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operation of both Liggett and Vector Tobacco. At present, we are not able to predict whether the law will impact Liggett and Vector Tobacco to a greater degree than other companies in the industry, thus affecting our competitive position.\nCertain states may attempt to pass minimum price legislation.\nIn 2020, voters in the state of Colorado approved Proposition EE, increasing taxes on cigarettes, tobacco and nicotine products. In addition to raising the Colorado state excise tax on cigarettes, Proposition EE included a provision that fixed the minimum retail price of cigarettes in Colorado at $7.00 per pack as of January 1, 2021, and thus reduced the competitive advantage of our Company\u2019s discount priced cigarettes in the Colorado marketplace. Although no other state has adopted a fixed minimum retail price law, other states may attempt to do so if the minimum price provision in Proposition EE is determined by the courts to be legal. In the event that other states pass similar legislation that withstands judicial scrutiny, the result could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLitigation will continue to harm the tobacco industry, including Liggett.\nLiggett could be subjected to substantial liabilities and bonding requirements from litigation relating to cigarette products. Adverse judgments could have a negative impact on our ability to operate due to their impact on cash flows. We and our Liggett subsidiary, as well as the entire cigarette industry, continue to be challenged on numerous fronts. New cases continue to be commenced against Liggett and other cigarette manufacturers. As of December 31, 2021, there were 79 individual product liability lawsuits, two purported class actions and one health care cost recovery action pending in the United States in which Liggett and/or we were named defendants. It is likely that similar legal actions, proceedings and claims will continue to be filed against Liggett. Punitive damages, often in amounts ranging into the billions of dollars, are specifically pleaded in certain cases, in addition to compensatory and other damages. It is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases including the certification of additional class actions. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related\nlitigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in any tobacco-related litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Liggett could face difficulties in obtaining a bond to stay execution of a judgment pending appeal. As new product liability cases are commenced against Liggett, the costs associated with defending these cases and the risks relating to the inherent unpredictability of litigation continue to increase.\nIndividual tobacco-related cases resulting from the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Engle could continue to harm Liggett.\nIn May 1994, the Engle case was filed as a class action against Liggett and others in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The class consisted of all Florida residents who, by November 21, 1996, \u201chave suffered, presently suffer or have died from diseases and medical conditions caused by their addiction to cigarette smoking.\u201d A trial was held and the jury returned a verdict adverse to the defendants (approximately $145.0 billion in punitive damages, including $790.0 million against Liggett). Following an appeal to the Third District Court of Appeal, the Florida Supreme Court in July 2006 decertified the class on a prospective basis and affirmed the appellate court\u2019s reversal of the punitive damages award. Former class members had until January 2008 to file individual lawsuits. As a result, we and Liggett, and other cigarette manufacturers, were sued in thousands of Engle progeny cases in both federal and state courts in Florida. Although we were not named as a defendant in the Engle case, we were named as a defendant in substantially all of the Engle progeny cases where Liggett was named as a defendant. Notwithstanding Liggett\u2019s multi-plaintiff settlements, Liggett and Vector Group remain defendants in 28 state court Engle progeny cases. The costs associated with defending these cases continue to negatively impact our cash flows. We cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements and judgments, including cash required to bond any appeals, and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met.\nLiggett may have additional payment obligations under the MSA.\nNPM Adjustment. In March 2006, an economic consulting firm selected pursuant to the MSA determined that the MSA was a \u201csignificant factor contributing to\u201d the loss of market share of Participating Manufacturers for 2003. This same determination has been made for additional years. This is known as the \u201cNPM Adjustment.\u201d As a result, the Participating Manufacturers may be entitled to potential NPM Adjustments to their MSA payments.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Participating Manufacturers had entered into agreements with 38 Settling States setting out terms for settlement of the NPM Adjustment and addressing the NPM Adjustment with respect to those states for future years.\nFor 2003 - 2020, Liggett and Vector Tobacco, as applicable, disputed that they owed the Settling States the NPM Adjustments as calculated by the independent auditor. As permitted by the MSA, Liggett and Vector Tobacco paid subject to dispute, withheld payment or paid into a disputed payment account the amounts associated with these NPM Adjustments. The arbitration for 2004, for those states that did not enter into the agreement or otherwise settle, has commenced. As of December 31, 2021, Liggett and Vector Tobacco accrued approximately $13.2 million related to disputed amounts withheld from the non-settling states for 2004 - 2010, which may be subject to payment, with interest, if Liggett and Vector Tobacco lose the disputes for those years.\nLiggett may have additional payment obligations under its individual state settlements.\nIn 2004, the Attorneys General of Mississippi and Texas advised Liggett that they believed Liggett had failed to make all required payments under the respective settlement agreements with these states. Liggett believes these allegations are without merit, based, among other things, on the language of the most favored nation provisions of the settlement agreements. No amounts have been accrued in our consolidated financial statements for any additional amounts that may be payable by Liggett under the settlement agreements with Mississippi and Texas.\nIn January 2016, the Attorney General for Mississippi filed a motion in Chancery Court in Jackson County, Mississippi to enforce the March 1996 settlement agreement (the \u201c1996 Agreement\u201d). In April 2017, the Chancery Court ruled that the 1996 Agreement should be enforced and referred the matter to a Special Master for further proceedings to determine the amount of damages, if any, to be awarded.\nIn April 2021, the parties stipulated that the unpaid principal (exclusive of interest) purportedly due from Liggett to Mississippi pursuant to the 1996 Agreement (from inception through 2019) is approximately $16.7 million, subject to Liggett\u2019s right to litigate and/or appeal the enforceability of the 1996 Agreement (and all issues other than the calculation of such principal amount). In September 2019, the Special Master held a hearing regarding Mississippi\u2019s claim for pre- and post-judgment interest. In August 2021, the Special Master issued a final report with proposed findings and recommendations that pre-judgment interest, in the amount of approximately $18.8 million, is due from Liggett from April 2005 - August 3, 2021. On November 18, 2021, a hearing was held on Liggett\u2019s objection to the final report in Mississippi Chancery Court. A ruling is pending. In the event Liggett appeals an adverse judgment, the posting of a bond may be required.\nLiggett may be required to make additional payments to Mississippi and Texas which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Associated with Our New Valley Real Estate Business.\nNew Valley is subject to risks relating to the industries in which it operates.\nThe real estate industry is significantly affected by changes in economic and political conditions as well as real estate markets, which could adversely impact returns on our investments, trigger defaults in project financing, cause cancellations of property sales, reduce the value of our properties or investments and could affect our results of operations and liquidity. The real estate industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions which are beyond our control.\nThese conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, levels of unemployment, consumer confidence and the general economic condition of the United States and the global economy. The real estate market also depends upon the strength of financial institutions, which are sensitive to changes in the general macroeconomic environment. Lack of available credit or lack of confidence in the financial sector could impact the real estate market, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny of the following could be associated with cyclicality in the real estate market by halting or limiting a recovery in the residential and commercial real estate markets, and have an adverse effect on our business by causing periods of lower growth or a decline in the number of home sales and/or property prices which, in turn, could adversely affect our business and financial condition:\n\u2022periods of economic slowdown or recession;\n\u2022rising interest rates;\n\u2022the general availability of mortgage financing;\n\u2022a negative perception of the market for residential and commercial real estate;\n\u2022an increase in the cost of homeowners\u2019 insurance;\n\u2022weak credit markets;\n\u2022a low level of consumer confidence in the economy and/or the real estate market;\n\u2022instability of financial institutions;\n\u2022legislative, tax or regulatory changes that would adversely impact the real estate market, including but not limited to potential reform relating to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other government sponsored entities that provide liquidity to the U.S. housing and mortgage markets, and potential limits on, or elimination of, the deductibility of certain mortgage interest expense and property taxes;\n\u2022adverse changes in economic and general business conditions in the areas we invest;\n\u2022declining demand for real estate;\n\u2022acts of God, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters, or acts or threats of war or terrorism; and/or\n\u2022adverse changes in global, national, regional and local economic and market conditions, particularly in the New York metropolitan area and the other markets where our businesses operate, including those relating to pandemics and health crises, such as the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19).\nReal estate development is a competitive industry, and competitive conditions may adversely affect our results of operations. The real estate development industry is highly competitive. Real estate developers compete not only for buyers, but also for desirable properties, building materials, labor and capital. We compete with other local, regional, national and international real estate asset managers, investors and property developers, which have significant financial resources and experience. Competitive conditions in the real estate development industry could result in: difficulty in acquiring suitable investments in properties at acceptable prices; increased selling incentives; lower sales volumes and prices; lower profit margins; impairments in the value of our investments in real estate developments and other assets; and increased construction costs, delays in construction and increased carry costs. Development projects are subject to special risks including potential increase in costs, changes in market demand, inability to meet deadlines which may delay the timely completion of projects, reliance on contractors who may be unable to perform and the need to obtain various governmental and third party consents.\nIf the market value of our properties or investments decline, our results of operations could be adversely affected by impairments and write-downs. We acquire land and invest in real estate projects in the ordinary course of our business. There\nis an inherent risk that the value of our land and investments may decline after purchase, which also may affect the value of existing properties under construction. The valuation of property is inherently subjective and based on the individual characteristics of each property. The market value of our land and investments in real estate projects depends on general and local real estate market conditions. These conditions can change and thereby subject valuations to uncertainty. Moreover, all valuations are made on the basis of assumptions that may not prove to reflect economic or demographic reality. We may have acquired options on or bought and developed land at a cost we will not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot build and sell the property profitably. In addition, our deposits or investments in deposits for building lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk. If market conditions deteriorate, some of our assets may be subject to impairments and write-down charges which would adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nIf demand for residential or commercial real estate decreases below what was anticipated when we purchased interests in or developed such inventory, profitability may be adversely affected and we may not be able to recover the related costs when selling and building our properties and/or investments. We regularly review the value of our investments and will continue to do so on a periodic basis. Write-downs and impairments in the value of our properties and/or investments may be required, and we may in the future sell properties and/or investments at a loss, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks associated with property acquisitions. We may be unable to finance acquisitions or investments on favorable terms or properties may fail to perform as expected. We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an investment up to standards established for its intended market position. We may also acquire or invest in properties subject to liabilities and with recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. New Valley\u2019s acquisition of real estate investments are subject to several risks including: underestimated operating expenses for a property, possibly making it uneconomical or unprofitable; a property may fail to perform in accordance with expectations, in which case New Valley may sustain lower-than-expected income or need to incur additional expenses for the property; and New Valley may not be able to sell, dispose or refinance the property at a favorable price or terms, or at all, as the case may be; in addition to any potential loss on a sale, New Valley may have no choice but to hold on to the property and continue to incur net operating losses if underperforming for an indefinite period of time, as well as incur continuing tax, environmental and other liabilities. Acquisition agreements will typically contain conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence to our satisfaction or other conditions that are not within our control, which may not be satisfied. Each of these factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends on the availability of suitable real estate investments at acceptable prices and having sufficient liquidity to acquire such investments. Our success in investing in real estate depends in part upon the continued availability of suitable real estate assets at acceptable prices. The availability of properties for investment at favorable prices depends on a number of factors outside of our control, including the risk of competitive over-bidding on real estate assets. Should suitable opportunities become less available, the number of properties we develop and invest in would be reduced, which would reduce revenue and profits. In addition, our ability to make investments will depend upon whether we have sufficient liquidity to fund such purchases and investments.\nIf we, or the entities we invest in, are not able to develop and market our real estate developments successfully or within expected timeframes or at projected pricing, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. Before a property development generates any revenues, material expenditures are incurred to acquire land, obtain development approvals and construct significant portions of project infrastructure, amenities, model offices, showrooms, apartments or homes and sales facilities. It generally takes several years for a real estate development to achieve cumulative positive cash flow. If we, or the entities we invest in, are unable to develop and market our real estate developments successfully or to generate positive cash flows from these operations within expected timeframes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nBecause certain of our assets are illiquid, we may not be able to sell these assets when appropriate or when desired. Large real estate developments like the ones that we retain investments in can be hard to sell, especially if local market conditions are poor. Such illiquidity could limit our ability to diversify our assets promptly in response to changing economic or investment conditions. Additionally, financial difficulties of other property owners resulting in distressed sales could depress real estate values in the markets in which we operate in times of illiquidity. These restrictions reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our assets and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nGuaranty risks; risks of joint ventures. New Valley has a number of real estate-related investments in which other partners hold significant interests. New Valley must seek approval from these other parties for important actions regarding these joint ventures. Since the other parties\u2019 interests may differ from those of New Valley, a deadlock could arise that might impair the ability of the ventures to function. Such a deadlock could significantly harm a venture. Further, our minority interest in these joint ventures means that we may not be able to influence the outcome of any particular project, and our rights to obtain information may be limited to the contractual requirements. As a result, we may not have adequate insight into the financial\ncondition of any of our joint ventures given that we do not oversee their financial reporting or decision making. If our partners face adverse financial conditions, it may impair their ability to fund capital calls or satisfy their share of any guarantees on project financing. In addition, we are typically obligated to execute guarantees or indemnify our partners for guarantees they may execute in connection with the acquisition or construction financing for our projects. The guarantees that we might be obligated to sign include guarantees for environmental liability at a project, improper acts committed by New Valley (otherwise known as a \u201cbad boy\u201d guaranty), as well as carry and completion guarantees for a project. In the event of a default, if a lender were to exercise its rights under these guarantees, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur real estate investments and the real estate market in general could be adversely impacted by changes in the law. Many different laws govern the development of real estate. Changes to laws such as affordable housing, zoning, air rights and others, could adversely impact our real estate projects. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department has recently issued Geographic Targeting Orders that will temporarily require certain United States title insurance companies to identify the natural persons who directly or indirectly beneficially own companies that pay all cash for high-end residential real estate in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City and in Miami-Dade County in Florida. No assurances can be given as to the impact such requirements may have on the continued purchasing of high-end residential properties in Manhattan and Miami-Dade County by such individuals while such requirements are in effect, and no assurances can be given as to the impact such requirements may have in the event they are extended to other markets throughout the country in which New Valley is engaged in high-end residential properties.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 could negatively impact New Valley\u2019s markets. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) places limits on mortgage interest deductions as well as state and local income and property tax deductions. The loss of the use of these deductions may encourage residents of states with high income and property taxes and costs of housing to migrate to states with lower tax rates and housing costs. In 2021, approximately 25% of New Valley\u2019s investments are located in New York and California, and a migration of residents from these markets or a reduction in the attractiveness of these markets as a place to live could adversely impact New Valley\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe real estate developments we invest in may be subject to losses as a result of construction defects. Real estate developers are subject to construction defect and warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of their business. These claims are common in the real estate development industry and can be costly.\nClaims may be asserted against the real estate developments we invest in for construction defects, personal injury or property damage caused by the developer, general contractor or subcontractors, and if successful, these claims may give rise to liability. Subcontractors are independent of the homebuilders that contract with them under normal management practices and the terms of trade contracts and subcontracts within the industry; however, if U.S. or other regulatory agencies or courts reclassify the employees of sub-contractors as employees of real estate developers, real estate developers using subcontractors could be responsible for wage, hour and other employment-related liabilities of their subcontractors.\nIn addition, where the real estate developments in which we invest hire general contractors, unforeseen events such as the bankruptcy of, or an uninsured or under-insured loss claimed against, the general contractor may sometimes result in the real estate developer becoming responsible for the losses or other obligations of the general contractor. The costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high, and the amount of coverage offered by insurance companies may be limited. There can be no assurance that this coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly. If the real estate developments in our real estate portfolio are not able to obtain adequate insurance against these claims in the future, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIncreasingly in recent years, individual and class action lawsuits have been filed against real estate developers asserting claims of personal injury and property damage caused by a variety of issues, including faulty materials and the presence of mold in residential dwellings. Furthermore, decreases in home values as a result of general economic conditions may result in an increase in both non-meritorious and meritorious construction defect claims, as well as claims based on marketing and sales practices. Insurance may not cover all of the claims arising from such issues, or such coverage may become prohibitively expensive. If real estate developments in our real estate portfolio are not able to obtain adequate insurance against these claims, they may experience litigation costs and losses that could reduce our revenues from these investments. Even if they are successful in defending such claims, we may incur significant losses.\nOur real estate investments may face substantial damages as a result of existing or future litigation, arbitration or other claims. The real estate developments we invest in are exposed to potentially significant litigation, arbitration proceedings and other claims, including breach of contract, contractual disputes and disputes relating to defective title, property misdescription or construction defects. Class action lawsuits can be costly to defend, and if our assets were to lose any certified class action suit, it could result in substantial liability. With respect to certain general liability exposures, including construction defect and product liability claims, interpretation of underlying current and future trends, assessment of claims and the related liability and reserve estimation process requires us to exercise significant judgment due to the complex nature of these exposures, with each exposure exhibiting unique circumstances. Furthermore, once claims are asserted for construction defects, it is difficult to determine the extent to which the assertion of these claims will expand geographically. As a result, we may suffer losses on our investments which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investments in real estate are susceptible to adverse weather conditions and natural and man-made disasters. Adverse weather conditions and natural and man-made disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, storms, earthquakes, floods, droughts, fires, snow, blizzards, as well as terrorist attacks, riots and electrical outages, can have a significant effect on the assets in our real estate portfolio. The severity and frequency of these adverse weather conditions are worsened by the effects of climate change. These adverse conditions can cause physical damage to work in progress and new developments, delays and increased costs in the construction of new developments and disruptions and suspensions of operations, whether caused directly or by disrupting or suspending operations of those upon whom our real estate developments rely in their operations. Such adverse conditions can mutually cause or aggravate each other, and their incidence and severity are unpredictable. If insurance is unavailable to the real estate developments we invest in or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or if insurance is not adequate to cover business interruptions or losses resulting from adverse weather or natural or man-made disasters, the real estate developments we invest in and our results of operations will be adversely affected. In addition, damage to properties in our real estate portfolio caused by adverse weather or a natural or man-made disaster may cause insurance costs for these properties to increase.\nA major health and safety incident relating to our real estate investments could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage. Building sites are inherently dangerous, and operating in the real estate development industry poses certain inherent health and safety risks. Due to regulatory requirements, health and safety performance is critical to the success of our real estate investments. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities incurred as a result. Such a failure could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on the reputation and relationships of the developer with relevant regulatory agencies or governmental authorities, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our investment and operating results.\nInsurance may not cover some potential losses or may not be obtainable at commercially reasonable rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Real estate properties in our real estate portfolio maintain insurance on their properties in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are comparable with what owners of similar properties carry; however, such insurance may not cover some potential losses or may not be obtainable at commercially reasonable rates in the future. There also are certain types of risks (such as war, environmental contamination such as toxic mold, and lease and other contract claims) which are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. Should any uninsured or underinsured loss occur, we could lose our investment in, and anticipated profits and cash flows from, one or more properties.\nThe volatility in the capital and credit markets has increased in recent years. Because the volatility in capital and credit markets may create additional risks in the upcoming months and possibly years, we will continue to perform additional assessments to determine the impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements. Thus, future impairment charges may occur.\nRisks Relating to the Spin-Off\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from our spin-off from Douglas Elliman\nOn December 29, 2021, we completed the spin-off of Douglas Elliman, which included the real estate services and PropTech investment business formerly owned by Vector Group. Although we believe that the spin-off will enhance our long-term value, we may not be able to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits from the separation of our businesses, and the spin-off may adversely affect our business. Separating the businesses resulted in two independent, publicly traded companies, each of which is now a smaller, less diversified and more narrowly focused business than before the spin-off, which makes us more vulnerable to changing market and economic conditions and the risk of takeover by third parties. Operating as a smaller, independent entity may reduce or eliminate some of the benefits and synergies which previously existed across our business platforms before the spin-off, including our operating diversity, borrowing leverage, available capital for investments, partnerships and relationships and opportunities to pursue integrated strategies with the businesses within our former combined company and the ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees. In addition, as a smaller company, our ability to absorb\ncosts may be negatively impacted, including the significant cost of the spin-off transaction, and we may be unable to obtain financing or refinance our existing indebtedness. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, business prospects and the trading price of our common stock. By spinning off Douglas Elliman, we also may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would be if we did not spin off Douglas Elliman. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the spin-off, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIn connection with the spin-off, we agreed to indemnify Douglas Elliman and Douglas Elliman agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and if we are required to perform under these indemnities or if Douglas Elliman is unable to satisfy its obligations under these indemnities, our financial results could be negatively affected.\nIn connection with the Transition Services Agreement, we and Douglas Elliman, as parties receiving services under the agreement, agreed to indemnify the party providing services for losses incurred by such party that arise out of or are otherwise in connection with the provision by such party of services under the agreement, except to the extent that such losses result from the providing party\u2019s gross negligence, willful misconduct or breach of its obligations under the agreement. Similarly, each party providing services under the agreement will agree to indemnify the party receiving services for losses incurred by such party that arise out of or are otherwise in connection with the indemnifying party\u2019s provision of services under the agreement if such losses result from the providing party\u2019s gross negligence, willful misconduct or breach of its obligations under the agreement.\nIn connection with our tobacco business, from time to time Douglas Elliman may be named as a defendant in tobacco-related lawsuits, notwithstanding the completion of the spin-off. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement we entered into with Douglas Elliman in connection with the spin-off, we and each of our subsidiaries agreed to indemnify Douglas Elliman for liabilities related to our tobacco business, including liabilities that Douglas Elliman may incur for tobacco-related litigation. While we do not believe that Douglas Elliman has any liability for tobacco-related claims, an adverse decision in a tobacco-related lawsuit against Douglas Elliman could, if the indemnification is deemed for any reason to be unenforceable or any amounts owed to Douglas Elliman thereunder are not collectible, in whole or in part, have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn connection with the spin-off, Douglas Elliman provided us with indemnities with respect to liabilities arising out of Douglas Elliman\u2019s business. If we are subject to an adverse decision in a lawsuit related to Douglas Elliman\u2019s business, and Douglas Elliman fails to satisfy its obligations, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe spin-off and related transactions may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.\nThe spin-off could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor could claim that we did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the spin-off, and that the spin-off left us insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that we intended or believed we would incur debts beyond our ability to pay such debts as they mature. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the spin-off as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, including without limitation, returning the assets or the shares of common stock in Douglas Elliman being distributed as part of the spin-off or providing us with a claim for money damages against the spun-off business in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by us and the fair market value of Douglas Elliman at the time of the spin-off.\nCertain directors who serve on our Board of Directors currently serve as directors of Douglas Elliman following the spin-off, and ownership of shares of common stock of Douglas Elliman following the spin-off by our directors and executive officers may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest.\nCertain of our directors who serve on our Board of Directors currently serve on the board of directors of Douglas Elliman. This may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest when our or Douglas Elliman's management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for us and Douglas Elliman, including the resolution of any dispute regarding the terms of the agreements governing the spin-off and the relationship between us and Douglas Elliman after the spin-off or any other commercial agreements entered into in the future between us and Douglas Elliman. For example, in the past, subsidiaries of Douglas Elliman have been engaged by certain developers as the sole broker or the co-broker for several of the real estate development projects that New Valley owns an interest in through its real estate venture investments. Douglas Elliman had gross commissions of approximately $9.0 million, $10.8 million and $19.0 million from these projects for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIn addition, all of our executive officers and some of our non-employee directors currently own shares of the common stock of Douglas Elliman. The continued ownership of such common stock by our directors and executive officers following the spin-off creates or may create the appearance of a conflict of interest when these directors and executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and Douglas Elliman\nAfter the spin-off, certain of our executive officers will not devote their full time to Vector Group\u2019s affairs, and the overlap may give rise to conflicts.\nOur Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer and General Counsel serve in the same roles at Douglas Elliman. This management model has and continues to use holding company executives to focus on public company matters while delegating the operations of our subsidiaries, including Liggett, to experienced operating professionals and we believe it has created stockholder value. Nonetheless, our management team divides its time between Vector Group and Douglas Elliman and consequently, does not spend its full time on our business. From time to time, our overlapping executive officers may be required to spend a significant portion of their time and attention on Douglas Elliman\u2019s affairs, and there can be no assurance that they will be able to devote sufficient time to the Company\u2019s affairs.\nOur overlapping executive officers may also face actual or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting each company. For example, the potential for a conflict of interest may arise when we, on the one hand, and Douglas Elliman, on the other hand, consider corporate opportunities that may be suitable for both companies.\nIf the distribution, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of l986, as amended (\u201cCode\u201d), then our stockholders, we and Douglas Elliman might be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes.\nThe distribution was conditioned upon our receipt of an opinion of our spin-off tax advisor to the effect that, subject to the assumptions and limitations described therein, the distribution of Douglas Elliman common stock to holders of our common stock (such distribution, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the distribution of Douglas Elliman common stock with respect to our stock option awards and restricted stock awards), together with certain related transactions, will qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code in which no gain or loss is recognized by us or our stockholders, except, in the case of our stockholders, for cash received in lieu of fractional shares. The opinion of our spin-off tax advisor was based on, among other things, certain assumptions as well as on the continuing accuracy of certain factual representations and statements that we and Douglas Elliman made to the spin-off tax advisor. In rendering its opinion, the spin-off tax advisor also relied on certain covenants that we and Douglas Elliman entered into, including the adherence by us and by Douglas Elliman to certain restrictions on future actions contained in the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement. If any of the representations or statements that we or Douglas Elliman made are or become inaccurate or incomplete, or if we or Douglas Elliman breach any of such covenants, the spin-off and such related transactions might not qualify for such tax treatment. The opinion of the spin-off tax advisor is not binding on the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) or a court, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the validity of the spin-off and such related transactions as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code eligible for tax-free treatment, or that any such challenge ultimately will not prevail.\nIf the spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction for any reason, including as a result of a breach of a representation or covenant, we would recognize a substantial gain attributable to Douglas Elliman for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Additionally, if the spin-off does not qualify as tax-free under Section 355 of the Code, our stockholders will be treated as having received a distribution equal to the fair market value of the stock distributed, which generally would be treated first as a taxable dividend to the extent of such holder\u2019s pro rata share of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, then as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such holder\u2019s tax basis in our common stock, and thereafter as capital gain with respect to any remaining value.\nWe are subject to continuing contingent tax-related liabilities of Douglas Elliman following the spin-off.\nAfter the spin-off, there are several significant areas where the liabilities of Douglas Elliman may become our obligations, either in whole or in part. For example, to the extent that any subsidiary of ours was included in the consolidated tax reporting group of Vector Group for any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the spin-off, such subsidiary is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group of Vector Group, as applicable, for such taxable period. In connection with the spin-off, we have entered into a Tax Disaffiliation Agreement with Douglas Elliman, that allocates the responsibility for prior period consolidated taxes to Vector Group. If we are unable to pay any prior period taxes for which we are responsible, however, Douglas Elliman could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes, and such amounts could be significant. Other provisions of federal, state or local law may establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities.\nOur ability to engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions is subject to limitations because we have agreed to certain restrictions intended to support the tax-free nature of the spin-off.\nThe U.S. federal income tax laws that apply to transactions like the spin-off generally create a presumption that the spin-off would be taxable to us (but not to our stockholders) if we engage in, or enter into an agreement to engage in, an acquisition\nof all or a significant portion of our common stock beginning two years before the distribution date, unless it is established that the transaction is not pursuant to a plan or series or transactions related to the spin-off. U.S. Treasury regulations currently in effect generally provide that whether an acquisition transaction and a distribution are part of a plan is determined based on all of the facts and circumstances, including specific factors listed in the Treasury regulations. In addition, these Treasury regulations provide several \"safe harbors\" for acquisition transactions that are not considered to be part of a plan that includes a distribution.\nThere are other restrictions imposed on us under current U.S. federal income tax laws with which we will need to comply in order for the spin-off and certain related transactions to qualify as a transaction that is tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. For example, we will generally be required to continue to own and manage our business, and there will be limitations on issuances, redemptions and sales of our stock for cash or other property following the spin-off, except in connection with certain stock-for-stock acquisitions and other permitted transactions. If these restrictions are not followed, the spin-off could be taxable to us and our stockholders.\nWe entered into a Tax Disaffiliation Agreement with Douglas Elliman under which we have allocated, between Douglas Elliman and ourselves, responsibility for U.S. federal as well as state and local income and other taxes relating to taxable periods before and after the spin-off and provided for computing and apportioning tax liabilities and tax benefits between the parties. In the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, we agreed that, among other things, we may not take, or fail to take, any action following the spin-off if such action, or failure to act: would be inconsistent with or prohibit the spin-off and certain related transactions from qualifying as a tax-free reorganization under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 and related provisions of the Code to us and our stockholders (except with respect to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares of our stock).\nIn addition, we agreed that we may not, among other things, during the two-year period following the spin-off, except under certain specified circumstances, (i) redeem or otherwise repurchase our stock; (ii) liquidate, merge or consolidate with another person; (iii) sell or otherwise dispose of assets outside the ordinary course of business or materially change the manner of operating our business; or (iv) take any other action or actions that in the aggregate would have the effect that one or more persons acquire (or have the right to acquire), directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions, 35% of our stock. These restrictions could limit our strategic and operational flexibility, including our ability to finance our operations by issuing equity securities, make acquisitions using equity securities, repurchase our equity securities, or raise money by selling assets or enter into business combination transactions. We also agreed to indemnify Douglas Elliman for certain tax liabilities resulting from any such transactions. Further, our stockholders may consider these covenants and indemnity obligations unfavorable as they might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nWe and our subsidiaries have a substantial amount of indebtedness and liquidity commitments.\nWe and our subsidiaries have significant indebtedness and debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2021, we and our subsidiaries had total outstanding indebtedness of $1.43 billion. In addition, subject to the terms of any future agreements, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. There is a risk that we will not be able to generate sufficient funds to repay our debt. If we cannot service our fixed charges, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have significant liquidity commitments.\nDuring 2022, we will have significant liquidity commitments that will require the use of our existing cash resources. As of December 31, 2021, our corporate expenditures (exclusive of Liggett, Vector Tobacco and New Valley) and other potential liquidity requirements over the next 12 months include the following:\n\u2022cash interest expense of approximately $108.6 million,\n\u2022dividends of approximately $127.5 million based on the assumed quarterly cash dividend rate of $0.20 per share and assuming 158,720,996 shares outstanding (153,959,427 common shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 4,761,569 employee stock options with dividend equivalent rights), and\n\u2022other corporate expenses and taxes.\nIn order to meet the above liquidity requirements as well as other liquidity needs in the normal course of business, we will be required to use cash flows from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents. Should these resources be insufficient to meet the upcoming liquidity needs, we may also be required to liquidate investment securities available for sale and other long-term investments, or, if available, draw on the Liggett Credit Facility. While there are actions we can take to reduce our liquidity needs, there can be no assurance that such measures will be successful.\nServicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and we may not generate sufficient cash flow from our businesses to pay our substantial indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and regulatory factors, as well as other factors beyond our control. The cash flow from operations in the future may be insufficient to service our indebtedness because of factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate the necessary cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nOur high level of debt may adversely affect our ability to satisfy our obligations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations. A default in our debt obligations, including a breach of any restrictive covenant imposed by the terms of our indebtedness, could result in the acceleration of the affected debt as well as other of our indebtedness. In such a situation, it is unlikely that we would be able to fulfill our obligations under the debt or such other indebtedness or that we would otherwise be able to repay the accelerated indebtedness or make other required payments. Even in the absence of an acceleration of our indebtedness, a default under the terms of our indebtedness could have an adverse impact on our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and on the trading price of our debt and our common stock.\nOur high level of indebtedness, as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets, could have important consequences. For example, they could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our other obligations with respect to our debt, including repurchase obligations, upon the occurrence of specified change of control events;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, reducing the amount of our cash flow available for dividends on our common stock and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022require us to sell other securities or to sell some or all of our assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;\n\u2022restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, investing in new capital assets or taking advantage of business opportunities;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt.\nOur 5.75% Senior Secured Notes, 10.5% Senior Notes, and Liggett Credit Facility contain restrictive covenants, and the Liggett Credit Facility contains financial ratios, that limit our operating flexibility, and may limit our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nThe indenture governing our 5.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the \u201c2029 Indenture\u201d), the indenture governing our 10.5% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201c2026 Indenture\u201d) and the Liggett Credit Facility contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to take specific actions, even if we believe them to be in our best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;\n\u2022pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock or subordinated indebtedness, or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022create or incur liens with respect to our assets;\n\u2022make investments, loans or advances;\n\u2022incur dividend or other payment restrictions;\n\u2022prepay subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022merge, consolidate, reorganize or sell our assets, or use asset sale proceeds.\nOur ability to comply with the provisions of the 2029 Indenture, the 2026 Indenture, and the Liggett Credit Facility may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance, changes in general business and economic conditions, adverse regulatory developments or other events beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our indebtedness, which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable. If any of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay it. See Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for details of debt covenant compliance.\nChanges in respect of the debt ratings of our notes may materially and adversely affect the availability, the cost and the terms and conditions of our debt.\nBoth we and several issues of our notes have been publicly rated by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc., and Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services, independent rating agencies. In addition, future debt instruments may be publicly rated. These debt ratings may affect our ability to raise debt. Any future downgrading of the notes or our other debt by Moody\u2019s or S&P may affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the notes.\nThe Tax Act may increase the after-tax cost of debt financings.\nThe Tax Ac limits our interest expense deduction to 30% of taxable income before interest, depreciation and amortization in 2018 and 2021 and 50% of taxable income before interest, depreciation, and amortization in 2019 and 2020 (as a result of provisions contained in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (\u201cCARES\u201d) Act, and then 30% of taxable income before interest thereafter for non-excepted trade or businesses. One such excepted trade or business is any electing real property trade or business, of which portions of our New Valley real estate business may qualify. Interest expense allocable to an excepted trade or business is not subject to limitation. The Tax Act permits us to carry forward disallowed interest expense indefinitely. Although all of our interest expense was deductible prior to the spin-off, due to our high degree of leverage, a portion of our interest expense in future years may not be deductible, which may increase the after tax cost of any new debt financings as well as the refinancing of our existing debt. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the nondeductible interest on our operations and capital structure.\nRisks Relating to Our Structure and Other Business Risks\nWe are a holding company and depend on cash payments from our subsidiaries, which are subject to contractual and other restrictions, in order to service our debt and to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe are a holding company and have no operations of our own. We hold our interests in our various businesses through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, VGR Holding LLC (\u201cVGR Holding\u201d) and New Valley. In addition to our own cash resources, our ability to pay interest on our debt and to pay dividends on our common stock depends on the ability of VGR Holding and New Valley to make cash available to us. VGR Holding\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us depends primarily on the ability of Liggett and Vector Tobacco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, to generate cash and make it available to VGR Holding. The Liggett Credit Facility contains a restricted payments test that limits the ability of Liggett to pay cash dividends to VGR Holding. The ability of Liggett to meet the restricted payments test may be affected by factors beyond its control.\nOur receipt of cash payments, as dividends or otherwise, from our subsidiaries is an important source of our liquidity and capital resources. If we do not have sufficient cash resources of our own and do not receive payments from our subsidiaries in an amount sufficient to repay our debts and to pay dividends on our common stock, we must obtain additional funds from other sources. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain additional funds at all or on terms acceptable to us. Our inability to service these obligations and to continue to pay dividends on our common stock would significantly harm us and the value of our notes and our common stock.\nMaintaining the integrity of our computer systems and protecting confidential information and personal identifying information has become increasingly costly, as cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts that gain unauthorized access to information technology systems both internally and externally, to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at us and our stakeholders. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property, and personally identifiable information of our tobacco customers. Additionally, we increasingly rely on third-party providers, including cloud storage solution providers. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations and with respect to information collected and stored by our third-party service providers, we are reliant upon their security procedures.\nOur systems and the confidential information on them may also be compromised by employee misconduct or employee error. We and our third-party service providers have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of internal and external threats and incidents, which can result, and have resulted, in the misappropriation and unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own and that of third parties, including personally identifiable information) and the disruption of business operations. For example, in April 2021, we determined that an unauthorized party gained access to the IT network of Douglas Elliman Property Management, a subsidiary of our former subsidiary, Douglas Elliman, and temporarily disrupted business operations and obtained certain files that contained personally identifiable information pertaining to owners and others in buildings managed by, and employees of, DEPM. The former subsidiary also took steps to secure its systems, contacted law enforcement, conducted an investigation and enhanced its security protocols to help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future. Depending on their nature and scope, these incidents could potentially also result in the destruction or corruption of such data and information. Our business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of the services we provide to our customers, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. Developments in the laws and regulations governing the handling and transmission of personal identifying information in the United States may require us to devote more resources to protecting such information, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our key personnel.\nWe depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel as our named executive officers have been employed by us for an average of 27 years at December 31, 2021. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our operations. Please see the Risk Factor, \u201cAfter the spin-off, our management team does not devote its full time to Vector Group\u2019s Affairs.\u201d\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect us.\nThe accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, the implementation of which requires significant management attention. Internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations. These limitations include, among others, the possibility of human error, inadequacy or circumvention of controls and fraud. If we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or design and implement controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements, including in connection with controls executed for us by third parties, we might fail to timely detect any misappropriation of corporate assets or inappropriate allocation or use of funds and could be unable to file accurate financial reports on a timely basis. As a result, our reputation, results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe trading price of our common stock has ranged between $8.76 and $12.43 per share over the past 52 weeks.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022the operating and stock performance of our competitors;\n\u2022our dividend payment ratio and level;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services or significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022the initiation or outcome of litigation;\n\u2022the failure or significant disruption of our operations from various causes related to our critical information technologies and systems including cybersecurity threats to our data and customer data as well as reputational or financial risks associated with a loss of any such data;\n\u2022changes in interest rates;\n\u2022general economic, market and political conditions;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022future sales of our equity or convertible securities.\nWe cannot predict the extent, if any, to which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale, may depress the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Furthermore, stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our stock drops significantly, which may cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management. These factors, among others, could significantly depress the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 75233, "SIC": 6531, "TIC": "VGR"}
