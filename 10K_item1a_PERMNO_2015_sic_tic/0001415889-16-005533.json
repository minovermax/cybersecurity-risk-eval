{"cik": "1613011", "company": "Code Rebel Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-04-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the information set forth at the beginning of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis entitled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information,\u201d investors should consider that there are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our goals. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operation may be materially and adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nWe have a limited operating history and therefore we cannot ensure the long-term successful operation of our business, and the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by a small developing technology company.\nWe were initially formed as a limited liability company in Hawaii in April 2007, and subsequently incorporated in Delaware in May 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we had revenue of $526,399, $223,453 and $146,763, respectively, and net losses of $3,590,591, $679,942 and $579,587, respectively. No assurance can be given that we will ever have significant levels of revenue or net income. Accordingly, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by growing technology companies in new and rapidly evolving markets, such as the terminal services, virtualization and digital media software markets in which we operate. We must meet many challenges including:\n\u00b7\nestablishing and maintaining broad market acceptance of our products and services and converting that acceptance into direct and indirect sources of revenue,\n\u00b7\nestablishing and maintaining adoption of our technology on a wide variety of platforms and devices,\n\u00b7\ntimely and successfully developing new products, product features and services and increasing the functionality and features of existing products and services,\n\u00b7\ndeveloping services and products that result in high degrees of corporate client satisfaction and high levels of end-customer usage,\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully responding to competition, including competition from emerging technologies and solutions,\n\u00b7\ndeveloping and maintaining strategic relationships to enhance the distribution, features, content and utility of our products and services and\n\u00b7\nidentifying, attracting and retaining talented technical and creative services staff at reasonable market compensation rates in the markets in which we employ.\nOur business strategy may be unsuccessful and we may be unable to address the risks we face in a cost-effective manner, if at all. We cannot assure you that our business will be profitable or that we will ever generate sufficient revenue to meet our operating expenses and support our anticipated business activities.\nWe have a history of losses, we expect to continue to incur losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred losses in each fiscal year since 2013, including fiscal year 2015. These losses were mainly due to the investments we made, and continue to make, to build, grow and maintain our business and acquire customers and other businesses. Developing our products is expensive. Our investment in product development may not result in marketable products or may result in products that take longer to generate revenue, or may generate less revenue, than we anticipate. Key elements of our growth strategy include (1) acquiring or investing in businesses, products and technologies; (2) penetrating the business to consumer (\u201cB2C\u201d) market for the growing number of consumers using MAC laptop computers, iPads and mobile devices; (3) and continuing to expand our cloud iRAPP terminal services and client products business; and (4) acquiring and developing other product lines and services. As set forth, we cannot predict our revenue growth, and you should not rely upon our revenue performance in prior fiscal years as indicative of our future performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will reach profitability in the future or at any specific time in the future or that, if and when we do become profitable, we will sustain profitability. If we are ultimately unable to meet our financial targets to create sufficient revenue to become profitable and have sustainable positive cash flows, investors could lose all or part of their investment.\nWe are dependent on Bump Networks technical employees and administrative personnel, and the loss of key personnel of Bump Networks may impact our ability to develop and maintain our iRAPP software solution and could prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had four full-time employees. Substantially all of our administrative, management and technical support is provided through the efforts of personnel and contractors employed or engaged by Bump Networks. Since these services are provided to us by Bump Networks at the actual cost incurred by Bump Networks, the termination of such services, particularly on short notice, would materially and adversely affect our business operations. Our agreement with Bump Networks may be terminated upon thirty days\u2019 notice and our obligations to Mr. Kryeziu as a director and officer will continue after any such termination.\nWe are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our key development personnel, including consultants for Bump Networks, for product innovation and timely development and delivery of upgrades and enhancements to our existing products. The market for expert software developers upon whom we rely has become increasingly competitive. We generally do not have employment or non-competition agreements with our development personnel, and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty and could pursue employment opportunities with any of our competitors. Changes to management can also lead to additional unplanned losses of key personnel. The loss of key personnel could seriously harm our ability to release new products on a timely basis and could significantly help our competitors.\nWe may not successfully integrate the businesses of our recent ThinOps acquisition or our proposed merger with Aegis to realize the full benefits of the combined businesses.\nOur recent acquisition of ThinOps and the proposed merger with Aegis involves the integration of businesses that have previously operated separately. The difficulties of combining the operations of these businesses include:\n\u00b7\nthe challenge of effecting technical integration while carrying on our ongoing businesses;\n\u00b7\nthe necessity of coordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u00b7\neffective integration of personnel with diverse business backgrounds; and\n\u00b7\nraising additional capital or sources of funds to invest in these businesses.\nThe process of completing the integration of these businesses could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our company and the loss of key personnel. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the acquisition and the integration of ThinOps\u2019 operations or the merger and integration of Aegis\u2019 operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our proposed acquisition of Aegis will result in the change in the majority of our directors and almost all of our executive officers. Any integration and development of the Aegis business will be by officers and directors that have not been part of our company and we could deploy funds and resources to the development and funding of the Aegis businesses to the detriment of our current businesses.\nIf businesses do not find our terminal services solutions compelling, our revenue growth and operating margins will suffer.\nWe provide terminal services and remote access solutions. As the market for remote access and virtualization services has matured, we have increasingly directed our product development and marketing toward products and services that enable businesses to utilize terminal services and virtualization as the foundation for cloud-based computing, management and automation of the delivery of IT resources and end-user computing. We are also investing in the development of products and services for the emerging platform as a service, or \u201cPaaS,\u201d and software as a service, or \u201cSaaS,\u201d markets. Our success depends on enterprise and commercial businesses and government agencies, as well as individual customers, perceiving technological and operational benefits and cost savings associated with the increasing adoption of virtualization-based infrastructure and management solutions for cloud computing, application development and end-user computing. In addition, to the extent that our terminal services and software solutions are not widely adopted or are accepted more slowly or less comprehensively than we expect, our ability to generate any significant revenues will be materially and adversely affected.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from our terminal services products including our iRAPP product line. Decreases in demand for our virtualization solutions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nTo date, our license revenue has been minimal and has been derived from our cloud iRAPP terminal services solutions. Although we expect that our iRAPP virtualization products and related enhancements and upgrades will achieve market acceptance, our ability to create demand for our products and solutions in the enterprise market could be materially and adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nimproved products or product versions being offered by competitors in our markets;\n\u00b7\ncompetitive pricing pressures;\n\u00b7\nfailure to release new or enhanced versions of our virtualization products on a timely basis, or at all;\n\u00b7\ntechnological change that we are unable to address with our virtualization products or that changes the way enterprises utilize our products; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions.\nBecause our terminal services products business segment represents half of one of our two operating and reportable business segments, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would, therefore, be adversely affected by a decline in demand for our iRAPP virtualization products.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from our management and consulting services which are provided through our ThinOps subsidiary which we acquired in July, 2015.\nWe currently offer two groups of IT services: (i) Independent Software Vendor relationships and Professional Services Consulting, which revolve around implementation, upgrades and maintenance of the software packages those ISVs offer to their clients. The consulting services business is subject to significant competition. Our consulting services are may not achieve expectations or projections due to a number of factors, including the scope of services that are offered, the amount of resources that we are able to deploy to this operating segment, competition from other service providers, including those with greater depth of service offerings and complimentary products, our ability to attract and retain employees, including those with marketing and sales experience, and general economic conditions, and our ability to integrate this operating segment into our company and cross-market our ThinOps IT Services and our software products.\nOngoing uncertainty regarding global economic conditions and the stability of regional financial markets may reduce information technology software and technology consulting spending below current expectations and, therefore, adversely impact our revenues, impede end-user adoption of new products and product upgrades, reduce the demand for technology consulting services and adversely impact our competitive position.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for information technology software and technology consulting services and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers. The purchase of our products and services is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources. Weak economic conditions or significant uncertainty regarding the stability of financial markets could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways, including by lengthening sales cycles, affecting the size of enterprise license agreements (\u201cELAs\u201d) that customers will commit to, reducing the level of our non-ELA transactional sales, lowering prices for our products and services, reducing demand for technology consulting services, reducing share sales and reducing the rate of adoption of our products by new customers and the willingness of current customers to purchase upgrades to our existing products. In response to sustained economic uncertainty, many national and local governments that are current or prospective customers for our products and services, including the U.S. federal government, have also made, or announced plans to make, significant spending cutbacks, which could reduce the amount of government spending on information technology and consulting services and the potential demand for our products and services from the government sector.\nOngoing economic uncertainty has also resulted in general and ongoing tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy and significant volatility in the credit, equity and fixed income markets. As a result, current or potential customers may be unable to fund software purchases or consulting services, which could cause them to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services. Even if customers are willing to purchase our products and services, if they do not meet our credit requirements, we may not be able to record accounts receivable or unearned revenue or recognize revenues from these customers until we receive payment, which could adversely affect the amount of revenues we are able to recognize in a particular period.\nWe currently face and continue to expect to face substantial and increasing competition.\nWe face significant competition from many companies such as Microsoft Corp., VMware, Inc., Red Hat, Inc. and Citrix Systems, Inc., all of which are substantially larger, have significantly greater technical and financial resources than we have and are better positioned to continue investment in competitive technologies. These companies and many of our other current or potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we have.\nFor example, Citrix Systems continues to enhance its SaaS, virtualization and remote desktop solutions. International Business Machines Corp., Google Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. have existing cloud computing offerings and announced new cloud computing initiatives. Red Hat has released commercial versions of Linux that have virtualization capabilities as part of the Linux kernel and has also announced plans for cloud computing products. Even though those virtualization solutions are not a part of the terminal services market, any virtualization solution can affect terminal services and remote access market indirectly.\nWe believe the key competitive factors in the virtualization and cloud computing markets include:\n\u00b7\nthe level of reliability, security and new functionality of product offerings;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to provide comprehensive solutions, including management and security capabilities;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to offer products that support multiple hardware platforms, operating systems, applications and application development frameworks;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to deliver an intuitive end-user experience for accessing data, applications and services from a wide variety of end-user devices;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to effectively run traditional IT applications and emerging applications;\n\u00b7\nthe proven track record of formulating and delivering a roadmap of virtualization and cloud computing capabilities;\n\u00b7\npricing of products, individually and in bundles;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to attract and preserve a large installed base of customers;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to attract and preserve a large number of application developers to develop to a given cloud ecosystem;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to create and maintain partnering opportunities with hardware vendors, infrastructure software vendors and cloud service providers;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to develop robust indirect sales channels; and\n\u00b7\nthe ability to attract and retain cloud, virtualization and systems experts as key employees.\nExisting and future competitors may introduce products in the same markets we serve or intend to serve, and competing products may have better performance, lower prices, better functionality and broader acceptance than our products and services. Our competitors may also add features to their virtualization, end-user and cloud computing products similar to features that presently differentiate our product offerings from theirs. This competition could result in increased pricing pressure and sales and marketing expenses, thereby materially reducing our operating margins, and could harm our ability to increase, or cause us to lose, market share. Increased competition also may prevent us from entering into or renewing service contracts on terms similar to those that we currently offer and may cause the length of our sales cycle to increase. Some of our competitors and potential competitors supply a wide variety of products to, and have well-established relationships with, our current and prospective end users. For example, small to medium sized businesses and companies in emerging markets that are evaluating the adoption of virtualization-based technologies and solutions may be inclined to consider Microsoft solutions because of their existing use of Windows and Office products. Some of these competitors have in the past and may in the future take advantage of their existing relationships to engage in business practices that make our products less attractive to our end users.\nOur current product development efforts may not produce significant revenue for several years, if at all.\nDeveloping our products is expensive. Our investment in product development may not result in marketable products or may result in products that take longer to generate revenue, or may generate less revenue, than we anticipate. Our future plans include significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities. We believe we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we may not receive significant revenue from these investments for several years, if at all.\nOur sales are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from quarter to quarter, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly.\nWhile we anticipate licensees of our products to renew support and maintenance subscriptions on at least an annual basis, the timing of new product purchases and support subscriptions are not subject to a typical sales cycle. Accordingly, our revenues are difficult to predict. We expect our future sales and marketing efforts involve and will involve educating our customers about the use and benefit of our products, including their technical capabilities, potential cost savings to an organization and advantages compared to lower-cost products offered by our competitors. In addition, product purchases are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. Moreover, the greater number of competitive alternatives, as well as announcements by our competitors that they intend to introduce competitive alternatives at some point in the future, can lengthen customer procurement cycles, cause us to spend additional time and resources to educate end users on the advantages of our product offerings and delay product sales. Economic downturns and uncertainty can also cause customers to add layers to their internal purchase approval processes, adding further time to a sales cycle. These factors can have an impact on the timing and length of our sales cycles.\nWe may not be able to scale our business quickly enough to meet our customers\u2019 growing needs and, if we are not able to grow efficiently, our operating results could be harmed.\nAs usage of our software grows and as customers use our solutions, we will need to devote additional resources to improving our application architecture, integrating with third-party systems and maintaining infrastructure performance. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business systems and our services organization, including customer support and professional services, to serve our growing customer base, particularly as our customer demographics expand over time. Any failure of or delay in these efforts could cause impaired system performance and reduced customer satisfaction. These issues could reduce the attractiveness of our marketing software to customers, resulting in decreased sales to new customers, lower renewal rates by existing customers, the issuance of service credits, or requested refunds, which could adversely affect our revenue growth and harm our reputation. Even if we are able to upgrade our systems and expand our staff, any such expansion will be expensive and complex, requiring management time and attention. We could also face inefficiencies or operational failures as a result of our efforts to scale our infrastructure. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with upgrading, improving and expanding our information technology systems. We cannot be sure that the expansion and improvements to our infrastructure and systems will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all. These efforts may reduce revenue and our margins and adversely affect our financial results.\nIf we fail to establish our iRAPP brand, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\nWe believe development of our iRAPP brand is critical to achieving widespread awareness of our existing and future infrastructure software solutions and, as a result, is important to attracting new customers and maintaining existing customers. We also believe the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful infrastructure software at competitive prices. In the past, our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expenses. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand. In addition, to sell to and service our customers, we utilize a combination of internal personnel and third-party service providers, as well as indirect sales partners that pursue additional channel, agency and OEM distribution partnerships. These third-party service providers and indirect sales partners, who are not in our control, may harm our reputation and damage our brand perception in the marketplace. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, our business could suffer.\nIf we fail to offer high-quality technical and customer support, our business and reputation may be harmed.\nHigh-quality technical and customer support is important for the successful marketing and sale of our products and for the renewal of existing customers. Providing this education and support requires that our customer support personnel have specific marketing domain knowledge and expertise, making it more difficult for us to hire qualified personnel and to scale up our support operations due to the extensive training required. The importance of high-quality customer support will increase as we expand our business and pursue new customers. If we do not help our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional functionality and services to existing customers may suffer and our reputation with existing or potential customers may be harmed.\nIf we fail to forecast our revenue accurately due to lengthy sales cycles, or if we fail to match our expenditures with corresponding revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe have a very limited history upon which to base forecasts of future revenue. In addition, for our enterprise and commercial customers, the lengthy sales cycle for the evaluation and implementation of our solutions, which typically extends for several months, may also cause us to experience a delay between increasing operating expenses for such sales efforts, and, upon successful sales, the generation of corresponding revenue. Accordingly, we may be unable to prepare accurate internal financial forecasts or replace anticipated revenue that we do not receive as a result of delays arising from these factors. As a result, our operating results in future reporting periods may be significantly below the expectations of the public market, equity research analysts or investors, which could harm the price of our common stock.\nShifts over time in the mix of sizes or types of organizations that purchase our products or changes in the components of our solutions purchased by our customers could negatively affect our operating results.\nOur strategy is to sell our infrastructure software to organizations of broadly different sizes. Our gross margins can vary depending on numerous factors related to the implementation and use of our infrastructure software, including the sophistication and intensity of our customers\u2019 use of our solutions and the level of professional services and support required by a customer. Providing professional services to enterprises allows us to utilize our staff more efficiently than is the case in providing professional services to other customers or in other contexts; consequently, an increase in providing professional services to enterprises could impact our overall gross margin. Sales to enterprise and commercial customers may also entail longer sales cycles and more significant selling efforts. If the mix of organizations that purchase our solutions changes, or our customers change the mix of solution components they purchase, our gross margins could decrease and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to penetrate the business-to-consumer market and additional vertical industries, our revenue may not grow and our operating results may be harmed.\nAn important part of our growth strategy is to penetrate the B2C market for the growing number of consumers using MAC laptop computers, iPads and mobile devices. We have less experience in this market, and our future ability to expand into it may require us to develop additional features for our products, expand our expertise in certain areas, and add sales and support personnel possessing familiarity with this market. In addition, B2C customers may have greater usage requirements which could put pressure on our systems and infrastructure and require us to expand these systems and infrastructure to meet increased demand. As a result of these and other factors, our efforts to expand further into the B2C market and further into additional vertical industries may be expensive, may not succeed and may harm our revenue growth and operating results.\nThe loss of the services of Arben Kryeziu or the failure to attract additional key individuals would materially and adversely affect our business operations and prospects.\nOur financial success is dependent to a significant degree upon the efforts of Arben Kryeziu, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Kryeziu. We intend to amend Mr. Kryeziu\u2019s employment agreement upon the completion of our proposed merger with Aegis and the term of such agreement will be for annual terms and subject to mutual renewal. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that Mr. Kryeziu will continue to provide services to us. A voluntary or involuntary termination of employment could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations if we were not able to attract a qualified replacement for him in a timely manner. At present, we do not maintain a key-man life insurance policy for Mr. Kryeziu and are not in the process of obtaining such insurance.\nArben Kryeziu, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, serves as an officer for other businesses, which may cause conflicts of interest with regard to obtaining business opportunities and the amount of time spent on other activities.\nArben Kryeziu, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, serves as an officer for other businesses, as described in his biography appearing in the \u201cManagement\u201d section below. While we believe our business is distinguishable from those other companies\u2019 activities, and that we do not compete in the markets in which his other activities compete, Mr. Kryeziu may have potential conflicts of interest with respect to potential business opportunities that may become available to him, or to our company and those other activities. Potential conflicts of interest also include the amount of time and effort devoted by him to his other activities. We may be negatively affected if Mr. Kryeziu chooses to place the interests of his other activities before those of our company. Our independent directors are aware of these potential conflicts of interest and are responsible for reviewing and resolving them on a case by case basis whenever they may arise. The failure of our independent directors to resolve any conflicts of interest in favor of our company could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth, and our compensation expenses may increase.\nTo execute on our strategy, we must continue to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for senior sales executives and engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we do. Technical personnel are also aggressively recruited by other startup and emerging growth companies, which are especially active in many of the technical areas and geographic regions in which we conduct product development. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the high-technology industry, job candidates often consider the value of the stock-based compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment. Declines in the value of our common stock could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees and result in increased employee compensation expenses.\nOur success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services, enhance our existing products and services and develop appropriate business and pricing models.\nIf we are unable to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services or enhance and improve our products and support services, in a timely manner, or position or price our products and services to meet market demand, customers may not buy new software licenses from us, update to new versions of our software or renew product support. In addition, IT standards from both consortia and formal standards-setting forums as well as de facto marketplace standards are rapidly evolving. We cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas such as cloud computing.\nNew product development and introduction involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including:\n\u00b7\nmanaging the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements, which has frequently been longer than we originally expected;\n\u00b7\nmanaging customers\u2019 transitions to new products, which can result in delays in their purchasing decisions;\n\u00b7\nadapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers;\n\u00b7\nentering into new or unproven markets with which we have limited experience;\n\u00b7\ntailoring our business and pricing models appropriately as we enter new markets and respond to competitive pressures and technological changes;\n\u00b7\nincorporating and integrating acquired products and technologies; and\n\u00b7\ndeveloping or expanding efficient sales channels.\nIn addition, if we cannot adapt our business models to keep pace with industry trends, our revenues could be negatively impacted. For example, if we increase our adoption of subscription-based pricing models for our products, we may fail to set pricing at levels appropriate to maintain our revenue streams or our customers may choose to deploy products from our competitors that they believe are priced more favorably. Additionally, we may fail to accurately predict subscription renewal rates or their impact on results, and because revenue from subscriptions is recognized for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our results. As we offer more products that depend on converting users of free services to users of premium services and as such services grow in size, our ability to maintain or improve and to predict conversion rates will become more important.\nDelays in releasing enhanced versions of our products and services could adversely affect our competitive position.\nAs part of our strategy, we expect to periodically release enhanced versions of our software products and related services. Even if our new versions contain the features and functionality our customers want, in the event we are unable to timely introduce these new product releases, our competitive position may be harmed. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the development of currently planned or future products in a timely and efficient manner. Due to the complexity of these products, internal quality assurance testing and customer testing of pre-commercial releases may reveal product performance issues or desirable feature enhancements that could lead us to postpone the release of these new versions. In addition, the reallocation of resources associated with any postponement would likely cause delays in the development and release of other future products or enhancements to our currently available products. Any delay in releasing other future products or enhancements of our products could cause our financial results to be adversely impacted.\nWe rely on third-party software that is required for the development and deployment of our software, which may be difficult to obtain or which could cause errors or failures of our software.\nWe rely on software licensed from or hosted by third parties, including Microsoft, to offer our software. We may also need to obtain licenses from third parties to use intellectual property associated with the development of our software, which might not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any software or intellectual property, including the software and intellectual property we currently license from Microsoft, which is required for the development, maintenance and delivery of our software, could result in delays in the provision of our software until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, which could harm our business. Any errors or defects in third-party software could result in errors or a failure of our software, which could harm our business.\nBreaches of cyber security systems could degrade our ability to conduct our business operations and deliver products and services to our customers, delay our ability to recognize revenue, compromise the integrity of our software products, result in significant data losses and the theft of our intellectual property, damage our reputation, expose us to liability to third parties and require us to incur significant additional costs to maintain the security of our networks and data.\nWe increasingly depend upon our IT systems to conduct virtually all of our business operations, ranging from our internal operations and product development activities to our marketing and sales efforts and communications with our customers and business partners. Cyber attacks on our IT systems or the IT systems of third-party contractors could threaten to misappropriate our proprietary information and cause interruptions of our IT services. Because the techniques used to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. We have also outsourced certain business functions to third-party contractors, and our business operations also depend, in part, on the success of our contractors\u2019 own cyber security measures. Similarly, we rely upon distributors, resellers, system vendors and systems integrators to sell our products and our sales operations depend, in part, on the reliability of their cyber security measures. Additionally, we depend upon our employees to appropriately handle confidential data and deploy our IT resources in safe and secure fashion that does not expose our network systems to security breaches and the loss of data. Accordingly, if our cyber security systems and those of our contractors fail to protect against unauthorized access, sophisticated cyber attacks and the mishandling of data by our employees and contractors, our ability to conduct our business effectively could be damaged in a number of ways, including:\n\u00b7\nsensitive data regarding our business, including intellectual property and other proprietary data, could be stolen;\n\u00b7\nour electronic communications systems, including email and other methods, could be disrupted, and our ability to conduct our business operations could be seriously damaged until such systems can be restored and secured;\n\u00b7\nour ability to process customer orders and electronically deliver products and services could be degraded, and our distribution channels could be disrupted, resulting in delays in revenue recognition;\n\u00b7\ndefects and security vulnerabilities could be exploited or introduced into our software products, thereby damaging the reputation and perceived reliability and security of our products and potentially making the data systems of our customers vulnerable to further data loss and cyber incidents; and\n\u00b7\npersonally identifiable data of our customers, employees and business partners could be stolen or lost.\nIn addition, if we acquire Aegis and there is any such breach by Aegis customers, our prospects for Aegis products and services would be significantly compromised.\nIf any of the above events occur, we could be subject to significant claims for liability from our customers, regulatory actions from governmental agencies, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could be compromised and our reputation and competitive position could be significantly harmed. Also, the regulatory and contractual actions, litigations, investigations, fines, penalties and liabilities relating to data breaches that result in losses of personally identifiable or credit card information of users of our services can be significant in terms of fines and reputational impact and necessitate changes to our business operations that may be disruptive to us. Additionally, we could incur significant costs in order to upgrade our cyber security systems and remediate damages. Consequently, our financial performance and results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur software products are highly technical and may contain errors, defects or security vulnerabilities which could cause harm to our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur software products are highly technical and complex and, when deployed, have contained and may contain errors, defects or security vulnerabilities. Some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by customers. Any errors, defects or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn early 2013, we experienced issues with a graphics processing algorithm used in our iRAPP software, which resulted in content not displaying properly, hidden sessions not functioning correctly and remote printing problems. Consequently, rather than working on a new edition of our iRAPP software, we were forced to spend the first six months of 2013 fixing the faulty algorithm and providing customers with temporary software repairs. Our software development plans and software sales were delayed due to having to fix the faulty algorithm. Although we have not quantified the financial impact of our development and sales delays due to these technical algorithm issues, we do not consider that such costs were material. The technical algorithm issues were fully resolved and a new edition of our iRAPP software was released in November 2013. If similar or more significant technical problems with our software offerings were to arise in the future (none of which are known by us to currently exist), they may involve material costs and negatively impact our results of operations.\nUndiscovered vulnerabilities in our products could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that could attack our products. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases or to use competitive products. End users, who rely on our products and services for the interoperability of enterprise servers and applications that are critical to their information systems, may have a greater sensitivity to product errors and security vulnerabilities than customers for software products generally. Any security breaches could lead to interruptions, delays and data loss and protection concerns. In addition, we could face claims for product liability, tort or breach of warranty, including claims relating to changes to our products made by our channel partners. Our contracts with customers contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, which may not be upheld and customers and channel partners may seek indemnification from us for their losses and those of their customers. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and time-consuming and may divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of us and our products. In addition, if our business liability insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIf operating system and hardware vendors do not cooperate with us or we are unable to obtain early access to their new products or to certain information about their new products to ensure that our software interoperates with those products, our product development efforts may be delayed or foreclosed.\nOur products interoperate with Windows and other operating systems, including Apple, and the hardware devices of numerous manufacturers. Developing products that interoperate properly requires substantial partnering, capital investment and employee resources, as well as the cooperation of the vendors or developers of the operating systems and hardware. Operating system and hardware vendors may not provide us with early access to their technology and products, assist us in these development efforts or share with or sell to us any application programming interfaces, or APIs, formats, or protocols we may need. If they do not provide us with the necessary early access, assistance or proprietary technology on a timely basis, we may experience product development delays or be unable to expand our products into other areas. To the extent that software or hardware vendors develop products that compete with ours, they may have an incentive to withhold their cooperation, decline to share access or sell to us their proprietary APIs, protocols or formats or engage in practices to actively limit the functionality, or compatibility, and certification of our products. To the extent that we enter into collaborations or joint development and marketing arrangements with certain hardware and software vendors, vendors who compete with our collaborative partners may similarly choose to limit their cooperation with us. In addition, hardware or operating system vendors may fail to certify or support or continue to certify or support our products for their systems. Our products depend on certain existing operating system protocols, including those by Microsoft and Apple, which may be changed without notice to us in a manner that compromises the effectiveness of our products in a manner that materially and adversely impacts our revenues and prospects. If any of the foregoing occurs, our product development efforts may be delayed or foreclosed and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on distributors and resellers to sell our products, and our failure to effectively develop, manage or prevent disruptions to our distribution channels and the processes and procedures that support them could cause a reduction in the number of end users of our products.\nOur future success is highly dependent upon maintaining and increasing the number of our relationships with distributors and resellers. Because we rely on distributors and resellers, we may have little or no contact with the ultimate users of our products, thereby making it more difficult for us to establish brand awareness, ensure proper delivery and installation of our products, service ongoing customer requirements, estimate end-user demand and respond to evolving customer needs.\nOur competitors may be effective in providing incentives to existing and potential channel partners to favor products of our competitors or to prevent or reduce sales of our products. Certain system vendors now offer competing virtualization products preinstalled on their server products. Additionally, our competitors could attempt to require key distributors to enter into exclusivity arrangements with them or otherwise apply their pricing or marketing leverage to discourage distributors from offering our products. Accordingly, our channel partners may choose not to offer our products exclusively or at all. Our failure to maintain and increase the number of relationships with channel partners would likely lead to a loss of end users of our products which would result in us receiving lower revenues from our channel partners. If we were to lose the distribution services of a significant distributor, such loss could have a negative impact on our results of operations until such time as we arrange to replace these distribution services with the services of existing or new distributors.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and a failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing.\nOur business and operations may consume resources faster than we anticipate. In the future, we will need to raise additional funds to invest in our ThinOps acquisition, our proposed acquisition of Aegis and other future growth opportunities. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could seriously harm our business and operating results. If we incur debt, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations.\nOur business is subject to a variety of United States and international laws and regulations regarding data protection.\nOur business is subject to federal, state and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and protection of personal data. We and our third-party contractors collect contact and other personal or identifying information from our customers. Additionally, in connection with some of our new product initiatives, our customers may use our services to store and process personal information and other user data. We post, on our websites, our privacy policies and practices concerning our treatment of personal data. We also often include privacy commitments in our contracts. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations, or the privacy commitments contained in our contracts could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business.\nIt is possible that these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines and penalties, a governmental order requiring that we change our data practices could have a material adverse effect on our business. Compliance with such an order may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or we could be ordered to cease conducting the noncompliant activity.\nIn addition to government regulation, privacy advocacy and industry groups or other third parties may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to our customers or us. Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy or data-protection laws, regulations and standards, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and harm our business.\nAdditionally, our terminal services technology is used by cloud computing vendors, and we have expanded our involvement in the delivery and provision of cloud computing through business alliances with various providers of cloud computing services and software and expect to continue to do so in the future. The application of U.S. and international data privacy laws to cloud computing vendors is uncertain, and our existing contractual provisions may prove to be inadequate to protect us from claims for data loss or regulatory noncompliance made against cloud computing providers who we may partner with. Accordingly, the failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations by our customers and business partners who provide cloud computing services could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. As such, despite our efforts, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the United States. In addition, we rely on confidentiality or license agreements with third parties in connection with their use of our products and technology. There is no guarantee that such parties will abide by the terms of such agreements or that we will be able to adequately enforce our rights.\nDetecting and protecting against the unauthorized use of our products, technology and proprietary rights is expensive, difficult and, in some cases, impossible. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, and there is no guarantee we would be successful. Further, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to protecting their technology or intellectual property rights than we do. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property, which could result in a substantial loss of our market share.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software in our products could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to possible litigation.\nA small portion of the products, technologies or services acquired, licensed, developed or offered by us may incorporate so-called \u201copen source\u201d software, and we may incorporate open source software into other products in the future. Such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses, including, for example, the GNU General Public License, the GNU Lesser General Public License, \u201cApache-style\u201d licenses, \u201cBSD-style\u201d licenses and other open source licenses. We monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend. Although we believe we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for the open source software we use, there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of most of these licenses, and, therefore, the potential impact of these terms on our business is somewhat unknown and may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our products and technologies.\nIf an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations. Although we have received inquiries regarding open source license compliance for software used in our products, no formal legal proceedings that would have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition have been filed. However, there can be no assurance that actions will not be taken in the future. If our defenses were not successful, we could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the distribution of our products that contained the open source software and required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our products. In addition, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, under some open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, which could substantially help our competitors develop products that are similar to or better than ours.\nIn addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software exposes us to risks that differ from the use of third-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or assurance of title or controls on the origin of the software. In addition, many of the risks associated with usage of open source software such as the lack of warranties or assurances of title, cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. We have established processes to help address these risks, including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source and conducting appropriate due diligence of the use of open source software in the products developed by companies we acquire, but we cannot ensure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products or is discovered during due diligence.\nOur growth strategy depends, in part, on our acquiring businesses, products and technologies and expanding their existing operations, which we may be unable to do.\nOur growth strategy is based, in part, on our ability to acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies. The success of this acquisition strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to accomplish the following:\n\u00b7\nidentify suitable businesses or assets to buy;\n\u00b7\ncomplete the purchase of those businesses on terms acceptable to us;\n\u00b7\ncomplete the acquisition(s) in the time frame and within the budget we expect; and\n\u00b7\nimprove the results of operations of each of the businesses that we buy and successfully integrate its operations on an accretive basis.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in any or all of the steps above. Our failure to successfully implement our acquisition strategy could have an adverse effect on other aspects of our business strategy and our business in general. We may not be able to find appropriate acquisition candidates, assertively acquire those candidates that we identify or integrate acquired businesses effectively and profitably.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nIn order to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we need to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them to changes as our business changes and we rearrange management responsibilities and reorganize our business accordingly. We may seek to automate certain processes to improve efficiencies and better ensure ongoing compliance but such automation may itself disrupt existing internal controls and introduce unintended vulnerability to error or fraud. This continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with Section 404 is expensive and time-consuming, and requires significant management attention. We cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with Section 404. Further, as our business changes and as we expand through acquisitions of other companies, our internal controls may become more complex and we will require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls overall remain effective. Failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market\u2019s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price. In addition, if we are unable to continue to comply with Section 404, our non-compliance could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions, including the suspension or delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market and the inability of registered broker-dealers to make a market in our common stock, which could reduce our stock price.\nProblems with our information systems could interfere with our business that could adversely impact our operations.\nWe rely on our information systems and those of third parties for processing customer orders, delivery of products, providing services and support to our customers, billing and tracking our customers, fulfilling contractual obligations and otherwise running our business. Any disruption in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business. In addition, we continuously work to enhance our information systems. The implementation of these types of enhancements is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise, which may especially be the case for us due to the size and complexity of our business. Any disruptions relating to our systems enhancements, particularly any disruptions impacting our operations during the implementation period, could adversely affect our business in a number of respects. Even if we do not encounter these adverse effects, the implementation of these enhancements may be much more costly than we anticipated. If we are unable to successfully implement the information systems enhancements as planned, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nIn future periods, we could incur losses due to impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of the acquisition of ThinOps during July, 2015. At December 31, 2015, the carrying value of our goodwill was $9.2 million. The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of an acquired business in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. We are required to test goodwill for impairment annually and do so during the fourth quarter of each year, as well as on an interim basis to the extent that factors or indicators become apparent that could reduce the fair value of any of our reporting units below its book value. Such factors requiring an interim test for goodwill impairment include, but are not limited to, financial performance indicators such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings and a sustained decrease in share price. Our cash flow estimates involve projections that are inherently subject to change based on future events. A significant downward revision in the fair value of our ThinOps business unit that causes the carrying value to exceed the fair value could cause goodwill to be considered impaired, and could result in a non-cash impairment charge in our consolidated statement of operations.\nThe forecasts utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis as part of our impairment test assume future revenue and profitability growth in our ThinOps business segment during the next five years and beyond. If ThinOps cannot obtain, or we determine at a later date that we no longer expect them to obtain the projected levels of profitability, future goodwill impairment tests may also result in an impairment charge. There can be no assurances that our operating divisions will be able to achieve our estimated levels of profitability. We cannot be certain that goodwill impairment will not be required during future periods.\nChanges in accounting principles and guidance, or their interpretation, could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects, including changes to our previously filed financial statements, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. A change in these principles or guidance, or in their interpretations, may have a significant effect on our reported results and retroactively affect previously reported results.\nBeing a public company results in additional expenses and diverts management\u2019s attention, and could also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified directors.\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These requirements generate significant accounting, legal and financial compliance costs, and make some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly, and may place significant strain on our personnel and resources. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to establish the requisite disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, significant resources and management oversight are required.\nAs a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could have an adverse and even material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These rules and regulations may also make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. If we are unable to obtain appropriate director and officer insurance, our ability to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors, especially those directors who may be deemed independent, could be adversely impacted.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and our election to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies may result in our financial statements not being comparable to those of some other public companies. As a result of this and other reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our securities may be less attractive to investors.\nAs a public reporting company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements and is relieved of certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. In particular, among other things, as an emerging growth company we:\n\u00b7\nare not required to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on our management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u00b7\nare permitted to omit the detailed narrative disclosure discussing our compensation principles, objectives and elements and analysis how those elements fit with our principles and objectives (commonly referred to as \u201ccompensation discussion and analysis\u201d) from proxy statements and reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 and registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933 and instead to provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation;\n\u00b7\nare not required to obtain a non-binding advisory vote from our stockholders on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements (commonly referred to as the \u201csay-on-pay,\u201d \u201csay-on-frequency\u201d and \u201csay-on-golden-parachute\u201d votes);\n\u00b7\nare exempt from certain executive compensation disclosure provisions requiring a pay-for-performance graph and CEO pay ratio disclosure;\n\u00b7\nare eligible to claim longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under Sec.107 of the JOBS Act.\nUnder the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of the above-described reduced reporting requirements and exemptions for up to five years after our initial sale of common equity pursuant to a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, or such earlier time that we no longer meet the definition of an emerging growth company. In this regard, the JOBS Act provides that we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenues, have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion in principal amount of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nWe intend to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under Sec.107 of the JOBS Act. Our election to use the phase-in periods may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the phase-in periods under Sec.107 of the JOBS Act. As such, we cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive due to our reliance on these exemptions.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nWe are required to comply with the SEC's rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of controls over financial reporting. Though we are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis, we will not be required to make our first annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until next year. However, as an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the end of the fiscal year for which our second annual report is due or the date we are no longer an emerging growth company. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.\nTo comply with the requirements of being a public company, we have undertaken various actions, and may need to take additional actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. Testing and maintaining internal control can divert our management's attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. Additionally, when evaluating our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. If we identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting once we are no longer an emerging growth company, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the Nasdaq Capital Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nHaving only three executive officers and two independent directors limits our ability to establish effective independent corporate governance procedures and increases the control of our executive officers and non-independent directors.\nWe have only three executive officers and five directors. Two of our directors are also executive officers and our two largest individual stockholders. Two of our directors are considered independent. Accordingly, it is difficult to establish effective operating board committees comprised of independent members to oversee committee functions. This structure gives our executive officers and largest stockholder significant control over all our corporate governance matters.\nUnless and until we have a larger board of directors that would include a majority of independent members and unless we have an Audit Committee with a financial expert, there will be limited oversight of our executive officers\u2019 decisions and activities and little ability for you to challenge or reverse those decisions and activities, even if they are not in your best interests. We do not currently have a financial expert that serves on our Audit Committee.\nNew tax treatment of companies engaged in internet commerce may adversely affect the commercial use of our services and our financial results.\nDue to the global nature of internet commerce, it is possible that various states or foreign countries might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales, income or other taxes relating to our activities. Tax authorities at the international, federal, state and local levels are currently reviewing the appropriate treatment of companies engaged in internet commerce. New or revised international, federal, state or local tax regulations may subject us or our creators to additional sales, income and other taxes. We cannot predict the effect of current attempts to impose sales, income or other taxes on commerce over social media. New or revised taxes and, in particular, sales taxes, VAT and similar taxes would likely increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of advertising and selling goods and services over social media. New taxes could also create significant increases in internal costs necessary to capture data, and collect and remit taxes. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Securities\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe stock market, in general, and the stock prices of technology-based companies in particular, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7\nchanges in our industry;\n\u00b7\ncompetitive pricing pressures;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain working capital financing;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nlimited \u201cpublic float\u201d in the hands of a small number of persons whose sales or lack of sales could result in positive or negative pricing pressure on the market prices of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nexpiration of any Rule 144 holding periods or registration of unregistered securities issued by us;\n\u00b7\nsales of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nour ability to execute our business plan;\n\u00b7\noperating results that fall below expectations;\n\u00b7\nloss of any strategic relationship;\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments; and\n\u00b7\neconomic and other external factors.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe concentration of our common stock ownership by our current management will limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur directors and executive officers beneficially own and are able to vote in the aggregate approximately 29.3% of our outstanding common stock. As such, our directors and executive officers, as stockholders, will continue to have the ability to exert significant influence over all corporate activities, including the election or removal of directors and the outcome of tender offers, mergers, proxy contests or other purchases of common stock that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for their shares of common stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. In addition, such concentrated control could discourage others from initiating changes of control. In such cases, the perception of our prospects in the market may be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline.\nOur Board of Directors\u2019 ability to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and any anti-takeover provisions we adopt may depress the value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes 5,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. This means that our Board of Directors has the power to issue any or all of the shares of such preferred stock, including the authority to establish one or more series and to fix the powers, preferences, rights and limitations of such class or series, without seeking stockholder approval, subject to certain limitations on this power under the rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market. The authority of our Board of Directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, along with any future anti-takeover measures we may adopt, may, in certain circumstances, delay, deter or prevent takeover attempts and other changes in control of our company that are not approved by our Board of Directors. As a result, our stockholders may lose opportunities to dispose of their shares at favorable prices generally available in takeover attempts or that may be available under a merger proposal and the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may also be affected.\nOur common stock could be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, which delisting could hinder your ability to obtain accurate quotations on the price of our common stock, or dispose of our common stock in the secondary market.\nWe cannot guarantee that there will continue to be an active public market for our common stock. In order to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock must sustain a minimum bid price of at least $1.00 per share and we must satisfy the other requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In the event our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, trading in our common stock could thereafter be conducted in the over-the-counter markets on a trading tier of the OTC Markets or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, the liquidity of our common stock would likely be impaired, not only in the number of shares which could be bought and sold, but also through delays in the timing of the transactions, and there would likely be a reduction in the coverage of our company by security analysts and the news media, thereby resulting in lower prices for our common stock than might otherwise prevail.\nExercise of stock options, warrants and other securities will dilute your percentage of ownership and could cause our stock price to fall.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 13,879,225 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, outstanding options to purchase 400,627 shares of our common stock, at an exercise price of $2.44 per share and outstanding warrants to purchase 120,539 shares of common stock at an average price of $2.33 per share. Additionally, we have reserved shares to issue stock options, restricted stock or other awards to purchase or receive up to 1,103,834 shares of common stock under our November 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. In the future, we may grant additional stock options, warrants and convertible securities. The exercise, conversion or exchange of stock options, warrants or convertible securities will dilute the percentage ownership of our other stockholders. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to fall and could impair our ability to raise capital by selling additional securities.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our Board of Directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nInvestor relations activities and supply and demand factors may affect the price of our common stock.\nWe expect to utilize various techniques such as non-deal road shows and investor relations campaigns in order to create investor awareness for our business. These campaigns may include personal, video and telephone conferences with investors and prospective investors in which our business practices are described. We may provide compensation to investor relations firms and pay for newsletters, websites, mailings and email campaigns that are produced by third parties based upon publicly available information concerning us. We do not intend to review or approve the content of such analysts\u2019 reports or other materials based upon analysts\u2019 own research or methods. Investor relations firms should generally disclose when they are compensated for their efforts, but whether such disclosure is made or complete is not under our control. Our investors may be willing, from time to time, to encourage investor awareness through similar activities. Investor awareness activities may also be suspended or discontinued which may impact the trading market of our common stock.\nThe SEC, the Nasdaq Capital Market and FINRA enforce various statutes and regulations intended to prevent manipulative or deceptive devices in connection with the purchase or sale of any security and carefully scrutinize trading patterns and company news and other communications for false or misleading information, particularly in cases where the hallmarks of \u201cpump and dump\u201d activities may exist, such as rapid share price increases or decreases.\nThe Supreme Court has stated that manipulative action is a term of art connoting intentional or willful conduct designed to deceive or defraud investors by controlling or artificially affecting the price of securities. Often times, manipulation is associated by regulators with forces that upset the supply and demand factors that would normally determine trading prices. Securities regulators have often cited thinly-traded markets, small numbers of holders, and awareness campaigns as components of their claims of price manipulation and other violations of law when combined with manipulative trading, such as wash sales, matched orders or other manipulative trading timed to coincide with false or touting press releases. There can be no assurance that our third-parties\u2019 activities or determinations by purchasers or holders as to when or under what circumstances or at what prices they may be willing to buy or sell stock, will not artificially impact (or would be claimed by regulators to have affected) the normal supply and demand factors that determine the price of stock.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger with Aegis\nThere can be no assurances that the proposed merger with Aegis will be consummated as contemplated in accordance with the definitive merger agreement.\nThere can be no assurances that the proposed merger with Aegis will be consummated as originally contemplated, or that the Company will realize any or all of the benefits that the management expected to realize upon the consummation of the proposed merger.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively affect the value of the Company\u2019s common stock and its future business and financial results.\nIf the Merger is not completed, the Company\u2019s ongoing business could be adversely affected, and it would be subject to a variety of risks associated with the failure to complete the Merger, including the following:\n\u00b7\nbeing required, under certain circumstances, to pay Aegis a termination fee;\n\u00b7\nincurrence of substantial costs in connection with the proposed Merger and related transactions, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory, filing, printing and mailing fees;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management focus and resources from operational matters and other strategic opportunities while working to implement the Merger; and\n\u00b7\nreputational harm due to the adverse perception of any failure to successfully complete the Merger.\nIf the Merger is not completed, these risks could materially affect the Company\u2019s business and financial results and the price of its common stock.\nThe pendency of the Merger could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and operations.\nPrior to consummation of the Merger, some of the Company may delay, defer or withdraw their business with the Company, which could negatively affect revenues, earnings, cash flows and expenses, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. Similarly, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Code Rebel following the Merger, which may materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the Merger. In addition, due to operating restrictions in the Merger Agreement, the Company may be unable, during the pendency of the Merger to pursue strategic transactions, undertake significant capital projects, undertake certain significant financing transactions and otherwise pursue other actions, even if such actions would prove beneficial.\nThe consummation of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions which, if not satisfied or waived in a timely manner, would delay the Merger or adversely impact our ability to complete the transactions.\nThe completion of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, the receipt of the approval of the Merger and adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. While it is currently anticipated that the Merger will be completed in the second quarter of 2016, there can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all, or that an effect, event, development or change will not transpire that could delay or prevent these conditions from being satisfied. If the Merger has not been consummated by June 30, 2016 either the Company or Aegis may terminate the Merger Agreement.\nSubsequent to the consummation of the proposed merger with Aegis, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nAlthough we have conducted due diligence on Aegis, we cannot assure you that this diligence revealed all material issues that may be present in Aegis\u2019 business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of our and Aegis\u2019 control will not later arise. As a result, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure its operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about the combined company or its securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to be unable to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.\nWe expect to incur significant transaction and transition costs in connection with the proposed merger with Aegis.\nWe expect to incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with proposed merger with Aegis. All expenses incurred in connection with the proposed merger and the transactions contemplated thereby, including all legal, accounting, investment banking and other fees, expenses and costs, will be paid by the party incurring such fees, expenses and costs.\nWe hold significant amounts of outstanding Aegis debt in connection with the proposed merger.\nIn connection with our proposed acquisition of Aegis, we provided an unsecured loan to Aegis of $621,448. This loan is evidenced by a promissory note which bears interest at a rate of 9% per annum. Although it is contemplated that the obligations of Aegis will be discharged upon the consummation of the acquisition, there can be no guarantee that the acquisition will be consummated as proposed or that Aegis will have sufficient liquidity to repay the loan in full or in part.\nIn connection with our proposed acquisition of Aegis, we will increase the amount of our consolidated indebtedness by an amount estimated to be approximately $1.75 million. While we considered the amount of Aegis net assets and its debt and the terms of the outstanding debt when determining the amount of the merger consideration, the increased amount of our consolidated debt may adversely impact our access to capital and impact our operating cash flow.\nOur ability to successfully effect the proposed merger with Aegis and successfully operate the business thereafter will be largely dependent upon the efforts of certain key personnel, including the key personnel of Aegis, all of whom we expect to stay with Aegis following the proposed merger. The loss of such key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of the post-merger business.\nOur ability to successfully effect the proposed merger with Aegis and successfully operate the business is dependent upon the efforts of certain key personnel, including the key personnel of Aegis. Although we expect all of such key personnel to remain with Aegis following the proposed merger, it is possible that we will lose some key personnel, the loss of which could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. Furthermore, while we will scrutinize individuals we intend to engage to stay with Aegis following the proposed merger, our assessment of these individuals may not prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements.\nWe will issue a substantial amount of our common stock in connection with the proposed merger with Aegis.\nOn March 14, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (\u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with Aegis. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, our wholly owned subsidiary will merge with and into Aegis and Aegis will become a wholly owned subsidiary. As consideration under the Merger Agreement, we will issue up to 60% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, determined on a fully diluted basis. As contemplated, our company would be the surviving entity in the merger. However, it is expected that there will be the issuance of a substantial number of shares of common stock in connection with the merger that we expect could significantly dilute the percentage ownership interests of our existing common stockholders.\nIf the benefits of the proposed merger with Aegis do not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders or financial analysts, the market price of our securities may decline.\nIf the benefits of the proposed merger with Aegis do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of our common stock prior to the closing of the proposed merger may decline. The market value of our common stock at the time of the proposed merger may vary significantly from their prices on the date of the Merger agreement or the date on which our stockholders vote on the proposed merger.\nIn addition, following the proposed merger, fluctuations in the price of our common stock could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. Prior to the proposed merger, there has not been a public market for Aegis\u2019 stock. Accordingly, the valuation ascribed to Aegis and our common stock in the proposed merger may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market following the proposed merger. If an active market for our common stock continues, the trading price of our securities following the proposed merger could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our securities and our securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nFactors affecting the trading price of our common stock following the proposed merger may include:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u00b7\nsuccess of competitors;\n\u00b7\nour operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u00b7\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our company;\n\u00b7\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to our company;\n\u00b7\nour ability to market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u00b7\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u00b7\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving our company;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u00b7\nthe volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale;\n\u00b7\nany major change in our board or management;\n\u00b7\nsales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock irrespective of our operating performance. The stock markets, in general, including the NASDAQ markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to the Company could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nStockholders holding restricted shares of common stock may sell shares under Rule 144 in a manner that adversely affects our share price, even if our business is doing well.\nThe shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger are restricted shares and we expect most, if not all, of such shares to be eligible for trading under Rule 144 of the Securities Act six months after the Merger closing. Stockholders holding such shares restricting common stock are permitted sell such shares in public market transactions in accordance with Rule 144, which permits the resale of restricted common stock without requiring registration, subject to various terms and conditions, including certain volume limitations that are applicable if the stockholder is an affiliate of ours or acquired shares from an affiliate within a specified period of time, which is, generally, six months after the effective date of the merger for stockholders that are not an affiliate of us. Rule 144 effectively permits stockholders to sell shares of restricted common stock as if such shares were registered. If a large number of our shares of restricted common stock are sold in market transactions, or otherwise, there would be significant selling pressure and the market price of our Common Stock would be adversely affected, even if our business is doing well and the price does not reflect the true fair value of our shares of Common Stock. Any such event could also impair our ability to raise capital.", "PERMNO": 15367, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "CDRBQ"}
