{"cik": "1319947", "company": "Designer Brands Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our Class A common shares involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K and in our other public filings, investors should carefully consider the following risk factors. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. The occurrence of any of the following risks, or the occurrence of additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our Class A common shares could decline, and investors may lose all or part of their original investment. This Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements and estimates as a result of specific factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below.\nRISKS RELATING TO MACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY CONDITIONS\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business, operations, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on our business and financial performance, particularly in 2020, and we expect this adverse impact to continue. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration, severity and any resurgences of the COVID-19 pandemic, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nFor instance, we have continued to experience reduced store traffic and net sales as compared to pre-COVID-19 periods, and it is unclear when customer behavior will return to pre-COVID-19 patterns, if at all. The ongoing and prolonged nature of the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to further adjustments to our operations. As such, the ultimate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses will depend on future developments, including the availability of labor, global supply chain disruptions, new emerging variants of COVID-19 and the severity thereof, and the global availability and use of vaccines or palliatives, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. As a result, we may have future write-downs or adjustments to inventories, receivables, long-lived assets, intangibles, goodwill, and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also has the potential to significantly impact our supply chain if the factories that manufacture our products, the distribution systems we use to manage our inventory, or the operations of our logistics and other service providers are disrupted, temporarily closed or experience worker shortages. All of the products manufactured through the Brand Portfolio segment come from third-party facilities outside of the U.S., with 75% sourced from China during 2021, whereas our U.S. Retail segment and Canada Retail segment merchandise is purchased from both domestic and foreign vendors. Many of our domestic vendors import a large portion of their merchandise from abroad, with the majority manufactured in China. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to work and travel restrictions within, to, and out of mainland China, which in turn may affect our manufacturers as well as our vendors' manufacturers. The COVID-19 pandemic may also make it difficult for our suppliers and our vendors' suppliers to source raw materials from, manufacture goods in, and export products from China and other countries. If the severity and reach of the COVID-19 pandemic continues or worsens, there may be significant and material disruptions to our supply chain and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe rely on consumer discretionary spending, which may be adversely affected by economic downturns and other macroeconomic conditions or trends, and/or negatively impacted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur business and operating results are subject to global economic conditions and their impact on consumer discretionary spending. Many factors that may negatively influence consumer spending are becoming increasingly present as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and political instability, including high levels of instability in the job market, higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth, declines in certain asset values and related market uncertainty, fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, general uncertainty regarding the overall future political and economic environment, recent large-scale social unrest across much of the U.S., international turmoil and conflicts, war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, trade policies and sanctions. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our products, generally decline during periods of economic uncertainty, when disposable income is reduced, or when there is a reduction in consumer confidence. Additionally, any of these adverse economic, political, or social conditions may have the effect of directly or indirectly impacting our operating results in a negative manner. Moreover, we are unable to predict the severity of macroeconomic uncertainty, whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or the full impact such circumstances could have on our business.\nOur industry is subject to cost and pricing pressures that may be exacerbated by the impacts of inflation, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business and operations.\nThe retail industry is subject to cost and pricing pressures and uncertainties throughout the supply chain. Pricing pressure has been exacerbated by the variability and availability of raw materials in recent months, combined with labor and cost inflation and uncertainty throughout the supply chain. These factors could require us to enact mitigating pricing actions and operating efficiency measures that could have a material adverse effect on customer demand.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS\nWe may be unable to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences, changing customer expectations, and fashion trends, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDemand for our products fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences and trends, which are dictated by lifestyle, fashion and season, and may shift quickly. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our business experienced a shift in consumer behavior and corresponding preferences to increased demand for athleisure and casual products and away from dress and seasonal categories. This shift requires us to anticipate and respond to numerous and fluctuating variables in fashion trends and other conditions in the markets in which our customers are situated. A variety of factors will affect our ability to maintain the proper mix of products, including: local economic conditions impacting customers' discretionary spending; unanticipated fashion trends; our ability to provide timely access to popular brands at attractive prices; our success in distributing merchandise to our stores and our wholesale retailer customers in an efficient manner; and changes in weather patterns, which, in turn, may affect consumer preferences. If we are unable to anticipate trends and fulfill the merchandise needs of our customers, we may experience decreases in our net sales and/or may be forced to increase markdowns in relation to slow-moving merchandise, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs we look ahead to our strategic growth initiatives, we have organized our efforts around three pillars:\n\u2022Customer- We are focused on offering great products and differentiated experiences in order to drive customer engagement and loyalty.\n\u2022Brand- We will continue to prioritize growing our own brands while also partnering with some of the top brands in the industry in order to offer one of the largest assortments.\n\u2022Speed- We are exploring improved processes to deliver products to our customers more quickly.\nAchieving these priorities depends in part on us executing our strategies successfully, and the initiatives that we implement in connection with these strategies may not resonate with our customers. We may not be able to realize, in whole or in part, the anticipated benefits of these strategies or within the expected time frames. In the event that our strategies do not meet customer expectations or are not differentiated from our competitors' offerings, it may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, these efforts could place increased demands on our financial, managerial, operational, and administrative resources. We are investing in additional resources, both capital and personnel, and will be implementing new systems and processes or changes to existing systems and processes. These investments could cost more than anticipated, divert resources from other areas of our business, and fail to yield the anticipated benefits, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could also experience downtime or other technical issues as we make changes to our systems and processes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on our strong relationships with vendors to purchase products. If these relationships were to be impaired, we may be unable to obtain a sufficient assortment of merchandise at attractive prices or respond promptly to changing fashion trends, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nOur success depends, to a significant extent, on the willingness and ability of our vendors to supply us with merchandise that meets our changing customer expectations, especially as we concentrate our receipts to fewer branded vendors. If we fail to maintain strong relationships with these vendors or if they fail to ensure the quality of merchandise that they supply to us, our ability to provide our customers with merchandise they want at favorable prices may be limited, which could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, our merchandise costs have increased and may increase further due to increased costs incurred by our vendors in raw materials, energy, labor, freight, or duties and taxes on imports, or other reasons, our ability to respond or the effect of our response could adversely affect our net sales or gross profit. Further, any negative brand image, widespread product defects, financial distress, or negative publicity related to our key vendors, or other vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and on our business.\nDecisions by vendors not to sell to us or to limit the availability of their products to us could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, our inability to stock our sales channels with desired merchandise at attractive prices could result in lower net sales and decreased customer interest in our sales channels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. During 2021, three key third-party vendors together supplied approximately 20% of our retail merchandise, with no individual vendor providing more than 10% of our retail merchandise. The loss of, or a reduction in, the amount and quality of merchandise supplied by any of our high-volume vendors could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, one of these top three vendors, Nike, Inc., ceased shipping products to us during the third quarter of 2021. In order to replace this brand, we are expanding and concentrating our volume of exclusive branded products, wholesale products from our Brand Portfolio segment, and with other high-volume vendors. If we are unable to offer suitable alternatives to satisfy product demand, sales could decline which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nLosses or disruptions associated with our distribution systems, including our distribution centers and fulfillment center and stores, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur operating results depend on the orderly operation of our receiving, distribution, and fulfillment processes, which in turn depends on vendors' adherence to shipping schedules and our effective management of our facilities. We may not anticipate all the changing demands on our operations, and events beyond our control may occur, including disruptions in operations due to public health threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, delays in the integration of new stores, catastrophic events, shortages in labor, or shipping problems, any of which may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers. We rely on the flow of goods through ports worldwide on a consistent basis from factories and suppliers. Disruptions at ports could create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disruptions occur during peak importing times. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in delays at ports due to shipping backlog, availability of vessels, capacity constraints, and other disruptions. If we experience significant delays in receiving product, this could result in canceled orders by retailer customers, unanticipated inventory shortages or receipt of seasonal product after the peak selling season, and increased expense of air freight, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur distribution system is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties. The COVID-19 pandemic could also impact our ability to timely meet our customers' needs for fulfillment due to disruptions with third-party vendors, carriers, and other service providers, as well as increased freight and logistics costs. We are also subject to risk of damage or loss during delivery by our shipping vendors. If our merchandise is not delivered in a timely fashion or is damaged or lost during the delivery process, our customers could become dissatisfied and cease shopping on our sites, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we encounter problems with our ability to timely and satisfactorily fulfill customer orders, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, and complete sales, such problems could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we maintain business interruption and property insurance, in the event any of our points within our distribution system were to shut down for any reason or if we were to incur higher costs and longer lead times in connection with a disruption, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover the impact to the business.\nThe success of our Brand Portfolio segment is dependent on our third-party manufacturers and other business partners.\nThe success of our Brand Portfolio segment depends on our ability to obtain products from our third-party manufacturers on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, and to our specifications. We do not exert direct control over the manufacturers' operations and cannot guarantee that any third-party manufacturer will have sufficient production capacity, meet our production deadlines, or meet our product safety, social compliance, or quality standards. We typically do not have long-term supply contracts with our manufacturers, and the loss of any of our major manufacturers could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of global events such as inclement weather, natural disasters, public health threats, or acts of terrorism. If these third-party manufacturers do not perform their obligations, cease working with us, fail to meet our product safety, social compliance or quality standards, or are unable to provide us with the materials and services we need at prices and terms that are acceptable to us, such disruptions may cause product delays and shortages, failure to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis, and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe success of our Brand Portfolio segment is dependent on the strength of our relationships with our retailer customers, and reductions in or loss of sales to such customers as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur major retailer customers have experienced and may continue to experience a significant downturn in their businesses as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and, in turn, these customers have reduced, and may continue to reduce, their purchases from us, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the Brand Portfolio segment.\nWe are dependent on our customer loyalty programs and marketing to drive traffic, sales and loyalty, and any decrease in membership or purchases from members could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCustomer traffic is influenced by our marketing and our loyalty programs. We rely on our loyalty programs to drive customer traffic, sales, and purchase frequency. Loyalty members earn points toward discounts on future purchases through our VIP rewards programs in the U.S. and Canada. We employ a variety of marketing methods, including email, direct mail, and social media, to communicate exclusive offers to our rewards members. As of January 29, 2022, we have approximately 28 million members enrolled in our loyalty programs who have made at least one purchase over the last two years. In 2021, shoppers in the loyalty programs generated approximately 87% of the combined U.S. Retail and Canada Retail segments' net sales. In the event that our rewards members do not continue to shop, we fail to add new members, the number of members decreases, or our marketing is not effective in driving customer traffic, such event could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to retain our existing senior management team and to continue to attract qualified new personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization, which requires an experienced and talented management team. If we were to lose the benefit of the experience, efforts and abilities of any of our key executives and sourcing and buying personnel, our business could be adversely affected. We have entered into employment agreements with several key executives and also offer compensation packages designed to attract and retain talent. Furthermore, our ability to manage our business will require us to continue to train, motivate, and develop our associates to maintain a high level of talent for future challenges and succession planning. Competition for these types of personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business.\nThe loss or disruption of information technology services could affect our ability to implement our strategies and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur information technology systems are an integral part of our strategies in efficiently operating our business, in managing operations, and protecting against security risks related to our electronic processing and transmitting of confidential customer and associate data. The requirements to keep our information technology systems operating at peak performance may be higher than anticipated and could strain our capital resources, management of any system upgrades, implementation of new systems and the related change management processes required with new systems and our ability to prevent any future information security breaches. In addition, any significant disruption of our data center could have a material adverse effect on those operations dependent on those systems, specifically, our store and e-commerce operations, our distribution centers and fulfillment center and our merchandising team. While we maintain business interruption and property insurance, in the event of a data center shutdown, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover the impact to the business.\nOur e-commerce operations are important to our business and are subject to various risks of operating online and mobile selling capabilities such as the failure of our information technology infrastructure, including any third-party hardware or software, resulting in downtime or other technical issues; reliance on third-party logistics providers to deliver our products to customers; inability to respond to technological changes; violations of state or federal laws; credit card fraud; or other information security breaches. Failure to mitigate these risks could reduce e-commerce sales, damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe face risks related to our electronic processing of sensitive and confidential personal and business data. If such data are lost or disclosed in an unauthorized manner, or if we or our third-party vendors are subject to cyberattacks, data breaches, other security incidents, or disruption of information technology systems or software, such events could expose us to liability, could damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGiven the nature of our business, we, together with third parties acting on our behalf, receive, collect, process, use, and retain sensitive and confidential customer and associate data, in addition to proprietary business information. Our business relies on information technology networks and systems to market and sell our products, process financial and personal information, manage a variety of business processes, and comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. We also depend on a variety of information systems to effectively process customer orders and other data, for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our associates, customers, prospective customers, and vendors. Some of our third-party service providers, such as identity verification and payment processing providers, also regularly have access to customer data. Additionally, we maintain other confidential, proprietary, or otherwise sensitive information relating to our business and from third parties.\nThe information technology networks and systems owned, operated, controlled or used by us or our vendors may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns, software or hardware vulnerabilities, data breaches, security incidents, supply-side attacks, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components, power outages, natural disasters, hardware failures, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, user malfeasance, computer viruses, unauthorized access, phishing or social engineering attacks, ransomware attacks, denial-of-service attacks and other real or perceived cyberattacks or catastrophic events, all of which may not be prevented by our efforts to secure our computer systems. Any of these incidents could lead to interruptions or shutdowns of our platform, disruptions in our ability to process customer orders or to track, record or analyze the sale of our products, loss or corruption of data or unauthorized access to or acquisition of personal information or other sensitive information, such as our intellectual property. We utilize security tools and controls and also rely on our third-party vendors to use sufficient security measures, including encryption and authentication technology, in an effort to protect personal and other sensitive information. However, advances in computer capabilities, increasingly sophisticated tools and methods used by hackers and cyber terrorists, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in our failure or inability, or the failure or inability of our vendors, to adequately protect personal or other sensitive information and there can be no assurance that we or our vendors will not suffer a cyberattack, that hackers or other unauthorized parties will not gain access to or exfiltrate personal information or other sensitive data, or that any such data compromise or unauthorized access will be discovered in a timely fashion.\nWe rely on associates, contractors and other third parties who may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train associates, pay higher insurance premiums, and engage third-party specialists for additional services. An information security breach involving confidential and personal data could damage our reputation and our customers' willingness to purchase from us. In addition, we may incur material liabilities and remediation costs as a result of an information security breach, including potential liability for stolen customer or associate data, repairing system damage or providing credit monitoring or other benefits to customers or associates affected by the breach. In the event we experience an information security breach, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover the impact to the business. Although we have developed mitigating security controls to reduce our cyber risk and protect our data from loss or disclosure due to a security breach, including processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security.\nWe, and our third-party vendors, regularly experience cyberattacks aimed at disrupting services. Our third-party vendors have been and may be the victim of cyber-related attacks that could lead to operational disruptions that could have an adverse effect on our ability to fulfill customer orders. Security incidents such as ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe, as well as increasingly difficult to detect. We, and our third-party vendors, have been subject to cyber, phishing and social engineering attacks and other security incidents in the past and may continue to be subject to such attacks in the future. Security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent actions by our associates, our third-party vendors or their personnel or other parties. If we or our third-party service providers experience security breaches that result in a decline in marketplace performance, availability problems, or the loss, corruption of, unauthorized access to, or disclosure of personal data or confidential information, people may become unwilling to provide us the information necessary to make purchases on our sites, and our reputation and market position could be harmed. Existing\ncustomers may also decrease their purchases or close their accounts altogether. We could also face potential claims, investigations, regulatory proceedings, liability and litigation, and bear other substantial costs in connection with remediating and otherwise responding to any data security breach, all of which may not be adequately covered by insurance, and which may result in an increase in our costs for insurance or insurance not being available to us on economically feasible terms, or at all. Insurers may also deny us coverage as to any future claim. Any of these results could harm our growth prospects, financial condition, business, and reputation.\nOur failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brands.\nThe value of our brands is largely dependent on the success of our merchandise assortment and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing the reputation and recognition of our banners, particularly DSW, is critical to our ability to expand and retain our customer base. Any negative publicity about us or the significant brands we offer may reduce demand for our merchandise. Failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor, health and safety, accounting, or environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions. In addition, negative claims or publicity, including social media, regarding celebrities we have license and endorsement arrangements with could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate. Consumer actions could include boycotts and negative publicity through social or digital media. Public perception about us or the products we carry, whether justified or not, could impair our reputation, involve us in litigation, damage our brand, and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe value of our brands may also depend on the success of our corporate social responsibility (\"CSR\") and sustainability initiatives, which require company-wide coordination and alignment. Risks associated with these initiatives include any increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, new laws and regulations, increased costs associated with sustainability efforts and/or compliance with laws and regulations, as well as increased pressure to expand our CSR and sustainability disclosures in these areas, make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to such targets and goals. All of the foregoing could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. Any CSR or sustainability metrics that we currently or may in the future disclose, whether based on the standards we set for ourselves or those set by others, may influence our reputation and the value of our brands. There is also increased focus, including by investors, customers, and other stakeholders, on CSR and other sustainability matters, including the use of plastic, energy, waste, and worker safety. Our reputation could be damaged if we do not, or are perceived to not, act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nThe reputation and competitive position of our Brand Portfolio segment is dependent on our ability to maintain the brands we license.\nIn partnership with Authentic Brands Group LLC, a global brand management and marketing company, we formed ABG-Camuto, a joint venture in which we have a 40% interest. This joint venture acquired several intellectual property rights, including Vince Camuto, Louise et Cie, and others, and focuses on licensing and developing new category extensions to support the global growth of these brands. ABG-Camuto has entered into a licensing agreement with us, which will earn royalties from the net sales of Camuto Group under the brands acquired. In addition, we own footwear, and in some cases handbag, licensing rights of Jessica Simpson, Lucky Brand, and, through a joint venture, JLO Jennifer Lopez.\nWe rely on our ability to retain and maintain good relationships with the licensors and their ability to maintain strong, well-recognized brands and trademarks. The terms of our license agreements vary and are subject to renewal with various termination provisions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these licenses. Even our longer-term or renewable licenses are typically dependent upon our ability to market and sell the licensed products at specified levels, and our failure to meet such levels may result in the termination or non-renewal of such licenses. Furthermore, many of our license agreements require minimum royalty payments, and if we are unable to generate sufficient sales and profitability to cover these minimum royalty requirements, we may be required to make additional payments to the licensors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur ABL Revolver has restrictions that could limit our ability to fund operations, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe ABL Revolver contains a minimum availability covenant where an event of default shall occur if availability is less than the greater of $30.0 million or 10.0% of the maximum credit amount. In addition, the ABL Revolver contains customary covenants restricting our activities, including limitations on the ability to sell assets, engage in acquisitions, enter into transactions involving related parties, incur additional debt, grant liens on assets, pay dividends, or repurchase stock, and make certain other changes. There are specific exceptions to these covenants including, in some cases, upon satisfying specified payment conditions. The ABL Revolver contains customary events of default. Upon an event of default that is not cured or waived within the cure periods, in addition to other remedies that may be available to the lenders, the obligations may be accelerated, outstanding letters of credit may be required to be cash collateralized and remedies may be exercised against the collateral.\nWe use the ABL Revolver for borrowings and to secure letters of credit, both of which reduce the amount of available credit. The actual amount that is available under the ABL Revolver fluctuates, due to factors including, but not limited to, eligible inventory and credit card receivables, reserve amounts, outstanding letters of credit, and outstanding borrowings. Consequently, it is possible that, should we need to access any additional funds from our ABL Revolver, it may not be available in full.\nRISKS RELATING TO EXTERNAL FACTORS\nWe may be unable to compete in our highly competitive market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe footwear market is highly competitive with few barriers to entry. We compete against a diverse group of manufacturers and retailers, including department stores, mall-based shoe stores, national chains, independent shoe retailers, single-brand specialty retailers, online shoe retailers, brand-oriented discounters, multi-channel specialty retailers, and brand suppliers. In addition, our wholesale retailer customers sell shoes purchased from competing footwear suppliers with owned and licensed brands that are well known. Our success depends on our ability to remain competitive with respect to assortment, quality, convenience, and value. The performance of our competitors, as well as a change in their pricing policies as a result of the current economic environment, marketing activities, and other business strategies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nE-commerce networks have rapidly evolved while consumer receptiveness to shopping online has substantially increased. Competition from e-commerce players has significantly increased due to their ability to provide improved user experience, greater ease of buying goods, low or no shipping fees, faster shipping times, and more favorable return policies. Businesses, including our suppliers, can easily launch online sites and mobile platforms at nominal costs by using commercially available software or partnering with any of a number of successful digital marketplace providers. Some of our suppliers use such platforms to compete with us by allowing consumers to purchase products directly through the supplier. Competitors with other revenue sources may also be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, and devote more resources to websites, mobile platforms and applications, and systems development.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we are unable to provide our customers with cost-effective shopping platforms that are able to respond and adapt to rapid changes in technology.\nThe number of people who access the Internet through devices other than personal computers, including mobile phones, smartphones, handheld computers such as notebooks and tablets, video game consoles, and television set-top devices, has increased dramatically in the past few years. The smaller screen size, functionality, and memory associated with smartphones, laptops, and tablets may make the use of our sites and purchasing our products more difficult. The versions of our sites developed for these devices and our mobile app may not be compelling to consumers.\nIn addition, it is time consuming and costly to keep pace with rapidly changing and continuously evolving technology. We cannot be certain that our mobile applications or our mobile-optimized sites will be successful in the future. As existing mobile devices and platforms evolve and new mobile devices and platforms are released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in adjusting and developing applications for changes and alternative devices and platforms, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such applications. If we are unable to attract customers to our websites through these devices or are slow to develop versions of our websites that are more compatible with alternative devices or a mobile application, we may fail to capture a significant share of customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurther, we continually upgrade existing technologies and business applications, and we may be required to implement new technologies or business applications in the future. The implementation of upgrades and changes requires significant investments. Our results of operations may be affected by the timing, effectiveness, and costs associated with the successful implementation of any upgrades or changes to our systems and infrastructure. In the event that it is more difficult for our customers to buy products from us on their mobile devices, or if our customers choose not to buy products from us on their mobile devices or to use mobile products that do not offer access to our websites, our customer growth could be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also are dependent on the interoperability of our sites with popular mobile operating systems that we do not control, such as iOS and Android, and any changes in such systems that degrade the functionality of our sites or mobile app, limit or discontinue our access to a particular platform, or give preferential treatment to competitive products or services, could adversely affect the usage of our sites on mobile devices. We are also subject to the policies and terms of service of the providers of such operating systems and mobile application download stores, which govern the promotion, distribution, content, and operation of our mobile applications. Each provider has broad discretion to change and interpret its terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers, and those changes may be unfavorable to us. Additionally, mobile application download stores have imposed, and are likely to continue imposing, certain privacy-and security-related restrictions and controls on the providers and applications within their marketplaces. For example, Apple released a software update in 2021 that, by default, blocks advertisers from tracking certain mobile device activity unless affirmative consent is obtained.\nIn the event that it is more difficult for our customers to access and use our sites on their mobile devices, or if our customers choose not to access or to use our sites on their mobile devices or to use mobile products that do not offer access to our sites, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on foreign sources for our merchandise, and our business is therefore subject to risks associated with international trade.\nWe face risks inherent in purchasing from suppliers with foreign operations, such as: public health threats, including the COVID-19 pandemic; economic and political instability in countries where these suppliers are located; international hostilities or acts of war or terrorism affecting the U.S. or foreign countries from which our merchandise is sourced; increases in shipping costs; transportation delays and interruptions, including increased inspections of import shipments by domestic authorities; work stoppages; expropriation or nationalization; changes in foreign government administration and governmental policies; changes in import duties or quotas; compliance with trade and foreign tax laws; and local business practices, including compliance with foreign laws and with domestic and international labor standards. Such events may increase our costs and disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe require our business partners to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our internal requirements. However, we do not control such third parties or their labor and business practices. The violation of labor or other laws by one of our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we rely on manufacturers that operate outside of North America, including China, Vietnam, and Brazil, who may disclose our intellectual property or other proprietary information to competitors or third parties, which could result in the distribution and sale of counterfeit versions of our products.\nOur international operations expose us to political, economic, operational, compliance, and other risks.\nWe have international operations in various locations, including China, Canada, and Brazil. The success of our international operations may be adversely affected by political, economic, and social conditions beyond our control, local laws and customs, and legal and regulatory constraints, including compliance with applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, labor, and currency laws and regulations. Risks inherent in our existing and future operations also include, among others, public health threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the cost and difficulties of managing operations outside of the U.S., possible adverse tax consequences from changes in tax laws or the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits, and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may negatively impact our financial results. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nVaccine mandates and other governmental regulations relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business, operations, and results of operations.\nOn September 9, 2021, President Biden announced a proposed rule requiring that all employers with at least 100 employees require that their employees be fully vaccinated or tested weekly (the \"vaccine mandate\"). The U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") issued an emergency temporary standard regulation to carry out this mandate. On January 26, 2022, OSHA withdrew the emergency temporary standard regulation, ending the vaccine mandate. At this time, it remains unclear whether OSHA will try to enact similar mandates in the future. As a result, we may be required to implement a requirement that all of our associates or certain of our associates get vaccinated or regularly tested for COVID-19. At this time, it is not possible to predict the impact that a vaccine mandate and any other related measures, or a vaccine requirement should we adopt one, will have on us. Any vaccine requirement put in place may result in employee attrition and impact our ability to recruit new talent, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing privacy laws, regulations, and standards as well as policies, contracts, and other obligations related to data privacy and security. Our failure to comply with privacy laws and regulations, as well as other legal obligations, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nState, federal, and foreign governments are increasingly enacting laws and regulations governing the collection, use, retention, sharing, transfer, and security of personally identifiable information and data. A variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, orders, rules, codes, regulatory guidance and certain industry standards regarding privacy, data protection, consumer protection, information security and the processing of personal information and other data apply to our business. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\"CCPA\"), which took effect on January 1, 2020, imposes certain restrictions and disclosure obligations on businesses that collect personal information about California residents and provides for a private right of action, as well as penalties for noncompliance. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations and creates a private right of action for certain data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. It remains unclear how various provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted and enforced. The California Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\"), which was passed in November 2020 and will take effect in January 2023 (with a look-back for certain requirements to January 2022), amends and expands the CCPA and places additional restrictions on the \"sharing\" of personal information for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising. We may be subject to additional privacy regulations in the future, including the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act and the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which regulate the processing of \"personal data\" regarding their respective residents and grants residents certain rights with respect to their personal data. State laws are changing rapidly, and new legislation proposed or enacted in a number of other states imposes, or has the potential to impose, additional obligations on companies that process confidential, sensitive and personal information, and will continue to shape the data privacy environment nationally. The U.S. federal government is also significantly focused on privacy matters.\nWe are subject to other consumer protection laws, including California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act and unfair competition and false advertising laws, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, Canada's Anti-Spam Law, the CCPA, CPRA and other recently enacted consumer data protection laws. Additionally, the regulatory environment is increasingly demanding with frequent new and changing requirements concerning cybersecurity, information security and privacy, which may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Any failure by us or any of our business partners to comply with applicable laws, rules, and regulations may result in investigations or actions against us by governmental entities, private claims and litigation, fines, penalties or other liabilities. Such events may increase our expenses, expose us to liabilities and impair our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWhile we aim to comply with applicable data protection laws and obligations in all material respects, there is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that we have violated such laws and obligations, will be able to successfully defend against such claims, or will not be subject to significant fines and penalties in the event of non-compliance. Additionally, to the extent multiple state-level laws are introduced with inconsistent or conflicting standards and there is no federal law to preempt such laws, compliance with such laws could be difficult and costly to achieve, or impossible to achieve, and we could be subject to fines and penalties in the event of non-compliance.\nLegislative or regulatory initiatives related to climate change could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGreenhouse gases may have an adverse effect on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Such events could have a negative effect on our business. Concern over climate change may result in new or additional legislative and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, which could result in future tax, transportation cost, and utility increases. Moreover, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may impact the productivity of our facilities, the operation of our supply chain, or consumer buying patterns. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUncertainty in future changes to legislation, regulatory reform, or policies, other than those previously discussed, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nLaws, regulations, and policies in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic, political, and other conditions. Such changes, including additional taxes and tariffs, may result in additional costs to our business and could require us to increase prices to our customers or, if unable to do so, result in a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON SHARES\nOur amended articles of incorporation, amended and restated code of regulations, and Ohio state law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Designer Brands Inc. This could adversely affect the value of our common shares.\nOur amended articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue up to 100,000,000 preferred shares and to determine the powers, preferences, privileges, rights, including voting rights, qualifications, limitations, and restrictions on those shares, without any further vote or action by the shareholders. The rights of the holders of our Class A common shares will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred shares that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred shares could have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change in control and could adversely affect the voting power of our common shares.\nIn addition, provisions of our amended articles of incorporation, amended and restated code of regulations, and Ohio law, together or separately, could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control, or limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common shares. Among other things, these provisions establish a staggered board, require a super-majority vote to remove directors, and establish certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders' meetings.\nWe do not expect a trading market for the Company's Class B common shares to develop and, therefore, any investment in the Class B common shares may be effectively illiquid, unless such shares are converted into the Company's Class A common shares.\nThere is currently no public market for the Company's Class B common shares. We do not intend to list the Class B common shares on any securities exchange or any automated quotation system. As a result, there can be no assurance that a secondary market will develop, and we do not expect any market makers to participate in a secondary market. Because the Class B common shares are not listed on a securities exchange or an automated quotation system, it may be difficult to obtain pricing information with respect to the shares. Accordingly, there may be a limited number of buyers if a holder decided to sell its Class B common shares. This may affect the price a holder would receive upon such sale. Alternatively, a holder of such shares could convert them into Class A common shares, on a share for share basis, prior to selling. However, such conversion could affect the timing of any such sale, which may in turn affect the price a holder may receive upon such sale.\nEntities owned by or controlled by Jay L. Schottenstein, the Executive Chairman of the Designer Brands Inc. Board of Directors, and members of his family (the \"Schottenstein Affiliates\") directly control or substantially influence the outcome of matters submitted for Designer Brands Inc. shareholder votes, and their interests may differ from other shareholders.\nAs of January 29, 2022, the Schottenstein Affiliates have approximately 54% of the voting power of the Company's outstanding common shares. The Schottenstein Affiliates directly control or substantially influence the outcome of matters submitted to Designer Brands Inc.'s shareholders for approval, including the election of directors, approval of mergers or other business combinations, and acquisitions or dispositions of assets. The interests of the Schottenstein Affiliates may differ from or be opposed to the interests of other shareholders, and their level of ownership and voting power in the Company may have the effect of delaying or preventing a subsequent change in control that may be favored by other shareholders.\nThe Schottenstein Affiliates engage in a variety of businesses, including, but not limited to, business and inventory liquidations, apparel companies, and real estate investments. Opportunities may arise in the area of potential competitive business activities that may be attractive to the Schottenstein Affiliates and us. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that the Schottenstein Affiliates are under no obligation to communicate or offer any corporate opportunity to us. In addition, the Schottenstein Affiliates have the right to engage in similar activities as us, do business with our suppliers and customers, and, except as limited by agreement, employ or otherwise engage any of our officers or associates.\nFurthermore, as a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") rules, the Company qualifies for and, in the future, may opt to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements, including having a majority of independent directors, as well as having nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees composed entirely of independent directors.", "PERMNO": 90751, "SIC": 5661, "TIC": "DBI"}
