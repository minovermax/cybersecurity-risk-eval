{"cik": "887226", "company": "PERCEPTRON INC/MI", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-09-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A:\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our Common Stock involves numerous risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the following information about these risks. Any of the risks described below could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our future results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that adversely affect our business in the future. We believe that the most significant of the risks and uncertainties we face are as follows:\nThe Merger is subject to receipt of approval from our shareholders as well as the satisfaction of other closing conditions in the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger Agreement contains a number of conditions to completion of the Merger, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by a majority of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. In addition, the consummation of the Merger is also subject to certain other customary closing conditions as follows: (i) no provision of any applicable law or regulation and no judgment, injunction, order or decree shall prohibit the consummation of the Merger upon the terms contemplated in the Merger Agreement, (ii) any applicable waiting period under the Antitrust Laws (as defined in the Merger Agreement) relating to the Merger shall have expired or been terminated and any approval, clearance, notice or decision approving or not prohibiting the Merger or terminating further investigation of the Merger under the Antitrust Laws relating to the Merger shall have been obtained, (iii) the CFIUS Approval (as defined in the Merger Agreement) shall have been obtained, (iv) the absence of a material adverse effect on the Company and (v) other customary closing conditions, including the accuracy of the other party\u2019s representations and warranties, and the other party\u2019s compliance with its covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement (subject in the case of this clause (v) to certain materiality qualifiers). The obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing condition or the receipt of any financing by the Parent. We can provide no assurance that all required approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), or as to the timing of such approvals or the satisfaction (or waiver, if applicable) of such conditions. Certain of the conditions to completion of the Merger are not within either our or the Parent\u2019s control, and neither we nor Parent can predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable).\nFailure to complete the Merger could materially adversely affect our stock price, future business operations and financial results.\nIf the Merger is not completed for any reason, our shareholders will not receive the Merger Consideration. Instead, we will remain an independent public company, and the shares of our Common Stock will continue to be traded on the Nasdaq. Moreover, our ongoing business may be materially adversely affected, and we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nWe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including potentially significant negative impacts on our stock price\n\u2022\nWe may experience negative publicity, which could have an adverse effect on our ongoing operations including, but not limited to, retaining and attracting employees, partners, customers, and others with whom we do business\n\u2022\nWe will still be required to pay certain significant costs relating to the Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, printing, and other professional services fees, which may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than in connection with the Merger\n\u2022\nWe may be required to pay a cash termination fee as required under the Merger Agreement\n\u2022\nThe Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business, which may have delayed or prevented us from undertaking business opportunities that, absent the Merger Agreement, we may have pursued\n\u2022\nMatters relating to the Merger require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which may have resulted and could continue to result in the distraction of management from ongoing business operations and pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us\n\u2022\nWe may be required to commit time and resources to defending against enforcement proceedings commenced against us related to the Merger\nIf the Merger is not consummated, the risks described above may materialize, and they may have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial results, and stock price.\nShareholder litigation challenging the proposed Merger may prevent the Merger from being completed within the anticipated timeframe.\nShareholder litigation challenging the proposed Merger may be commenced against us and may delay completion of the Merger in the expected timeframe or altogether. If the plaintiffs in any such litigation are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the parties from consummating the Merger on the terms contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the injunction may prevent the completion of the Merger in the expected timeframe or altogether. In addition, litigation challenging the Merger may result in significant defense costs and serve as a distraction to management and directors.\nWe are subject to certain restrictions in the Merger Agreement that may hinder operations pending the consummation of the Merger.\nWhether or not it is completed, the pending Merger may disrupt our current plans and operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. The Merger Agreement generally requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice pending completion of the Merger, and it also restricts us from taking certain actions with respect to our business and financial affairs, subject to certain exceptions. These restrictions could be in place for an extended period of time, including if the consummation of the Merger is delayed more than expected, which may delay or prevent us from undertaking business opportunities that, absent the Merger Agreement, we might have pursued, or from effectively responding to competitive pressures or industry developments. For these and other reasons, the pendency of the Merger could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, we may, under certain circumstances, be obligated to pay a termination fee to Parent. These costs could require us to use cash that would have otherwise been available for other uses.\nIf the Merger is not completed, under specified circumstances, we will be required to pay Parent a termination fee. The termination fee payable by us to Parent of $2,100,000 is payable if the Merger Agreement is validly terminated in connection with certain specified circumstances, including if (i) the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement (as defined in the Merger Agreement) with respect to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (ii) the Board makes an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the Company or any of its subsidiaries enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, the Company fails to recommend in the proxy statement that the shareholders of the Company approve the Merger Agreement, the Company breaches certain negative and affirmative covenants in the Merger Agreement relating to solicitation or other offers or the Company breaches certain covenants regarding the preparation and filing of proxy materials and the holding of a shareholders meeting to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, and (iii) subject to certain conditions, (A) an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) shall have been made publicly or announced to the Company or otherwise made to the Board which Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn prior to termination of the Merger Agreement, (B) the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with certain provisions of the Merger Agreement and (C) within nine (9) months following the date of such termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company shall have entered into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (which Alternative Acquisition Agreement shall later be consummated whether or not within such nine-month period) or consummated a transaction related to any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the same as the original Acquisition Proposal made, communicated or publicly disclosed). If the Merger Agreement is terminated, any termination fee we may be required to pay under the Merger Agreement may require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes or other uses. For these and other reasons, termination of the Merger Agreement could materially adversely affect our business operations and financial results, which in turn would materially and adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt our business, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global health crisis with widespread economic implications. In North America, Europe, Asia and Brazil (our primary markets), federal, state and local governments have recommended or mandated actions to slow the transmission of COVID-19. These actions include the implementation of shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, significant restrictions on travel, and restrictions that prohibit non-essential employees from occupying their place of work. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to spread and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of the virus. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility in the global economy and financial markets, resulting in a significant reduction in both economic activity and employment levels. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, the global automotive industry, resulting in significantly lower sales and production volumes. The spread of COVID-19 has disrupted the manufacturing, delivery and overall supply chain of automobile manufacturers and suppliers. We, along with many of our customers and suppliers, temporarily closed or limited operations at production facilities, the impact of which is likely to negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. Further, negative financial results, an economic downturn or uncertainty, or a tightening of credit markets caused by COVID-19 or other similar outbreaks could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, our ability to effectively meet our short- and long-term financial obligations, and our accounting estimates. Any further delays in resumption of production and other consumer activity affecting our customers and any future wave of COVID-19 or other similar outbreaks could further adversely affect our business. Our order volumes may be volatile, creating the need for us to manage our suppliers, while continuing to ensure a continued supply of component parts for our products. We have implemented new measures that modify our current production environment to ensure continued health and safety of our workers, consistent with guidance provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other governmental bodies. If we are unsuccessful adapting and managing our production to respond to these requirements or recommend actions, our results of operations could be materially impacted. The ultimate impact that COVID-19 will have on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition will depend on a number of evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken by governments and our customers and suppliers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic activity. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the other factors described above make it more difficult for us to forecast customer requirements and provide guidance on our future results. Accordingly, any guidance we provide is likely to be less reliable than usual, and actual results are more likely to differ from any such guidance. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.\nWe have adopted or modified, and will continue to adopt additional, business and workforce practices (including those related to employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) and protocols, including those to promote social distancing and enhance sanitary measures in our facilities, to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by governmental and regulatory authorities. If a large proportion of our employees in critical positions were to contract COVID-19 or be quarantined as a result of the virus, at the same time, we would rely upon our business continuity plans in an effort to continue operations. There is no certainty that the foregoing measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, in which case our employees or other individuals may become sick, our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed, and we may be unable to respond to some of the needs of our global business. Further, our increased reliance on remote access to our information systems increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity breaches.\nWe may become subject to claims or lawsuits by employees, customers, suppliers or other parties regarding actions we take in our operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a borrower under the Paycheck Protection Program our eligibility for and forgiveness of that loan is likely to be reviewed by the SBA.\nOn April 16, 2020, we entered into an unsecured loan with a bank in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $2.5 million pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program, (the \u201cPPP\u201d), under Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d). In connection with this loan, we were required to certify that \u201ccurrent economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the Applicant.\u201d On April 23, 2020, the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) issued new guidance that questioned whether a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets would qualify to participate in the PPP. The SBA guidance further indicates that borrowers \u201cmust make this certification in good faith, taking into account their current business activity and their ability to access other sources of liquidity sufficient to support their ongoing operations in a manner that is not significantly detrimental to the business.\u201d Subsequently, on April 29, 2020 the SBA issued guidance that it will review all PPP loans of more than $2 million, following the lender\u2019s submission of the borrower\u2019s loan forgiveness application. Under PPP, a portion of the PPP Loan is eligible for forgiveness if we were eligible for the PPP Loan, use the loan proceeds for eligible expenses and otherwise satisfy PPP requirements. While we believe we are eligible for the PPP Loan, in the event it was determined that we were not eligible for the PPP Loan, it is possible we would be required to repay the PPP Loan on an accelerated basis, rather than over two years provided under the PPP Loan promissory note, and at a higher interest rate than 1.000% per annum. If we were to be audited and receive an adverse finding in such audit, some or all of the PPP Loan might not be forgiven and we could be required to return or repay some or all of the PPP Loan, together with interest on the loan, which could reduce our liquidity, and potentially subject us to fines and penalties.\nA significant percentage of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers, so that the loss or material change in strategy of any one of these customers could result in a significant reduction in our revenues and profits.\nA majority of our revenue in fiscal 2020 was derived from the sale of systems and solutions to a small number of customers that consist primarily of automotive manufacturers and suppliers in North America, Western Europe and Asia.\nWith such a large percentage of our revenues coming from such a small and highly concentrated group of customers, we are susceptible to a substantial risk of losing revenues if these customers stop purchasing our products or reduce their purchases of our products. In addition, we have no control over whether these customers will continue to purchase our products, systems and solutions in volumes or at prices sufficient to generate profits for us.\nBecause a large portion of our revenues are generated from a limited number of sizeable orders, our revenues and profits may vary widely from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nA large portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of sizeable orders that are placed by a small number of customers. If the timing of these orders is delayed from one quarter to the next or from one year to the next, we may experience fluctuations in our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results.\nThe amount of revenues that we earn in any given quarter may vary based in part on the timing of new vehicle programs in the global automotive industry. In contrast, many of our operating expenses are fixed and will not vary from quarter to quarter. As a result, our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year.\nOur future commercial success depends upon our ability to maintain a competitive technological position in our markets, which are characterized by continual technological change.\nTechnology plays a key role in the systems and solutions that we produce. The ability to sell our products to customers is directly influenced by the technology used in our systems and solutions. With the rapid pace at which technology is changing, there is a possibility that our customers may require more technologically advanced systems and solutions than we may be capable of producing.\nTechnological developments could render our actual and proposed products or technologies as uneconomical or obsolete. There is also a possibility that we may not be able to keep pace with our competitors\u2019 products. In that case, our competitors may make technological improvements to their products that make them more desirable than our products.\nOur growth and future financial performance depend upon our ability to introduce new products and enhance existing products that include the latest technological advances and customer requirements. We may not be able to introduce new products successfully or achieve market acceptance for such products. Any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences, or any significant delays in product development or introduction, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Accordingly, we believe that our future commercial success will depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce new cost-effective products and maintain a competitive technological position.\nWe may need replacement or additional financing in the future to meet our operational needs, including working capital or capital expenditures and such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, if at all, and may be dilutive to existing shareholders.\nOur credit facilities in the U.S. and Brazil are on-demand facilities and may be cancelled by either party at any time. We may need to seek additional financing for our general corporate purposes. For example, we may need to increase our investment in research and development activities or need funds to support working capital or capital expenditure needs. We may be unable to obtain any desired replacement or additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our operations, successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect our business. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our shareholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to further limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants.\nOur future success is dependent upon our ability to implement our long-term growth strategy.\nOur future success is dependent upon our ability to implement our long-term strategy, which includes growing our customer base in the automotive market and expanding into new markets. However, there are a number of uncertainties involved in our long-term strategy over which we have no or limited control, including:\n\u2022\nThe quality and cost of competitive products already in existence or developed in the future\n\u2022\nThe level of interest that existing and potential new customers may have in our existing and new products and technologies\n\u2022\nOur ability to resolve technical issues inherent in the development of new products and technologies\n\u2022\nOur ability to identify and satisfy market needs\n\u2022\nOur ability to identify satisfactory distribution networks\n\u2022\nGeneral product development and commercialization difficulties\n\u2022\nRapid or unexpected technological changes\n\u2022\nGeneral product demand and market acceptance risks\n\u2022\nOur ability to successfully compete with alternative and similar technologies\n\u2022\nOur ability to attract and retain the appropriate personnel to effectively develop, manufacture, represent, install and service our products\n\u2022\nThe effect of economic conditions\nEven if we are able to expand our customer base and markets, the new revenues we derive may not offset declines in revenues from our current products. We also may not be able to generate profits from these new customers or markets at the same level as we generate from our current business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to expand our customer base and markets or successfully execute our strategies in a fashion to maintain or increase our revenues and profits.\nWe are dependent on proprietary technology. If our competitors develop competing products that violate our intellectual property rights or successfully challenge those rights, our revenues and profits may be adversely affected.\nOur products contain features that are protected by patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and contractual rights. Despite these protections, there is still a chance that competitors may use these protected features in their products as a result of our inability to keep our trade secrets confidential, or in violation of our intellectual property rights or following a successful challenge to those rights. The prosecution of infringement claims against third parties and the defense of legal actions challenging our intellectual property rights could be costly and require significant attention from management. Because of the small size of our management team, this could result in the diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations.\nIt is possible that competitors may develop technology that performs the same functions as our products without infringing upon our exclusive rights or may reverse engineer those features of our products that are not protected by patents, trademarks and trade secrets. If a competitor is able to develop such technology or reverse engineer an unprotected feature successfully, the competitor may introduce similar products to compete with our products.\nBecause our products are sold globally, we are at risk of competitors misappropriating our intellectual property included in those products or reverse engineering those products. As a result, we may have a more limited ability, and significantly greater costs, to enforce our intellectual property rights in those products. Constant technological improvement of those products will be particularly important to keep our products competitive in their markets.\nThere are a number of companies offering competitive products in our markets, or developing products to compete with our products, which could result in a reduction in our revenues through lost sales or a reduction in prices.\nWe are aware of a number of companies in our markets selling products using similar or alternative technologies and methods. We believe that there may be other companies which may be engaged in the development of technology and products for some of our markets that could prove to be competitive with ours. Some of these companies are substantially larger and have significantly greater resources than us. We believe that the principal competitive factor in our markets is the total capability that a product offers. In some markets, a competitive price for the level of functionality and reliability provided are the principal competitive factors. While we believe that our products compete favorably, it is possible that these competitors could capture some of our sales opportunities or force us to reduce prices in order to complete the sale.\nWe believe that certain existing and potential customers may be capable of internally developing their own technology. This could cause a decline in sales of our products to those customers.\nWe have operations outside the United States, increasing the possibility that our business could be adversely affected by risks of doing business in foreign countries.\nWe have significant operations outside of the United States.\nOur foreign operations are subject to risks customarily encountered in such operations. For instance, we may encounter fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, differences in the level of protection available for our intellectual property, the impact of differences in language and local business and social customs on our ability to market and sell our products in these markets, the inability to recruit qualified personnel in a specific country or region, more stringent employment regulations and local labor conditions and difficulties in repatriating cash earned in other countries back to the U.S. In addition, we may be affected by U.S. laws and policies that impact foreign trade and investment. Finally, we may be adversely affected by laws and policies imposed by foreign governments in the countries where we have business operations or sell our products.\nOur revenues are highly influenced by the sale of products for use in the global automotive market, particularly by manufacturers based in the United States, China and Western Europe. These manufacturers have experienced periodic downturns in their businesses that could adversely affect their level of purchases of our products.\nDue to our significant revenue from the automotive industry, our ability to sell our systems and solutions to automotive manufacturers and suppliers is affected by periodic downturns in the global automotive industry, such as what occurred in 2009-2010 and what is occurring now because of the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nNew vehicle tooling programs are the most important selling opportunity for our automotive-related sales. The number and timing of new vehicle tooling programs can be influenced by a number of economic factors. Our customers only launch a limited number of new car programs in any given year because of the time and financial resources required. From a macro perspective, we continue to assess the global economy and its likely effect on our automotive customers and markets served. We continue to view the automotive industry\u2019s focus on introducing new vehicles more frequently, including producing more electronic vehicles and starting to introduce autonomous vehicles to satisfy their customers\u2019 changing requirements, as well as their continuing focus on improved quality, as positive indicators for new business. However, because of periodic economic downturns experienced by our customers, our customers could decide to reduce their number of new car programs. The automobile industry is a very cost competitive industry. Pricing pressures could adversely affect the margins we realize on the sale of our products, and ultimately, our profitability.\nA significant amount of our assets represent intangible assets, and our net income would be reduced if our intangible assets become further impaired.\nIntangible assets relate primarily to software developed by us and are subject to an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of the intangible asset might not be recoverable. If we determine that any intangible assets or goodwill is impaired, we would be required to take a related charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have recorded impairment charges in the past primarily relating to goodwill and net intangibles assets balances of our CMM reporting unit. As of June 30, 2020, after giving effect to these impairment charges, we had $1.1 million of net intangible assets. Any future impairment of these assets could require, material non-cash charges to our results of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price and on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to increase sales of our CMM products depends on our ability to successfully expand our distribution channels.\nWith the acquisitions of Coord3 and NMS in fiscal 2015, we expanded our product lines to include the design, manufacture and sale of CMM products. We market our line of CMM products directly to end users and through distributors and resellers. Growth of our sales of this product line depends upon our ability to expand our distribution channels by identifying, developing and maintaining relationships with distributors and resellers. In addition, our distributors and resellers can potentially sell products offered by our competitors. If we are not able to successfully expand our distribution channels for our CMM products, or if our distributors or resellers do not or are not able to successfully sell our CMM products, our revenues from CMM products will be adversely affected.\nGlobal economic conditions may negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur revenue levels are impacted by global economic conditions, as we have a significant business in many countries throughout the world. In fiscal 2020, only 32% of our sales were generated in North America and as a result, a significant decline in global economic conditions, such as we are experiencing with the COVID-19 Pandemic, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nBecause of our significant foreign operations, our revenues and profits can vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in the value of the United States Dollar against other currencies.\nProducts that we sell in foreign markets are typically priced in the currency of the country where the customer is located. To the extent that the U.S. Dollar fluctuates against these currencies, the costs of our products sold in those countries\u2019 currencies also will fluctuate. As a result, revenue and profits on the sale of our products could vary based on these fluctuations. Accordingly, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses in our profits that could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nIn addition, because a significant portion of our assets are denominated in foreign currencies, we face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. These fluctuations have, in the past, resulted in material adverse foreign currency translations adjustments to our comprehensive net income/loss as well as had a material negative impact on our reported levels of cash and cash equivalents.\nIf the suppliers and subcontractors we rely on for component parts or products delay deliveries, fail to deliver parts or products meeting our requirements or stop supplying parts or products altogether, we may not be able to deliver products to our customers in a timely fashion and our revenues and profits could be reduced.\nWe rely on subcontractors for certain components of our products, including outside subcontracting assembly houses to produce the circuit boards that we use in our products. As a result, we have limited control over the quality and the delivery schedules of components or products purchased from third parties. In addition, we purchase a number of component parts from single source suppliers. If our supplies of component parts or products meeting our requirements are significantly delayed or interrupted, including due to impacts from the COVID-19 Pandemic, or our subcontractors choose to terminate their supply contracts, we may not be able to deliver products to our customers in a timely fashion. This could result in a reduction in revenues and profits for these periods. The termination of or material change in the purchase terms of any single source supplier could have a similar impact on us. It is also possible, if our delay in delivering products to our customer is too long, the customer could cancel their order or potentially charge us with penalties, resulting in a permanent loss of revenue and/or profit from that sale. Although we have not experienced significant supply shortages from single source suppliers in recent years, from time to time, we have experienced significant delays in the receipt of certain components. Finally, although we believe that alternative suppliers are available for the components in our products, difficulties or delays may arise if we shift manufacturing capacity to new suppliers.\nThe occurrence of business system disruptions or information security breaches could adversely affect our business.\nMany companies have experienced material information security breaches caused by illegal hacking, computer viruses or acts of vandalism or terrorism. While we have implemented security measures to protect against such breaches, it is possible that our security measures may not detect or prevent such breaches. Any such compromise to our information security could result in an interruption in our operations, the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, the unauthorized release of customer, vendor, or employee data, the violation of privacy or other laws, monetary losses and the exposure to litigation, any of which could harm our business and operating results. A disruption to our management information systems could cause significant disruption to our business, including our ability to receive and ship orders, receive and process payments and timely report our financial results. Any disruption occurring with these systems may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities, which could change our effective tax rate and have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, including Germany, Italy and China. In determining our provisions for income taxes, we make judgments regarding various tax positions reported on our tax returns. As a result, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our tax returns are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Because of these uncertain tax positions, the final determination of these tax audits could be materially different than is reflected in our financial statements and could have a material adverse effect on our provisions for income taxes, results of operations or cash flows.\nA number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates, such as the future valuation of our deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the U.S., which can vary significantly, positively or negatively, depending on future periods of taxable income or taxable losses in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income and the various tax rates in those countries, changes in available tax credits, and changes in tax laws and rates. A change in our effective tax rate can adversely impact our net income.\nWe face various risks arising from the legal, regulatory and tax requirements imposed on our operations in the various countries in which we conduct our business operations.\nWe are subject to various risks relating to our compliance with existing and new laws, rules and regulations implemented in the countries in which we conduct our business operations, including anti-corruption, anti-bribery, tax, material composition of our products, such as restrictions on lead and other substances, environmental, safety and export control regulations.\nWe are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or other benefits. As a result of our foreign operations, we may have contact with persons who are considered foreign officials under the FCPA, putting us at an increased risk of potential FCPA violations.\nOur failure or inability to comply with any of these laws, rules or regulations could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures or financial or regulatory obligations that may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, reputation or ability to conduct business. We may receive audit notices or other inquiries from governmental or regulatory authorities, and we may participate in voluntary disclosure programs, related to legal, regulatory or tax compliance matters. These audits, inquiries or disclosure programs or any non-compliance with applicable laws, rules or regulations could result in our incurring material expense, including investigation costs, defense costs, assessments and penalties, or other consequences that could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, reputation or ability to conduct business.\nWe are subject to risks related to the ongoing trade disputes, including those between the United States and China.\nThe U.S. has imposed significant increases in tariffs on certain imports, which has prompted retaliatory measures from major U.S. trading partners, principally China. To date, increased tariffs have increased the cost of certain products we sell in China, causing customers in China to postpone decisions about purchasing new capital goods. Such tariffs could increase our costs to purchase components used in our products. Our earnings and sales have been, and could be in the future, negatively affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere and further increases of import tariffs. A prolonged trade war might cause a decrease in our sales, operating income and net earnings.\nWe may not be able to complete business opportunities and our profits could be negatively affected if we do not successfully integrate those that we do complete.\nWe will evaluate, from time to time, business opportunities that fit our strategic plans. There can be no assurance that we will identify any opportunities that fit our strategic plans or be able to enter into agreements with identified business opportunities on terms acceptable to us. We may incur significant development and other costs with no assurance that a business opportunity will be realized after incurring these costs.\nWe intend to finance any such business opportunities from available cash on hand, existing credit facilities, issuance of additional stock or additional sources of financing, as circumstances warrant. The issuance of additional equity securities to finance business opportunities could be substantially dilutive to our current stockholders. In addition, if the business opportunities do not perform as expected, we could incur charges with no future benefits. If we are not successful in generating additional profits from these items, this dilution and these additional costs could cause our Common Stock price to drop.\nFailure to comply with U.S. federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy or data protection, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new laws or regulations relating to privacy or data protection, could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nA variety of U.S. federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data. Laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. These requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices. As a result, our practices may not have complied or may not comply in the future with all such laws, regulations, requirements and obligations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any federal, state or international privacy or data protection related laws, regulations, industry self-regulatory principles, industry standards or codes of conduct, regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject or other legal obligations relating to privacy or data protection could adversely affect our reputation and business, and may result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities or require us to change our operations and/or cease using certain data sets. Any such claim, proceeding or action could hurt our reputation and business, force us to incur significant expenses in defense of such proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, result in a loss of customers and suppliers and may result in the imposition of monetary penalties. We may also be contractually required to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations or other legal obligations relating to privacy or data protection or any inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure of data that we store or handle as part of operating our business.\nForeign data protection, privacy and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the U.S. The European Union, for example, traditionally has imposed stricter obligations under its laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection than the U.S., most recently adopting the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) throughout Europe in May 2018. Individual European Union member countries have discretion with respect to their interpretation and implementation of these laws and the penalties for breach and have their own regulators with differing attitudes towards enforcement, which results in varying privacy standards and enforcement risk from country to country.\nWe are subject to risks related to litigation.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to lawsuits and other claims arising out of our business operations. Adverse judgments in one or more of these lawsuits could require us to pay significant damage amounts. The outcome of lawsuits is inherently uncertain and typically a loss cannot be reasonably estimated or accrued by us. Accordingly, if the outcome of a legal proceeding is adverse to us, we would have to record a charge for the matter at the time the legal proceeding is resolved and generally in the full amount at which it is resolved. In addition, the expenses related to these lawsuits may be significant. Lawsuits can have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results, particularly where we have not established an accrual or a sufficient accrual for damages, settlements or expenses. See \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d and Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies - Litigation and Other Contingencies\u201d below for a discussion of our policies in accounting for lawsuits and other claims.\nWe could become involved in costly litigation alleging patent infringement.\nIn the past, we had been informed that certain of our customers have received allegations of possible patent infringement involving processes and methods used in our products. Certain of these customers, including a customer who was a party to a patent infringement suit relating to this matter, settled such claims. We believe that the processes used in our products were independently developed without utilizing any previous patented process or technology. It is possible, however, that in the future, we or our customers could receive allegations of possible patent infringement or could be parties to patent infringement litigation relating to our products.\nThe defense of patent infringement litigation could be costly and require significant attention from management. Because of the small size of our management team, this could result in the diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations or could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur success depends in large part upon the continued service of our executives and key employees, including those in engineering, software engineering, sales and marketing positions, as well as our ability to attract such additional employees in the future. At times and in certain geographic markets, competition for the type of highly skilled employees we require can be significant. The loss of key personnel or the inability to attract new qualified key employees could adversely affect our ability to implement our long-term growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBecause of the limited trading in our Common Stock, it may be difficult for shareholders to dispose of a large number of shares of our Common Stock in a short period of time or at then current prices.\nBecause of the limited number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding and the limited number of holders of our Common Stock, only a limited number of shares of our Common Stock trade on a daily basis. This limited trading in our Common Stock makes it difficult to dispose of a large number of shares in a short period of time. In addition, it is possible that the sale by a shareholder of a large number of shares of our Common Stock over an extended period would depress the price of our Common Stock.\nThe trading price of our stock has been volatile.\nThe following factors may affect the market price of our Common Stock, which can vary widely over time:\n\u2022\nvariances in our operating results\n\u2022\nannouncements by our largest customers that have a significant impact on their operations\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products by us\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products by our competitors\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the electronic and sensing industry and/or automotive industry\n\u2022\nmarket conditions and stock prices in general\n\u2022\nthe volume of our Common Stock traded\n\u2022\ndisruptive trading activity or practices impacting the stock markets generally or our Common Stock in particular\nMarket volatility adversely impacts the market price of our Common Stock.\nThe capital and credit markets are subject to volatility and disruption. During such a period, the volatility and disruption could reach unprecedented levels, which would exert downward pressures on stock prices, including the market price of our Common Stock.\nThe Board of Directors has the right to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock without further action by shareholders. The issuance of those shares could cause the market price of our Common Stock to drop significantly and could be used to prevent or frustrate shareholders\u2019 attempts to replace or remove current management.\nAlthough no preferred stock currently is outstanding, we are authorized to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the Board of Directors, without further action by shareholders, and may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), the dividends payable thereon, liquidation payments, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion rights and redemption rights. In the event that preferred stock is issued, the rights of the common stockholders may be adversely affected. This could result in a reduction in the value of our Common Stock.\nThe preferred stock could be issued to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control. This may be beneficial to our management or Board of Directors in a hostile tender offer or other takeover attempt and may have an adverse impact on shareholders who may want to participate in the tender offer or who favor the takeover attempt.\nOur rights plan could be used to discourage hostile tender offers.\nWe maintain a rights plan. Under the plan, if any person acquires 20% or more of our outstanding Common Stock, our shareholders, other than the acquirer, will have the right to purchase shares of our Common Stock at half their market price. The rights plan discourages potential acquirers from initiating tender offers for our Common Stock without the approval of the Board of Directors. This may be beneficial to our management or Board of Directors in a hostile tender offer or other takeover attempt and may have an adverse impact on shareholders who may want to participate in the tender offer or who favor the takeover attempt.\nIf management is not able to provide a positive report on our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting, shareholders and others may lose confidence in our financial statements, which could cause our stock price to drop.\nWe are required by SEC rules to include a report of management on our disclosure controls in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in our annual reports on Form 10-K and internal controls over financial reporting in our annual reports on Form 10-K.\nDuring the course of the external audit of our fiscal 2019 financial statements, a material weakness was identified regarding the inadequate design and operation of internal controls related to income tax accounting. We enhanced our internal controls during fiscal 2020 to remediate this control deficiency as of June 30, 2020. In the event we identify other material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal controls that we cannot remediate in a timely manner, investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. This could cause our stock price to drop.", "PERMNO": 77868, "SIC": 3827, "TIC": "PRCP"}
