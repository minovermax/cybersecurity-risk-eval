{"cik": "1578732", "company": "Marcus & Millichap, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risk factors and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making any investment decisions regarding our securities. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nOverview\nWe are impacted by and manage many risk factors detailed below affecting our business including External Business Risks, Human Resource and Personnel Risks, Internal Business Risks, and Risks related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock. Many of these factors described below in External Business Risk, are outside of our control. In addition, we are a personnel and relationship intensive business rather than a capital intensive business. While all the risk factors discussed below have the potential to negatively impact our business, the most significant risks facing the Company are the general economic conditions and commercial real estate market conditions risk and our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced managers and investment sales and financing professionals.\nExternal Business Risks\nGeneral economic conditions and commercial real estate market conditions have had and may in the future have a negative impact on our business.\nWe may be negatively impacted by periods of economic downturns, recessions and disruptions in the capital markets; credit and liquidity issues in the capital markets, including international, national, regional and local markets; and corresponding declines in the demand for commercial real estate investment and related services. Historically, commercial real estate markets and, in particular, the U.S. commercial real estate market, have tended to be cyclical and related to the flow of capital to the sector, the condition of the economy as a whole and to the perceptions and confidence of the market participants as to the relevant economic outlook. Cycles in the real estate markets may lead to similar cycles in our earnings and significant volatility in our stock price. Further real estate markets may \u201clag\u201d behind the broader economy such that even when underlying economic fundamentals improve in a given market, additional time may be required for these improvements to translate into strength in the real estate markets. The \u201clag\u201d may be exacerbated when banks delay their resolution of commercial real estate assets whose values are less than their associated loans.\nNegative economic conditions, changes in interest rates, credit and liquidity issues in the capital markets, disruptions in capital markets and/or declines in the demand for commercial real estate investment and related services in international and domestic markets or in significant markets in which we do business, have had and could have in the future a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. In particular, the commercial real estate market is directly impacted by (i) the lack of debt and/or equity for commercial real estate transactions, (ii) increased interest rates and changes in monetary policies by the U.S Federal Reserve, (iii) changes in the perception that commercial real estate is an accepted asset class for portfolio diversification, and (iv) slowdowns in economic activity that could cause residential and commercial tenant demand to decline, which would adversely affect the operation and income of commercial real estate properties.\nThese and other types of events could lead to a decline in transaction activity as well as a decrease in values which, in turn, would likely lead to a reduction in brokerage commissions and financing fees relating to such transactions. These effects would likely cause us to realize lower revenues from our transaction service fees, including investment sales commissions, which fees usually are tied to the transaction value and are payable upon the successful completion of a particular transaction. Such declines in transaction activity and value would likely also significantly reduce our financing activities and revenues. For example, the disruptions and\ndislocations in the global credit markets during 2008 and 2009 created significant restrictions in the availability of credit, especially on transitional assets and in the secondary and tertiary markets. In turn, the volume and pace of commercial real estate transactions were significantly reduced, as were property values, which generally peaked in 2007 and fell through 2010.\nFiscal uncertainty, significant changes and volatility in the financial markets and business environment and similar significant changes in the global, political, security and competitive landscape, make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our revenue and earnings into the future. As a result, any revenue or earnings guidance or outlook which we may give may be affected by such events or may otherwise turn out to be inaccurate.\nIn addition, the Trump administration\u2019s prospective modifications to fiscal, monetary and regulatory policies could have significant implications for investors in commercial real estate and our business. Such modifications could significantly affect our business, but the effects are unknown at this time.\nWe have numerous significant competitors and potential future competitors, some of which may have greater resources than we do, and we may not be able to continue to compete effectively.\nWe compete in investment sales and financing within the commercial real estate industry. Our investment sales focus is on the private client market segment, which is highly fragmented. The fragmentation of our market makes it challenging to effectively gain market share. While we have a competitive advantage over other national firms in the private client market segment, we also face competition from local and regional service providers who have existing relationships with potential clients. Furthermore, transactions in the private client market segment are smaller than many other commercial real estate transactions. Although the brokerage commissions in this segment are generally a higher percentage of the sales price, the smaller size of the transactions requires us to close many more transactions to sustain revenues. If the commission structure or the velocity of transactions were to change, we could be disproportionately affected by changes compared to other companies that focus on larger transactions, institutional clients and other segments of the commercial real estate market.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively, maintain our current fee arrangements with our private clients, maintain current margin levels or counteract increased competition. The services we provide to our clients are highly competitive on a national, regional and local level. Depending on the geography, property type or service, we face competition from, including, but not limited to, commercial real estate service providers, in-house real estate departments, private owners and developers, commercial mortgage servicers, institutional lenders, research and consulting firms, and investment managers, some of whom are clients and many of whom may have greater financial resources than we do. In addition, future changes in laws and regulations could lead to the entry of other competitors. Many of our competitors are local, regional or national firms. Although most are substantially smaller than we are, some of these competitors are larger on a local, regional or national basis, and we believe more national firms are exploring entry into or expansion in the $1-$10 million private client market segment. We may face increased competition from even stronger competitors in the future due to a trend toward acquisitions and consolidation. We are also subject to competition from other large national and multi-national firms as well as regional and local firms that have similar service competencies to ours. Our existing and future competitors may choose to undercut our fees, increase the levels of compensation they are willing to pay to their employees and investment sales and financing professionals, and either recruit our employees and investment sales and financing professionals or cause us to increase our level of compensation necessary to retain employees or investment sales and financing professionals, or recruit new employees or investment sales and financing professionals. These occurrences could cause our revenue to decrease, and/or expenses to increase which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur brokerage operations are subject to geographic and commercial real estate market risks, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur real estate brokerage offices are located in and around large metropolitan areas as well as mid-market regions throughout the United States and Canada. Local and regional economic conditions in these locations\ncould differ materially from prevailing conditions in other parts of the country. We realize more of our revenues in California. In 2016, we earned approximately 35% in California. In particular, as a result of this concentration, we are subject to risks related to the California economy and real estate markets more than in other geographic markets. In addition to economic conditions, this geographic concentration means that California-specific legislation, taxes and regional disasters, such as earthquakes, could disproportionately affect us. A downturn in investment real estate demand or economic conditions in these regions could result in a further decline in our total gross commission income and profitability and have a material adverse effect on us.\nSeasonal fluctuations and other market data in the investment real estate industry could adversely affect our business and make comparisons of our quarterly results difficult.\nOur revenue and profits have historically tended to be significantly higher in the second half of each year than in the first half of the year. This is a result of a general focus in the real estate industry on completing or documenting transactions by calendar year end and because certain expenses are constant throughout the year. Historically, we have reported relatively lower earnings in the first quarter and then increasingly larger earnings during each of the following three quarters. This historical trend can be disrupted both positively and negatively by major economic or political events impacting investor sentiment for a particular property type or location, current and future projections of interest rates, attractiveness of other asset classes, market liquidity and the extent of limitations or availability of capital allocations for larger institutional buyers, to name a few. As a result, our historical pattern of seasonality may or may not continue to the same degree experienced in the prior years and may make it difficult to determine during the course of the year whether planned results will be achieved, and thus to adjust to changes in expectations.\nA change in the tax laws relating to like-kind exchanges could adversely affect our business and the value of our stock.\nSection 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), provides for tax-free exchanges of real property for other real property. Legislation has been proposed on several occasions that would repeal or restrict the application of Section 1031. If tax-free exchanges under Section 1031 were to be limited or unavailable, our clients or prospective clients may decide not to purchase or sell property that they would have otherwise purchased or sold due to the tax consequences of the transaction, thus reducing the commissions we would have otherwise received. Any repeal or significant change in the tax rules pertaining to like-kind exchanges could have a substantial adverse impact on our business and the value of our stock.\nA change in the tax laws could adversely affect our business and value of our stock.\nThe Code and state and local tax codes contain numerous provisions, regulations and interpretations. We operate in numerous states and cities in the United States and in Canada and are exposed to the risk of complying with those tax codes. Further, changes in tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate may impact taxes we are required to pay and our ability to transact business in the jurisdictions. Further, such changes may make operating in these jurisdictions unprofitable and may unfavorably impact our results of operations and ability to execute our growth plans. The Trump administration and key members of Congress have made public statements indicating that tax reform is a priority for 2017. Certain changes to U.S. tax laws, such as changes in corporate tax rates could have an impact to our business, but the effects are unknown at this time.\nIn addition, changes in tax laws can impact investors\u2019 perceived value of real estate, timing of transactions and perception of real estate as favorable investment. As a result, such changes may increase or decrease investors\u2019 desire to engage in real estate transactions, which could have an unfavorable impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Internet could devalue our information services and lead to reduced client relationships, which could reduce the demand for our services.\nThe dynamic nature of the Internet, which has substantially increased the availability and transparency of information relating to commercial real estate listings and transactions, could change the way commercial real estate transactions are done. This has occurred to some extent in the residential real estate market as online brokerage and/or auction companies have eroded part of the market for traditional residential real estate brokerage firms. The proliferation of large amounts of data on the Internet could also devalue the information that we gather and disseminate as part of our business model and may harm certain aspects of our investment brokerage business in the event that principals of transactions prefer to transact directly with each other. The rapid dissemination and increasing transparency of information, particularly for public companies, increases the risks to our business that could result from negative media or announcements about ethics lapses or other operational problems, which could lead clients to terminate or reduce their relationships with us.\nOur businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof. If we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us, including in our role as a real estate broker or mortgage broker, we may incur significant financial penalties.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign regulations specific to the services we perform in our business, as well as laws of broader applicability, such as tax, securities and employment laws. In general, the brokerage of real estate transactions requires us to maintain applicable licenses where we perform these services. If we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license, or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses, we may be required to pay fines (including treble damages in certain states) or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked. We could also be subject to disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nOur business is also governed by various laws and regulations, limiting the manner in which prospective clients may be contacted, including federal and state \u201cDo Not Call\u201d and \u201cDo Not Fax\u201d regulations. We may be subject to legal claims and governmental action if we are perceived to be acting in violation of these laws and regulations. We may also be subject to claims to the extent individual employees or investment sales and financing professionals breach or fail to adhere to company policies and practices designed to maintain compliance with these laws and regulations. The penalties for violating these laws and regulations, can be material, and could result in changes in which we are able to contact prospective clients.\nAs the size and scope of commercial real estate transactions have increased significantly during the past several years, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing regimes and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased. New or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business, both within and outside of the United States, as well as changes in administrations or enforcement priorities may have an adverse effect on our business. Such new or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business may impact transaction volumes and values, increase the costs of compliance or prevent us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or clients. We are unable to predict how any of these new laws, rules, regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Risks of legislative changes are inherent each time a new federal administration takes office, and the impact of any new or revised legislation or regulations under the Trump administration is unknown. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHuman Resource and Personnel Risks\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified and experienced managers, investment sales and financing professionals, our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer.\nOur most important asset is people, and our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our managers and investment sales and financing professionals. If these managers or investment sales and financing professionals depart, we will lose the substantial time and resources we have invested in training and developing those individuals and our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Additionally, such departures may have a disproportionate adverse effect on our operations if our most experienced investment sales and financing professionals do not remain with us or if departures occur in geographic areas where substantial amounts of our real estate brokerage commissions and financing fee revenues are generated.\nOur competitors may attempt to recruit our investment sales and financing professionals or commission structures may change in the market place. For a variety of reasons, the exclusive independent contractor arrangements we have entered into or may enter into with sales professionals may not prevent these investment sales professionals from departing and competing against us or our commission compensation maybe relatively less attractive to our investment sales and financing professionals. We currently do not have employment agreements with most key employees, and there is no assurance that we will be able to retain their services.\nAn increasing component of our growth has also occurred through the recruiting, training and retention of key experienced investment sales and financing professionals. Any future growth through attracting these types of professionals will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of qualified candidates fitting the culture of our firm at reasonable terms and conditions. However, individuals whom we would like to recruit or retain may not agree to terms and conditions acceptable to us. In addition, the recruiting of new personnel involves risks that the persons acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of persons recruited will prove incorrect.\nIf we lose the services of our executive officers or certain other members of our senior management team, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur success depends in a large part upon the continued service of our senior management team, who are important to our vision, strategic direction and culture. Our current long-term business strategy was developed in large part by our senior-level officers and depends in part on their skills and knowledge to implement, and also includes a focus on new growth and investment initiatives that may require additional management expertise to successfully execute our strategy. We may not be able to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of our senior management or other key officers or employees or be able to recruit additional or replacement talent.\nOur business could be hurt if we are unable to retain our business philosophy and culture of information-sharing and efforts to retain our philosophy and culture could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our business.\nOur policy of information-sharing, matching properties with large pools of investors and the emphasis that we place on our clients, our people and our culture defines our business philosophy and differentiates our services. Various factors could adversely affect this culture. If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our changing enterprise and maintain this culture, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe concentration of sales among our top investment sales and financing professionals could lead to losses if we are unable to retain them.\nOur most successful investment sales and financing professionals are responsible for a significant percentage of our revenues. They also serve as mentors and role models, and provide invaluable training for\nyounger professionals, which is an integral part of our culture. This concentration among our top investment sales and financing professionals of real estate brokerage commissions and financing fees revenues can lead to greater and more concentrated risk of loss if we are unable to retain them, and could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. Furthermore, many of our investment sales and financing professionals work in teams. If a team leader or manager leaves our Company, his or her team members may leave with the team leader.\nMost of our sales professionals are independent contractors, not employees, and if laws, regulations or rulings mandate that they be employees, our business would be adversely impacted.\nMost of our investment sales professionals are retained as independent contractors, and we are subject to the Internal Revenue Service regulations and applicable state law guidelines regarding independent contractor classification. These regulations and guidelines are subject to judicial and agency interpretation, and it could be determined that the independent contractor classification is inapplicable to some or all of our investment sales professionals. Further, if legal standards for classification of these investment sales professionals as independent contractors change or appear to be changing, it may be necessary to modify our compensation structure for these investment sales professionals in some or all of our markets, including paying additional compensation or reimbursing expenses. If we are forced to classify these investment sales professionals as employees, we would also become subject to laws regarding employee classification and compensation, and to claims regarding overtime, minimum wage, and meal and rest periods. We could also incur substantial costs, penalties and damages due to future challenges by current or former investment sales professionals to our classification or compensation practices. Any of these outcomes could result in substantial costs to us, could significantly impair our financial condition and our ability to conduct our business as we choose, and could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract clients and investment sales and financing professionals.\nFraud, or theft, which is difficult to detect and deter, could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subjecting us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.\nIf our employees or investment sales and financing professionals engage in misconduct, our business could be adversely affected. It is not always possible to deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to deter and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. If our employees or investment sales and financing professionals were to engage in unethical business practices, improperly use, disseminate, fail to disseminate or disclose information provided by our clients, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions, suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and current client relationships and significantly impair our ability to attract future clients. These events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. To the extent any fraud or theft of funds or misconduct result in losses that exceeds our insurance coverage, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nInternal Business Risks\nWe may fail to successfully differentiate our brand from those of our competitors, which could adversely affect our revenues.\nThe value of our brand and reputation is one of our most important assets. An inherent risk in maintaining our brand is we may fail to successfully differentiate the scope and quality of our service and product offerings from those of our competitors, or we may fail to sufficiently innovate or develop improved products or services that will be attractive to our clients. Additionally, given the rigors of the competitive marketplace in which we operate, there is the risk we may not be able to continue to find ways to operate more productively and more cost-effectively, including by achieving economies of scale, or we will be limited in our ability to further reduce the costs required to operate on a nationally coordinated platform.\nOur attempts to expand our services and businesses may not be successful and we may expend significant resources without corresponding returns.\nWe intend to expand our specialty groups, particularly multi-tenant retail, office, industrial and hospitality, as well as various niche segments, including multifamily tax credit, affordable housing, student housing, manufactured housing, seniors housing and self-storage. We also plan to grow our financing services provided through our subsidiary, Marcus & Millichap Capital Corporation. We expect to incur expenses relating to recruitment, training, and expanding our markets and services. The planned expansion of services and platforms requires significant resources, and there can be no assurance we will compete effectively, attract or train a sufficient number of professionals to support the expansion, or operate these businesses profitably. We may incur significant expenses for these plans without corresponding returns, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we experience significant growth in the future, such growth may be difficult to sustain and may place significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources.\nIf we experience significant growth in the future, such growth could place additional demands on our resources and increase our expenses, as we will have to commit additional management, operational and financial resources to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion. There can be no assurance we will be able to manage our expanding operations effectively or we will be able to maintain or accelerate our growth, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and control our expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we may have to delay, alter or eliminate the implementation of certain aspects of our growth strategy due to events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, changes in general economic conditions and commercial real estate market conditions. Such delays or changes to our growth strategy may adversely affect our business.\nA majority of our revenue is derived from transaction fees, which are not long-term contracted sources of revenue and are subject to external economic conditions, and declines in those engagements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe historically have earned principally all of our revenue from real estate brokerage transactions and financing fees. We expect that we will continue to rely heavily on revenue from real estate brokerage transactions and financing fees for substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future. A decline in number of transactions completed or in the value of the commercial real estate we sell could significantly decrease our revenues which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to retain existing clients and develop new clients, our financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe are substantially dependent on long-term client relationships and on revenue received for services provided for them. Our listing agreements generally expire within six months and depend on the cooperation of the client during the pendency of the agreement, as is typical in the industry. In this competitive market, if we are unable to maintain these relationships or are otherwise unable to retain existing clients and develop new clients, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Historically, a global economic downturn and weaknesses in the markets in which our clients and potential clients compete have led to a lower volume of transactions and fewer real estate clients generally, which makes it more difficult to maintain existing and establish new client relationships. These effects could increase again in the wake of the continuing political and economic uncertainties in the United States and in other countries.\nIf we do not respond to technological changes or upgrade our technology systems, our growth prospects and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality, features and security of our technology infrastructure. Infrastructure upgrades may require significant capital investment outside of the normal course of business. In the future, we will likely need to improve and upgrade our technology, database systems and network infrastructure in order to allow our business to grow in both size and scope. Without such improvements, our operations might suffer from unanticipated system disruptions, slow performance or unreliable service levels, any of which could negatively affect our ability to provide rapid customer service. We may face significant delays in introducing new services, investment sales professional tools and enhancements. If competitors introduce new products and services using new technologies, our proprietary technology and systems may become less competitive, and our business may be harmed. In addition, the expansion and improvement of our systems and infrastructure may require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources, with no assurance that our business will improve.\nInterruption, unauthorized breaches, or failure of our information technology, communications systems or data services could hurt our ability to effectively provide our services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.\nOur business requires the continued operation of information technology and communication systems and network infrastructure. Our ability to conduct our national business may be adversely impacted by disruptions or breaches to these systems or infrastructure. Our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or disruption from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, system malfunctions, computer viruses, third-party misconduct or penetration and criminal acts, natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, acts of war or terrorism, or other events which are beyond our control. In addition, the operation and maintenance of these systems and networks is, in some cases, dependent on third-party technologies, systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data or intellectual property (such as our client lists and information, business methods and research) and may also disrupt our ability to provide services to or interact with our clients, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel. We have disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected. Our business relies significantly on the use of commercial real estate data. We produce much of this data internally, but a significant portion is purchased from third-party providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability. A disruption of our ability to provide data to our professionals and/or clients could damage our reputation, and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nFailure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks, including personally identifiable and client information could adversely affect us.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property, and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our employees and contractors, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. A significant actual or potential theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of client, employee or other personally identifiable data, whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal\nobligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant costs, fines, litigation or regulatory actions against us. Such an event could additionally disrupt our operations and the services we provide to clients, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our services, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. Additionally, we increasingly rely on third-party data storage providers, including cloud storage solution providers, resulting in less direct control over our data. Such third parties may also be vulnerable to security breaches and compromised security systems, which could adversely affect our reputation.\nIn addition, we rely on the collection and use of personally identifiable information from clients to conduct our business. We disclose our information collection and dissemination practices in a published privacy statement on our websites, which we may modify from time to time. We may be subject to legal claims, government action, including under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), and damage to our reputation if we act or are perceived to be acting inconsistently with the terms of our privacy statement, client expectations or the law. In the event we or the vendors with which we contract to provide services on behalf of our clients were to suffer a breach of personally identifiable information, our customers could terminate their business with us. Further, we may be subject to claims to the extent individual employees or investment sales and financing professionals breach or fail to adhere to company policies and practices and such actions jeopardize any personally identifiable information. In addition, concern among potential buyers or sellers about our privacy practices could keep them from using our services or require us to incur significant expense to alter our business practices or educate them about how we use personally identifiable information.\nFailure to appropriately deal with actual or perceived conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses.\nOutside of our employees and investment sales and financing professionals, our reputation is one of our most important assets. As we have expanded the scope of our services, we increasingly have to address potential, actual or perceived conflicts of interest relating to the services we provide to our existing and potential clients. For example, conflicts may arise between our position as an advisor to both the buyer and seller in commercial real estate sales transactions or in instances when a potential buyer requests that we represent them in securing the necessary capital to acquire an asset we are selling for another client or when a capital source takes an adverse action against an owner client that we are advising in another matter. From time to time, we also advise or represent entities and parties affiliated with us in commercial real estate transactions which also involve clients unaffiliated with us. In this context, we may be subject to complaints or claims of a conflict of interest. While we believe we have attempted to adopt various policies, controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts, these policies and procedures may not be adequate or carry attendant costs and may not be adhered to by our employees. Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to gain new clients if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we acquire companies or recruit significant groups of personnel in the future, we may experience high transaction and integration costs, the integration process may be disruptive to our business and the acquired businesses and/or personnel may not perform as expected.\nOur growth strategy may include the future acquisition of companies and/or recruitment of people and may involve significant transaction-related expenses. Transaction-related expenditures include severance costs, lease termination costs, transaction costs, deferred financing costs, possible regulatory costs and merger-related costs, among others. We may also experience difficulties in integrating operations and accounting systems acquired from other companies. These challenges include the diversion of management\u2019s attention from the regular operations of our business and the potential loss of our key clients, our key associates or those of the acquired operations, each of which could harm our financial condition and results of operation. We believe some acquisitions could initially have an adverse impact on revenues, expenses, operating income and net income.\nAcquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating people, information technology, accounting, reporting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels. If we are unable to fully integrate the accounting, reporting and other systems of the businesses we acquire, we may not be able to effectively manage them and our financial results may be materially affected. Moreover, the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business as it requires coordination of culture, people and geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems.\nIn addition, acquisitions of businesses involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations, that the expected synergies associated with acquisitions will not be achieved and that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of the people and the businesses acquired will prove incorrect, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may face significant liabilities and/or damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity.\nAs a licensed real estate broker, we and our licensed professionals and brokers are subject to regulatory due diligence, disclosure and standard-of-care obligations. The actual or perceived failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our professionals and brokers to litigation from parties who attempted to or in fact financed, purchased or sold properties that we or they brokered, managed or had some other involvement. We could become subject to claims by those who either wished to participate or did participate in real estate transactions alleging that we did not fulfill our regulatory, contractual or other legal obligations. We also face potential conflicts of interest claims when we represent both the buyer and the seller in a transaction.\nWe depend on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain clients. As a result, allegations by private litigants or regulators, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us or our investment activities, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and damage our business prospects. In addition, if any lawsuits were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability, it could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could materially impact our business.\nSome of these litigation risks may be mitigated by the commercial insurance we maintain in amounts we believe are appropriate. However, in the event of a substantial loss, our commercial insurance coverage and/or self-insurance reserve levels might not be sufficient to pay the full damages, or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain types of claims. Further, the value of otherwise valid claims we hold under insurance policies could become uncollectible in the event of the covering insurance company\u2019s insolvency, although we seek to limit this risk by placing our commercial insurance only with highly-rated companies. Any of these events could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and for as long as we continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to; (i) not being required to have our independent registered public accounting firm audit our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in the internal control over financial reporting go undetected; (ii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our company; and (iii) exemptions from the\nrequirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe could remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, although if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as of the following December 31. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe have irrevocably elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, and therefore, we are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d\nWe are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. These internal controls may or may not be subject to auditor attestation, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our Company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis. However, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating. Our remediation efforts may not enable us to avoid a material weakness in the future. In addition, to comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff.\nOur investments in marketable securities are subject to certain risks which could affect our overall financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe invest a portion of our available cash and cash equivalent balances in money market funds, some of which have floating net asset values or by purchasing marketable securities with maturities in excess of three months in a managed portfolio in a variety of fixed and variable rate debt securities, including U.S. government and federal agency securities and corporate debt securities. The primary objective of our investment activity is to maintain the safety of principal, provide for future liquidity requirements while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. Should any of our investments or marketable securities lose value or have their liquidity impaired, it could affect the Company\u2019s overall financial condition. Additionally, should we choose to sell these securities in the future, our consolidated operating results or cash flows may be affected.\nWe may be deemed to be an investment company due to our investments in marketable securities and, if such a determination were made, we would become subject to significant regulation that would adversely affect our business.\nWe may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 if, among other things, we own \u201cinvestment securities\u201d with a value exceeding 40% of the value of our total assets, unless we qualify under a particular exemption or safe harbor. We invest part of our available cash and cash equivalents\nin variety of short-term, investment grade securities, some of which may qualify as \u201cinvestment securities\u201d under the Investment Company Act. Investment companies are subject to registration under the Investment Company Act and compliance with a variety of restrictions and requirements. If we were to be deemed an investment company we would become subject to these restrictions and requirements, and the consequences of having been an investment company without registering under the Investment Company Act could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as restrict our ability to sell and issue securities, borrow funds, engage in various transactions or other activities and make certain investment decisions. In addition, we may incur significant costs or limitation business opportunities to avoid investment company status if an exemption from the Investment Company Act were to be considered unavailable to us at a time when the value of our \u201cinvestment securities\u201d exceeds 40% of the value of our total assets. We believe that we satisfy the conditions to be exempt from the Investment Company Act because, among other things, we are engaged directly and primarily in a business other than that of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities. However, absent an exemptive order from the SEC, our status of being exempt cannot be assured.\nRisks related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur Co-Chairman and founder controls a significant interest in our stock, and the concentrated ownership of our common stock may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant decisions.\nGeorge M. Marcus, our Co-Chairman and founder beneficially owns approximately 55% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2016. Because Mr. Marcus controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, he is able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors, so long as he controls a significant portion of our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent shareholders from being able to sell shares of our common stock at or above the price shareholders paid for them. The market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including quarterly and annual variations in our results and those of our competitors; changes to the competitive landscape; estimates and projections by the investment community; the arrival or departure of key personnel, especially the retirement or departure of key senior investment sales and financing professionals and management; the introduction of new services by us or our competitors; acquisitions, strategic alliances or joint ventures involving us or our competitors; and general global and domestic economic, credit and liquidity issues, market or political conditions. For example, in 2015 and 2016, the price of our shares has ranged from a high of $53.92 per share to a low of $18.77.\nAs a result of these factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price paid to acquire the stock or may not be able to resell them at all. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low.\nIf our Co-Chairman sells a controlling interest in our Company to a third party in a private transaction, you may not realize any change-of-control premium on shares of our common stock and we may become subject to the control of a presently unknown third party.\nOur Co-Chairman and controlling stockholder has the ability, should he choose to do so, to sell some or all of the shares of our common stock that he controls in a private transaction, which, if sufficient in size, could result in a change of control of our Company. The ability of our Co-Chairman and controlling stockholder to privately sell the shares of our common stock that he controls, with no requirement for a concurrent offer to be made to acquire all of our common stock that will be publicly traded hereafter, could prevent shareholders from realizing any change-of-control premium on shares of our common stock that may otherwise accrue to entities\ncontrolled by our Co-Chairman on a private sale of our common stock. If entities controlled by our Co-Chairman privately sell a significant equity interest in our Company, we may become subject to the control of a presently unknown third party. Such third party may have conflicts of interest with those of other stockholders. Furthermore, if our Co-Chairman sells a controlling interest in our Company to a third party, our commercial agreements and relationships could be impacted, all of which may adversely affect our ability to run our business as described herein and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nTwo of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with MMC.\nGeorge M. Marcus and William A. Millichap serve as co-chairmen of our board of directors and are also directors of MMC. In addition, Mr. Marcus beneficially owns most of the outstanding stock of MMC. Their position at MMC and the ownership of any MMC equity or equity awards creates, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors are faced with decisions that could have different implications for MMC than the decisions have for us.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our Company or our sector, or we do not meet expectations of the analysts the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. These research reports about our business may contain information about the Company, including but not limited to estimates of our future results of operations and stock price. We do not control these analysts, nor can we assure that any analysts will continue to follow us, issue research reports or publish information that accurately predicts our actual results or stock price. Furthermore, if we do not meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrades our Company or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, the price of our common stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our Company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nSignificant fluctuations in our revenues and net income may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly or an annual basis, which may make the comparison between periods difficult and may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience fluctuations in revenues and net income as a result of many factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, capital market disruptions, the timing of transactions, revenue mix and the timing of additional selling, general and administrative expenses to support growth initiatives. We provide many of our services pursuant to contracts that typically expire within six months and that are dependent on the client\u2019s cooperation. Consequently, many of our clients can terminate or significantly reduce their relationships with us on very short notice for any reason.\nWe plan our capital and operating expenditures based on our expectations of future revenues and, if revenues are below expectations in any given quarter or year, we may be unable to adjust capital or operating expenditures in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall, which could have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nFuture sales or the perception of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of shares of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were approximately 22.4 million shares of our common stock outstanding, which could be registered and sold in a private or public sale. The majority of these shares are beneficially owned by entities controlled by George M. Marcus our Co-Chairman. Future sales, the lifting of common stock resale restrictions that will expire over the next two years, issuances of shares under our 2013 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan and 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan or the availability of a substantial amount of our\ncommon stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the future sales of equity securities.\nWe may issue shares of our common stock or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares of our common stock, or the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial. We may also grant registration rights covering those shares of our common stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances or sales of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares of our common stock issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14213, "SIC": 6531, "TIC": "MMI"}
