RISK FACTORS\nThere are many risks and uncertainties that can affect our future business, financial performance or share price. Many of these are beyond our control. A description follows of some of the important factors that could have a material negative impact on our future business, operating results, financial condition or share price. This discussion includes a number of forward-looking statements. You should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in the first paragraph under Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Investments in Real Estate and the U.S. Energy Infrastructure Sector\nThe majority of our infrastructure real property assets are leased to a single tenant.\nThe Pinedale LGS represented approximately 47 percent of our total assets as of December 31, 2014 and the lease payments under the Pinedale Lease Agreement with Ultra Wyoming represented approximately 50 percent of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. Ultra Wyoming or Ultra Petroleum, one of the guarantors of Ultra Wyoming\u2019s obligations under the Pinedale Lease Agreement and Ultra Wyoming\u2019s ultimate parent company, may experience a downturn in its business, which may weaken its financial condition and result in Ultra Wyoming\u2019s failure to make timely lease payments or give rise to default under the Pinedale Lease Agreement or Ultra Petroleum\u2019s failure to meet its related parent guaranty obligations. In the event of a default by Ultra Wyoming or Ultra Petroleum, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment. In addition, if Ultra Wyoming fails to renew the Pinedale Lease Agreement and we cannot find a new lessee at the same or better lease rates, the expiration of the Pinedale Lease Agreement in 2027 could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nThe following is a brief summary of certain risk factors disclosed by Ultra Petroleum in its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which should be carefully considered before you decide to invest in shares of our common stock. For a complete discussion of the risks that may be applicable to Ultra Petroleum, please review its complete Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014.\n\u2022\nUltra Petroleum\u2019s reserve estimates may turn out to be incorrect if the assumptions upon which these estimates are based are inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of Ultra Petroleum\u2019s reserves.\n\u2022\nCompetitive industry conditions may negatively affect Ultra Petroleum\u2019s ability to conduct operations.\n\u2022\nFactors beyond Ultra Petroleum\u2019s control affect its ability to effectively market production and may ultimately affect its financial results.\n\u2022\nA decrease in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect Ultra Petroleum\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nA substantial portion of Ultra Petroleum's reserves and production is natural gas. Prices for natural gas have been lower in recent years than at various times in the past and may remain lower in the future. Sustained low prices for natural gas may adversely affect Ultra Petroleum's operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nSustained low prices for oil may adversely affect Ultra Petroleum\u2019s operations and financial condition. Most of the production from its Uinta Basin properties is crude oil.\n\u2022\nCompliance with environmental and other governmental regulations could be costly and could negatively impact Ultra Petroleum\u2019s production.\n\u2022\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and gas that Ultra Petroleum produces.\n\u2022\nPotential physical effects of climate change could adversely affect Ultra Petroleum\u2019s operations and cause it to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\n\u2022\nCyber-attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may adversely impact Ultra Petroleum\u2019s operations.\n\u2022\nUltra Petroleum may not be able to replace its reserves or generate cash flows if it is unable to raise capital. Ultra Petroleum will be required to make substantial capital expenditures to develop its existing reserves and to discover new oil and natural gas reserves.\n\u2022\nUltra Petroleum\u2019s operations may be interrupted by severe weather or drilling restrictions.\n\u2022\nUltra Petroleum is exposed to operating hazards and uninsured risks that could adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nIf oil and gas prices decrease, Ultra Petroleum may be required to record additional write downs of the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties.\nWe are subject to the risk of Ultra Wyoming transferring its obligations under the Pinedale Lease Agreement.\nThe terms of the Pinedale Lease Agreement provide that Ultra Wyoming may transfer its rights and obligations under the Pinedale Lease Agreement at any time, subject to certain conditions. We thus bear the risk that Ultra Wyoming will transfer its rights and obligations under the Pinedale Lease Agreement to a third party whose creditworthiness may not be on par with that of Ultra Wyoming, which could inhibit such transferee\u2019s ability to make timely lease payments under the Pinedale Lease Agreement or increase the likelihood that a downturn in the business of such transferee could give rise to a default under the Pinedale Lease Agreement. The occurrence of either of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nThe terms of the co-investment in Pinedale LP may limit our ability to take certain actions in the future.\nPinedale GP, our wholly-owned subsidiary, is the general partner of Pinedale LP. Under the Pinedale LP partnership agreement, Pinedale GP is given broad authority to manage the affairs of Pinedale LP and to ensure that Pinedale LP complies with the terms of various agreements to which it is a party, including the Pinedale Lease Agreement and the credit agreement with KeyBank. The Pinedale LP partnership agreement, however, requires the approval of the holder of a majority of a class of limited partner interests (all of which are currently held by Prudential) before certain actions can be taken by Pinedale LP, including granting any consent under the Pinedale Lease Agreement to: extend the term of the Pinedale Lease Agreement; change the methodology of determining the rent; improve the leased property; reduce the present value of rental payments; merge with, or acquire unrelated assets from, a third party; incur debt, or amend the terms of any existing Pinedale LP debt, that would increase that debt above a specified amount; or issue partnership interests with rights superior to those held initially by Prudential. The approval of one or more of the foregoing matters may not be obtained at a time when we believe that an action requiring approval should be taken.\nThe financial condition of Arc Terminals and Arc Logistics and the ability and willingness of each to satisfy its obligations under the Portland Lease Agreement and the related parent guaranty will have a material impact on our results of operation, ability to service our indebtedness and ability to make distributions.\nArc Terminals, or Arc Logistics, the guarantor of Arc Terminals\u2019 obligations under the Portland Lease Agreement, may experience a downturn in its business. If Arc Logistics identifies appropriate acquisition candidates, it may be unable to negotiate successfully\nthe terms of the acquisitions, finance them, or integrate the acquired business into its then existing business. Completing an acquisition and integrating an acquired business may require a significant diversion of Arc Terminals\u2019 management time and resources and involve significant costs. If Arc Terminals makes one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration includes cash, Arc Terminals could be required to use a substantial portion of its available cash, or obtain financing, in order to consummate such acquisitions. Any of the above may weaken Arc Terminals\u2019 or Arc Logistics\u2019 financial condition and result in Arc Terminals\u2019 failure to make timely lease payments or give rise to another default under the Portland Lease Agreement or Arc Logistics\u2019 failure to meet its related parent guaranty obligations. Further, Arc Terminals or Arc Logistics could be subject to a bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Title 11 of the bankruptcy laws of the United States.\nIn the event of any of the above by Arc Terminals or Arc Logistics, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment. The financial condition of Arc Terminals and Arc Logistics and the ability and willingness of each to satisfy its obligations under the Portland Lease Agreement and the related parent guaranty will have a material impact on our results of operation, ability to service our indebtedness and ability to make distributions. In addition, if Arc Terminals fails to renew the Portland Lease Agreement and we cannot find a new lessee at the same or better lease rates, the expiration of the Portland Lease Agreement in 2027 could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks involved in single tenant leases.\nWe intend to focus our acquisition activities on real properties that are triple-net leased to single tenants. Therefore, the financial failure of, or other default by, a single tenant under its lease: (i) is likely to cause a significant reduction in the operating cash flow generated by the property leased to that tenant, (ii) might decrease the value of that property, and (iii) will expose us to 100 percent of all applicable operating costs.\nCosts of complying with governmental laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters, may adversely affect our income and the cash available for distribution.\nWe have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in real property assets, which are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety. These laws and regulations generally govern the gathering, storage, handling, and transportation of petroleum and other hazardous substances, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, including wastewater discharges and air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and aboveground storage tanks, the generation, use, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, and the remediation of any contamination associated with such disposals. Environmental laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability on tenants, owners or operators for the costs to investigate or remediate contaminated properties, regardless of fault or whether the acts causing the contamination were legal. This liability could be substantial. Moreover, if one or more of these hazards occur, there can be no assurance that a response will be adequate to limit or reduce any resulting damage. In addition, the presence of hazardous substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell, rent or pledge such property as collateral for future borrowings. We also may be required to comply with various local, state and federal fire, health, life-safety and similar regulations. Specific issues related to significant energy infrastructure assets that we currently own include the following:\n\u2022\nPinedale LGS. Our ownership of the Pinedale LGS subjects us to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to the transmission, storage and distribution of natural gas and natural gas liquids, such as well site blowouts, cratering and explosions, pipe and other equipment and system failures, uncontrolled flows of natural gas or well fluids, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, pollution and environmental risks and natural disasters.\n\u2022\nPortland Terminal Facility. The operations at the Portland Terminal Facility involve the storage and throughput of crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals. Our ownership of the Portland Terminal Facility subjects us to the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to these operations, such as fires, explosions, accidental spills, discharges or other releases of petroleum or hazardous substances into the environment and neighboring areas, disruptions in supply infrastructure or logistics and other equipment failures, pollution and environmental risks and disasters for which we may incur substantial liabilities, including those to investigate and remediate.\n\u2022\nMoGas. In addition to the pipeline safety regulations discussed below, MoGas' operations are subject to extensive federal, regional, state and local environmental laws and regulations including, for example, the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Clean Water Act, CERCLA, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, OPA, OSHA and analogous state laws. These laws and regulations may restrict or impact MoGas' business activities in many ways, including requiring the acquisition of permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities, restricting the manner in which it disposes of wastes, requiring remedial action to remove or mitigate contamination, requiring capital expenditures to comply with pollution control requirements, and imposing substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from its operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal\nenforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. MoGas may be unable to recover some or all of the resulting costs through insurance or increased revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nState and federal laws in this area are constantly evolving, and some environmental laws and regulations have been amended so as to require compliance with new or more stringent standards as of future dates. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may impose material environmental liability and/or require material expenditures by us to avoid such liability. Further, our tenant companies\u2019 operations, the existing condition of land when we buy it, operations in the vicinity of our properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks, or activities of unrelated third parties may affect our properties. We intend to monitor these laws and take commercially reasonable steps to protect ourselves from the impact of these laws, including where deemed necessary, obtaining environmental assessments of properties that we acquire; however, we will not obtain an independent third-party environmental assessment for every property we acquire. In addition, any such assessment that we do obtain may not reveal all environmental liabilities or whether a prior owner of a property created a material environmental condition not known to us.\nFailure to comply with applicable environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal fines or penalties, permit revocations, and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of the operations at our facilities. Any material compliance expenditures, fines, or damages we must pay could materially and adversely affect our business, assets or results of operations and, consequently, would reduce our ability to make distributions.\nA terrorist attack, act of cyber-terrorism or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the U.S., whether or not targeted at our assets or those of our tenants, investees or customers, could adversely affect the U.S. and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. Both we and our tenants and investees could experience loss of business, delays or defaults in payments from customers or disruptions of supplies and markets if domestic and global utilities or other energy infrastructure companies are direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. Additionally, both we and our tenants and other investees rely on financial and operational computer systems to process information critically important for conducting various elements of our respective businesses. Any act of cyber-terrorism or other cyber-attack resulting in a failure of our computer systems, or those of our tenants, customers, suppliers or others with whom we do business, could materially disrupt our ability to operate our respective businesses and could result in a financial loss to the Company and possibly do harm to our reputation. Accordingly, terrorist activities and the threat of potential terrorist activities (including cyber-terrorism) and any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such events also might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets, which could limit our access to capital or increase our cost of obtaining capital.\nSome losses related to our real property assets, including, among others, losses related to potential terrorist activities, may not be covered by insurance and would adversely impact distributions to stockholders.\nOur leases will generally require the tenant companies to carry comprehensive liability and casualty insurance on our properties comparable in amounts and against risks customarily insured against by other companies engaged in similar businesses in the same geographic region as our tenant companies. We believe the required coverage will be of the type, and amount, customarily obtained by an owner of similar properties. However, there are some types of losses, such as catastrophic acts of nature, acts of war or riots, for which we or our tenants cannot obtain insurance at an acceptable cost. If there is an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insurance limits, we could lose both the revenues generated by the affected property and the capital we have invested in the property if our tenant company fails to pay us the casualty value in excess of such insurance limit, if any, or to indemnify us for such loss. This would in turn reduce the amount of income available for distributions. We would, however, remain obligated to repay any secured indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. Since September 11, 2001, the cost of insurance protection against terrorist acts has risen dramatically. The cost of coverage for acts of terrorism is currently mitigated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (\u201cTRIPRA\u201d), which extended such program through December 31, 2020. Under TRIPRA, the amount of terrorism-related insurance losses triggering the federal insurance threshold will be raised gradually from its current level of $100 million in 2014 to $200 million in 2020. Additionally, the bill increases insurers' co-payments for losses exceeding their deductibles, in annual steps, from 15% in 2014 to 20% in 2020. Each of these changes may have the effect of increasing the cost to insure against acts of terrorism for property owners, such as the Company, notwithstanding the other provisions of TRIPRA. Further, if TRIPRA is not continued beyond 2020 or is significantly modified, we may incur higher insurance costs and experience greater difficulty in obtaining insurance that covers terrorist-related damages. Our tenants may also have similar difficulties. There can be no assurance our tenant companies will be able to obtain terrorism insurance coverage, or that any coverage they do obtain will adequately protect our properties against loss from terrorist attack.\nMoGas' natural gas transmission operations are subject to regulation by the FERC.\nMoGas' business operations are subject to regulation by the FERC, including the types and terms of services MoGas may offer to its customers, construction of new facilities, creation, modification or abandonment of services or facilities, recordkeeping and relationships with affiliated companies. Compliance with these requirements can be costly and burdensome and FERC action in any of these areas could adversely affect MoGas' ability to compete for business, construct new facilities, offer new services or recover the full cost of operating its pipelines. This regulatory oversight can result in longer lead times to develop and complete any future project than competitors that are not subject to the FERC\u2019s regulations. We cannot give any assurance regarding the likely future regulations under which MoGas will operate its natural gas transmission business or the effect such regulations could have on MoGas' business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRate regulation could limit MoGas' ability to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines, including a reasonable return.\nThe rates MoGas can charge for its natural gas transmission operations are regulated by the FERC pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (\u201cNGA\u201d). Under the NGA, MoGas may only charge rates that have been determined to be just and reasonable by the FERC and is prohibited from unduly preferring or unreasonably discriminating against any person with respect to its rates or terms and conditions of service. The FERC establishes both the maximum and minimum rates MoGas can charge. The basic elements that the FERC considers are the costs of providing service, the volumes of gas being transported or stored, the rate design, the allocation of costs between services, the capital structure and the rate of return a natural gas company is permitted to earn.\nMoGas may not be able to recover all of its costs through existing or future rates. Proposed rate increases may be challenged by protest and allowed to go into effect subject to refund. Even if a rate increase is permitted by the FERC to become effective, the rate increase may not be adequate. To the extent MoGas' costs increase in an amount greater than its revenues increase, or there is a lag between MoGas' cost increases and its ability to file for and obtain rate increases, MoGas' operating results would be negatively affected.\nMoGas' existing rates may be challenged in a proceeding before FERC. In such a proceeding, the FERC may reduce MoGas' rates if the FERC finds the rates are not just and reasonable or are unduly discriminatory. Any successful challenge against MoGas' rates could have an adverse impact on its future revenues associated with providing transmission services. In addition, future changes to laws, regulations and policies may impair MoGas' ability to recover costs, which could adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations.\nMoGas could be subject to penalties and fines if it fails to comply with FERC regulations.\nShould the FERC find that MoGas has failed to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations, and orders, or with the terms of MoGas' tariffs on file with the FERC, MoGas could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (\u201cEPAct 2005\u201d), the FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA and Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (\u201cNGPA\u201d) to impose penalties for violations of up to $1.0 million per day for each violation, to revoke existing certificate authority and to order disgorgement of profits associated with any violation.\nThe revenues of MoGas' business are generated under contracts that are subject to cancellation on an annual basis.\nSubstantially all of the revenues of MoGas' business are generated under transportation contracts which have an initial term of at least one year and renew automatically on a month-to-month basis, but are subject to cancellation by the customer on 365 days\u2019 notice. If MoGas is unable to succeed in replacing any contracts cancelled by local distribution companies (\u201cLDCs\u201d) or other customers that account for a significant portion of its revenues, or in renegotiating such contracts on terms substantially as favorable as the existing contracts, MoGas could suffer a material reduction in its revenues, financial results and cash flows. The maintenance or replacement of existing contracts with MoGas' customers at rates sufficient to maintain current or projected revenues and cash flows ultimately depends on a number of factors beyond its control, including competition from other pipelines, the proximity of supplies to the markets, and the price of, and demand for, natural gas. In addition, changes in state regulation of LDCs may cause them to exercise their cancellation rights in order to turn back their capacity when the contracts expire. Recently, two key customers have taken steps to negotiate terms other than those to which they first became subject on November 1, 2014 by providing notice of termination to MoGas in accordance with the terms of their contracts.\nMoGas depends on certain key customers for a significant portion of its revenues. The loss of any of these key customers could result in a decline in MoGas' business.\nMoGas relies on certain key customers for a significant portion of its revenues. Laclede Gas, Ameren Energy and Omega Pipeline Company (an affiliate of the Company) accounted for approximately 67 percent, 19 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of MoGas' contracted revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. The loss of all or even a portion of the contracted volumes of these or other customers, as a result of competition, creditworthiness, inability to negotiate extensions or replacements of contracts or\notherwise, could have a material adverse effect on MoGas' business, financial condition and results of operations, unless it is able to contract for comparable volumes from other customers at favorable rates.\nMoGas is exposed to the credit risk of its customers and its credit risk management may not be adequate to protect against such risk.\nMoGas is subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by its customers. MoGas' credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate customer credit risk. If MoGas fails to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers, unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them and inability to re-market the resulting capacity could have a material adverse effect on MoGas' business, financial condition and results of operations. MoGas may not be able to effectively re-market such capacity during and after insolvency proceedings involving a customer.\nMoGas' operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions. If a significant accident or event occurs that results in a business interruption or shutdown for which MoGas is not adequately insured, its operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nMoGas' operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the transmission of natural gas, including:\n\u2022\naging infrastructure, mechanical or other performance problems;\n\u2022\ndamage to pipelines, facilities and related equipment caused by tornadoes, floods, fires and other natural disasters, explosions and acts of terrorism;\n\u2022\ninadvertent damage from third parties, including from construction, farm and utility equipment;\n\u2022\nleaks of natural gas and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities;\n\u2022\noperator error;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, product and waste spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, and unauthorized discharges of products, wastes and other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment, resulting in environmental pollution; and\n\u2022\nexplosions.\nThese risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage and may result in curtailment or suspension of MoGas' related operations or services. A natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which MoGas operates could have a material adverse effect on MoGas' operations and the financial results of its business.\nPipeline safety integrity programs and repairs may impose significant costs and liabilities on MoGas.\nThe Federal Office of Pipeline Safety within the U.S. Department of Transportation requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and to take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in \u201chigh consequence areas\u201d where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm. As an operator, MoGas is required to:\n\u2022\nperform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;\n\u2022\nidentify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area;\n\u2022\nimprove data collection, integration and analysis;\n\u2022\nrepair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and\n\u2022\nimplement preventative and mitigating actions.\nMoGas is required to maintain pipeline integrity testing programs that are intended to assess pipeline integrity. Any repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions could require significant capital and operating expenditures. Should MoGas fail to comply with the Federal Office of Pipeline Safety\u2019s rules and related regulations and orders, it could be subject to significant penalties and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on MoGas' business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of MoGas' services may be subject to fixed-price \u201cnegotiated rate\u201d contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if its cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts.\nUnder FERC policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a \u201cnegotiated rate\u201d which may be above or below the FERC regulated, cost-based recourse rate for that service. These \u201cnegotiated rate\u201d contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs which could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. Any shortfall of revenue as result of these \u201cnegotiated rate\u201d contracts could decrease MoGas' cash flow.\nMoGas competes with other pipelines.\nThe principal elements of competition among pipelines are availability of capacity, rates, terms of service, access to supplies, flexibility and reliability of service. Additionally, FERC\u2019s policies promote competition in natural gas markets by increasing the number of natural gas transmission options available to MoGas' customer base. Any current or future pipeline system or other form of transmission that delivers natural gas into the areas that MoGas serves could offer transmission services that are more desirable to shippers than those MoGas provides because of price, location, facilities or other factors. Increased competition could reduce the volumes of product MoGas transports or, in instances where MoGas does not have long-term contracts with fixed rates, could cause MoGas to decrease the transmission rates it can charge its customers. Competition could intensify the negative impact of factors that adversely affect the demand for MoGas' services, such as adverse economic conditions, weather, higher fuel costs and taxes or other regulatory actions that increase the cost, or limit the use, of products MoGas transports.\nThe expansion of MoGas' existing assets and construction of new assets is subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks, which could adversely affect MoGas' results of operations and financial condition.\nOne of the ways MoGas may grow its business is through the expansion of its existing assets and construction of additional energy infrastructure assets. The construction of additions or modifications to MoGas' existing pipelines, and the construction of other new energy infrastructure assets, involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties beyond MoGas' control and will require the expenditure of significant capital that it would be required to raise. If MoGas undertakes these projects they may not be completed on schedule, at the budgeted cost or at all. Moreover, MoGas' revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if MoGas expands a new pipeline, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and MoGas will not receive any material increases in revenues until the project is completed. Any new pipelines may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve MoGas' expected investment return, which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. The construction of new pipelines may also require MoGas to obtain new rights-of-way, and it may become more expensive for it to obtain these new rights-of-way or to renew existing rights-of-way. If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way increases, MoGas' cash flows could be adversely affected, which also could have a material adverse effect on its results of operation and financial condition.\nThe operation of our energy infrastructure assets, including without limitation those of MoGas , could be adversely affected if third-party pipelines, railroads or other facilities interconnected to our facilities become partially or fully unavailable.\nOur facilities, as well as those of our tenants, connect to other pipelines, railroads or facilities owned by third parties. In particular, MoGas depends upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from its pipelines. For example, its pipelines interconnect, directly or indirectly, with virtually every major interstate pipeline in the eastern portion of the U.S. and a significant number of intrastate pipelines. Because we do not own these third party facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. Accordingly, these pipelines and other facilities may become unavailable, or available only at a reduced capacity. If these pipeline connections were to become unavailable to MoGas for current or future volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage, lack of capacity or any other reason, MoGas' ability to operate efficiently and continue shipping natural gas to end markets could be restricted, thereby reducing its revenues. Likewise, if any of these third-party pipelines or facilities becomes unable to transport any products distributed or transported through our other facilities, such as an interruption in rail or pipeline service to the Portland Terminal Facility, our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected.\nMoGas does not own all of the land on which its pipelines are located, which could disrupt MoGas' operations.\nMoGas does not own all of the land on which its pipelines are located, and MoGas is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use rights required to conduct its operations. MoGas obtains the rights to construct and operate its pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. In certain instances, MoGas' rights-of-way may be subordinate to that of government agencies, which could result in costs or interruptions to MoGas' service. Restrictions on MoGas' ability to use its rights-of-way, through MoGas' inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe lack of availability of natural gas resources may cause customers to seek alternative energy resources, which could materially affect MoGas' revenues, earnings and cash flows.\nMoGas' natural gas business is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas production and reserves. Prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations on the development of natural gas supplies or a shift in supply sources could adversely affect development of additional reserves and production that are accessible by MoGas' facilities. Lack of commercial quantities of natural gas available to these assets could cause customers to seek alternative energy resources, thereby reducing their reliance on MoGas' services, which in turn would materially affect its revenues, earnings and cash flows.\nMoGas is exposed to costs associated with lost and unaccounted for volumes.\nA certain amount of natural gas is naturally lost in connection with its transmission across a pipeline system, and under MoGas' contractual arrangements with its customers, MoGas is entitled to retain a specified volume of natural gas in order to compensate it for such lost and unaccounted for volumes as well as the natural gas used to run MoGas' compressor stations, which we refer to as fuel usage. The level of fuel usage and lost and unaccounted for volumes on MoGas' transmission system may exceed the natural gas volumes retained from its customers as compensation for fuel usage and lost and unaccounted for volumes pursuant to its contractual agreements. The FERC-approved tariffs of MoGas provide for annual filings to adjust the amount of gas retained from customers to eliminate any overages or shortfalls from the prior year. Future exposure to the volatility of natural gas prices as a result of gas imbalances on MoGas' systems could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReductions in demand for natural gas and low market prices of commodities adversely affect MoGas' Pipeline\u2019s operations and cash flows.\nMoGas' regulated business is generally economically stable and not significantly affected in the short term by changing commodity prices. However, its business can be negatively affected in the long term by sustained downturns in the economy or long-term conservation efforts, which could affect long-term demand and market prices for natural gas. These factors are beyond MoGas' control and could impair its ability to meet long-term goals.\nMost of MoGas' revenues are based on regulated tariff rates, which include the recovery of certain fuel costs. However, lower overall economic output would reduce the volume of natural gas transported, resulting in lower earnings and cash flows. Transmission revenues could be affected by long-term economic declines, resulting in the non-renewal of long-term contracts at the time of expiration. Lower demand for natural gas and oil, along with lower prices for natural gas, could result from multiple factors that affect the markets where MoGas operates, including:\n\u2022\nweather conditions, such as abnormally mild winter or summer weather, resulting in lower energy usage for heating or cooling purposes, respectively;\n\u2022\nreduced supply of and demand for energy commodities, including any decrease in the production of natural gas, could negatively affect MoGas' transmission businesses due to lower throughput; and\n\u2022\nreduced capacity and transmission service into, or out of, MoGas' markets.\nOur assets and operations, as well as those of our tenants and other investees and customers, can be affected by extreme weather patterns and other natural phenomena.\nOur assets and operations, as well as those of our tenants and other investees and customers, can be adversely affected by floods, earthquakes, landslides, tornadoes and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme or unseasonable temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with our assets and operations. These events also could result in significant volatility in the supply of energy and power, which might create fluctuations in commodity prices and earnings of companies in the energy infrastructure sector. A significant disruption in our operations or those of our tenants, investees or customers, or a significant liability for which we or any affected tenant or investee is not fully insured, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, extreme weather events could adversely impact the valuation of our energy infrastructure assets.\nWe may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions of real property assets.\nOur ability to identify and complete acquisitions of real property assets on favorable terms and conditions are subject to the following risks:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to acquire a desired asset because of competition from other investors with significant capital, including both publicly traded and non-traded REITs and institutional investment funds;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other investors may significantly increase the purchase price of a desired real property asset or result in less favorable terms;\n\u2022\nwe may not complete the acquisition of a desired real property asset even if we have signed an agreement to acquire such real property asset because such agreements are subject to customary conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to finance acquisitions of real property assets on favorable terms or at all.\nNet leases may not result in fair market lease rates over time.\nWe expect a large portion of our future income to come from net leases. Net leases typically have longer lease terms and, thus, there is an increased risk that if market rental rates increase in future years, the rates under our net leases will be less than fair market rental rates during those years. As a result, our income and distributions could be lower than they would otherwise be if we did not engage in net leases. We generally will seek to include a clause in each lease that provides increases in rent over the term of the lease, but there can be no assurance we will be successful in obtaining such a clause.\nIf a sale-leaseback transaction is re-characterized in a lessee company\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding, our financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe intend to enter into sale-leaseback transactions, whereby we purchase a property and then simultaneously lease the same property back to the seller. In the event of the bankruptcy of a lessee company, a transaction structured as a sale-leaseback may be re-characterized as either a financing or a joint venture, either of which outcomes could adversely affect our business.\nIf the sale-leaseback were re-characterized as a financing, we might not be considered the owner of the property, and as a result would have the status of a creditor in relation to the lessee company. In that event, we would no longer have the right to sell or encumber our ownership interest in the property. Instead, we would have a claim against the lessee company for the amounts owed under the lease, with the claim arguably secured by the property. The lessee company/debtor might have the ability to restructure the terms, interest rate and amortization schedule of its outstanding balance. If confirmed by the bankruptcy court, we could be bound by the new terms, and prevented from foreclosing our lien on the property. If the sale-leaseback were re-characterized as a joint venture, we and the lessee company could be treated as co-venturers with regard to the property. As a result, we could be held liable, under some circumstances, for debts incurred by the lessee company relating to the property. Either of these outcomes could adversely affect our cash flow and the amount available for distribution.\nIf we have to replace the tenant under any of our leases of energy infrastructure assets, we may have trouble identifying a new tenant that will agree to acceptable lease terms.\nIf we determine that a renewal of a lease with any present or future tenant of any of our energy infrastructure assets is not in the best interests of our stockholders, if a tenant determines it no longer wishes to be the tenant under a lease upon its expiration, if we desire to terminate a lease as a result of a breach of that lease by the tenant or if we lose any tenant as a result of such tenant\u2019s bankruptcy, then in each circumstance we would need to identify a new tenant for the lease. Any new tenant would need to be a qualified and reputable operator of such energy infrastructure assets with the wherewithal and capability of acting as our tenant. Furthermore, in many such circumstances any new tenant of a significant portion of our assets would need to be willing and able to make their financial statements public and agree to timely provide us with those financial statements in order for us comply with our obligation to include our tenant\u2019s financial statements in the periodic reports we file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). There is no assurance that we would be able to identify a tenant that meets these criteria, or that if we are able to identify any such tenant, we would receive lease terms from a new tenant that are as favorable as the lease terms that were in place with the prior tenant.\nThe relative illiquidity of our real property and energy infrastructure asset investments may interfere with our ability to sell our assets when we desire and may discourage third parties form seeking to acquire control of the Company or our business.\nInvestments in real property and energy infrastructure assets are relatively illiquid compared to other investments. Accordingly, we may not be able to sell such assets when we desire or at prices acceptable to us in response to changes in economic or other conditions. This could substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders. Further, the relative illiquidity of our assets may make us less desirable to third parties seeking to acquire our business, which may prevent a change in control of the Company that would be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nOur focus on the energy infrastructure sector will subject us to more risks than if we were broadly diversified.\nBecause we specifically focus on the energy infrastructure sector, investments in our common stock may present more risks than if we were broadly diversified over numerous sectors of the economy. Therefore, a downturn in the U.S. energy infrastructure\nsector would have a larger impact on us than on a company that does not concentrate in one sector of the economy. The energy infrastructure sector can be significantly affected by the supply of and demand for specific products and services; the supply and demand for crude oil, natural gas, and other energy commodities; the price of crude oil, natural gas, and other energy commodities; exploration, production and other capital expenditures; government regulation; world and regional events and economic conditions.\nEnergy infrastructure companies are subject to variations in the supply and demand of various energy commodities.\nA decrease in the production of natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil, coal, refined petroleum products or other such commodities, or a decrease in the volume of such commodities available for transportation, mining, processing, storage or distribution, may adversely impact the financial performance of companies in the energy infrastructure sector. Production declines and volume decreases could be caused by various factors, including catastrophic events affecting production, depletion of resources, labor difficulties, political events, OPEC actions, environmental proceedings, increased regulations, equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems, failure to obtain necessary permits, unscheduled outages, unanticipated expenses, inability to successfully carry out new construction or acquisitions, import supply disruption, or increased competition from alternative energy sources. Alternatively, a sustained decline in demand for such commodities could also adversely affect the financial performance of companies in the energy infrastructure sector. Factors that could lead to a decline in demand include economic recession or other adverse economic conditions, higher fuel taxes or governmental regulations, increases in fuel economy, consumer shifts to the use of alternative fuel sources, changes in commodity prices or weather. Factors that could lead to a decrease in market demand include a recession or other adverse economic conditions, an increase in the market price of the underlying commodity, higher taxes or other regulatory actions that increase costs, or a shift in consumer demand for such products. Demand may also be adversely impacted by consumer sentiment with respect to global warming or by any state or federal legislation intended to promote the use of alternative energy sources such as bio-fuels, solar and wind. Should energy infrastructure companies experience variations in supply and demand as described above, the resulting decline in operating or financial performance could impact the value or quality of our assets.\nEnergy infrastructure companies are and will be subject to the risk of fluctuations in commodity prices.\nIn addition to fluctuations in supply and demand as discussed above, the operations and financial performance of companies in the energy infrastructure sector may be directly affected by energy commodity prices, especially those companies in the energy infrastructure sector owning the underlying energy commodity. Commodity prices fluctuate for several reasons, including changes in market and economic conditions, the impact of weather on demand or supply, levels of domestic production and imported commodities, energy conservation, domestic and foreign governmental regulation and taxation and the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems. Volatility of commodity prices also make it more difficult for companies in the energy infrastructure sector to raise capital to the extent the market perceives that their performance may be tied directly or indirectly to commodity prices. Historically, energy commodity prices have been cyclical and exhibited significant volatility. Should energy infrastructure companies experience variations in supply and demand as described above, the resulting decline in operating or financial performance could impact the value or quality of our assets.\nMany companies in the energy infrastructure sector are subject to the risk that they, or their customers, will be unable to replace depleted reserves of energy commodities.\nMany companies in the energy infrastructure sector are either (i) engaged in the production of natural gas liquids, refined petroleum products, or aggregates such as crushed stone, sand and gravel, or (ii) are engaged in transporting, storing, distributing and processing these items on behalf of producers. To maintain or grow their revenues, many customers of these companies need to maintain or expand their reserves through exploration of new sources of supply, through the development of existing sources, through acquisitions, or through long-term contracts to acquire reserves. The financial performance of companies in the energy infrastructure sector, which we expect to comprise all of the tenants for the properties in which we plan to invest, may be adversely affected if the companies to which they provide service are unable to cost-effectively acquire additional reserves sufficient to replace the natural decline. These adverse impacts on our tenants also could adversely impact the value or quality of our assets.\nEnergy infrastructure companies are and will be subject to extensive regulation because of their participation in the energy infrastructure sector, which could adversely impact the business and financial performance of our tenants and the value of our assets.\nCompanies in the energy infrastructure sector are subject to significant federal, state and local government regulation in virtually every aspect of their operations, including how facilities are constructed, maintained and operated, environmental and safety controls, and the prices they may charge for the products and services they provide. Various governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with these regulations and the permits issued under them, and violators are subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including civil fines, injunctions or both. Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted in the future that likely would increase compliance costs, which could adversely affect the business and financial performance of our tenants in the energy infrastructure sector and the value or quality of our assets.\nRisks Related to Our Financing Arrangements\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences, including impairing our ability to obtain additional financing or pay future distributions, as well as subjecting us to the risk of foreclosure on any mortgaged properties in the event of non-payment of the related debt.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding consolidated indebtedness of approximately $99 million. Our leverage could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nresult in the acceleration of a significant amount of debt for non-compliance with the terms of such debt or, if such debt contains cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, other debt;\n\u2022\nmaterially impair our ability to borrow undrawn amounts under existing financing arrangements or to obtain additional financing or refinancing on favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to paying principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the cash flow available to fund our business, to pay distributions, including those necessary to maintain REIT qualification, or to use for other purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to economic downturns;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to withstand competitive pressures; or\n\u2022\nreduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions.\nFurther, we expect to mortgage many of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness. If we are unable to meet mortgage payments, such failure could result in the loss of assets due to foreclosure and transfer to the mortgagee or sale on unfavorable terms with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure of one or more of our properties could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to service debt and make distributions and the market price of our stock.\nWe may not be able to refinance the indebtedness that we incurred to fund the acquisition of the Pinedale LGS.\nPinedale LP borrowed $70 million under its credit facility to finance the acquisition of the Pinedale LGS and such indebtedness will mature in 2015 or 2016, if the option to extend the date of maturity is exercised. The outstanding balance on this indebtedness was $67.1 million at December 31, 2014. Pinedale LP may not be able to refinance that indebtedness on its existing terms or at all. If funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may not be able to meet our obligations as they come due. Moreover, without adequate funding, we may be unable to execute our growth strategies, complete future acquisitions, take advantage of other business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nWe face risks associated with our dependence on external sources of capital.\nIn order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 percent of our REIT taxable income, and we will be subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed. Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations. As a result, to fund capital needs, we must rely on third-party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms, if at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including (i) general market conditions; (ii) the market\u2019s perception of our growth potential; (iii) our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and (iv) the market price of our capital stock. Additional debt financing may substantially increase our debt-to-total capitalization ratio. Additional equity issuances may dilute the holdings of our current stockholders.\nCovenants in our loan documents could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we had satisfied our payment obligations. If we were to default under credit agreements or other debt instruments, our financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe face risks related to \u201cballoon payments\u201d and refinancings.\nCertain of our mortgages will have significant outstanding principal balances on their maturity dates, commonly known as \u201cballoon payments.\u201d There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance the debt on favorable terms or at all. To the extent we\ncannot refinance this debt on favorable terms or at all, we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms or pay higher interest rates, either of which would have an adverse impact on our financial performance and ability to service debt and make distributions.\nRisks Related to REIT Qualification and Federal Income Tax Laws\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT for fiscal 2013 and subsequent years, but the IRS may challenge our qualification as a REIT.\nWe have elected to be a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In order to qualify as a REIT, a substantial percentage of our income must be derived from, and our assets consist of, real estate assets, and, in certain cases, other investment property. We have acquired and managed investments which satisfy the REIT tests. Whether a particular investment is considered a real estate asset for such purposes depends upon the facts and circumstances of the investment. Due to the factual nature of the determination, the IRS may challenge whether any particular investment will qualify as a real estate asset or realize income which satisfies the REIT income tests. In determining whether an investment is a real property asset, we will look at the Code and the IRS\u2019s interpretation of the Code in regulations, published rulings, private letter rulings and other guidance. In the case of a private letter ruling issued to another taxpayer, we would not be able to bind the IRS to the holding of such ruling. If the IRS successfully challenges our qualification as a REIT we may not be able to achieve our objectives and the value of our stock may decline. As a REIT, our distributions from earnings and profits will be treated as ordinary income and a return of capital, and generally will not qualify as qualified dividend income (\u201cQDI\u201d). To the extent that the REIT had accumulated C corporation earnings and profits from the periods prior to 2013, we have distributed such earnings and profits in 2013, which have been treated as QDI.\nFluctuations in the fair market value of the assets that we own and that are owned by our TRS may adversely affect our continued qualification as a REIT.\nWe have to satisfy the asset tests at the end of each quarter. Although fluctuations in the fair market value of our assets should not adversely affect our qualification as a REIT, we must satisfy the asset test immediately after effecting the REIT acquisition of any asset. Thus, we may be limited in our ability to purchase certain assets depending upon the potential fluctuations in the fair market value of our direct and indirect assets. As fair market value determinations are inherently factual, risks exist as to the fair market determination.\nAlthough we believe that the Pinedale LGS and the Portland Terminal Facility constitute real estate assets for tax purposes, that belief is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or any court and does not guarantee our qualification as a REIT.\nIn 2007, 2009 and 2010, the IRS issued three separate private letter rulings that confirmed certain energy infrastructure assets as real estate assets for tax purposes. The potential qualifying real estate assets in the energy infrastructure sector include electric transmission and distribution systems, pipeline systems, and storage and terminaling systems. Further, the IRS proposed regulations in 2014 clarifying that certain infrastructure assets constitute real estate assets for REIT purposes. We believe that substantially all of the Pinedale LGS and Portland Terminal Facility constitute real estate assets for tax purposes consistent with these private letter rulings and the proposed regulations. Although both private letter rulings and the proposed regulations provide insight into the current thinking of the IRS on tax issues, the private letter rulings may only be relied upon by the taxpayer to whom they were issued and are not binding on the IRS with respect to us, the Pinedale LGS or the Portland Terminal Facility, and the proposed regulations have not been finalized. We have not obtained any private letter rulings with respect to the Pinedale LGS or the Portland Terminal Facility. If the Pinedale LGS does not constitute a real estate asset for federal income tax purposes, we would likely fail to qualify as a REIT, would not achieve our objectives and the value of our stock could decline.\nWe are subject to a corporate level tax on certain built in gains if certain assets are sold during the 10 year period following our initial election to be taxed as a REIT.\nGenerally, a REIT is treated as a flow-through entity for federal income tax purposes, as a REIT\u2019s income is generally subject to a single level of federal taxation, which is accomplished by the REIT annually distributing at least ninety percent of its REIT taxable income.\nHowever, through 2022, we will be subject to a REIT level federal income tax on any built-in gain recognized during such period. We do not anticipate incurring any significant built-in gain tax. If a REIT satisfies the minimum distribution requirement, it generally is entitled to a deduction for dividends paid. The REIT stockholders are then required to report the REIT dividend as ordinary income. A REIT stockholder\u2019s receipt of dividends generally will not qualify as qualified dividend income or for the dividends received deduction discussed above. Thus, as a REIT, we are more favorably treated for federal income tax purposes than under our prior taxation as a C corporation.\nIn order to remain qualified as a REIT, we are required to satisfy gross income and asset tests. Generally, such tests require that a substantial percentage of the REIT\u2019s income be derived from, and assets consist of, real estate assets, and, in certain cases, other\ninvestment property. This is a factual determination that we generally will have to make annually with respect to the income tests and quarterly with respect to the asset tests.\nThere are uncertainties relating to the estimate of our special distribution.\nTo qualify for taxation as a REIT, we were required to distribute to our stockholders all of our pre-REIT accumulated earnings and profits, if any, as measured for federal income tax purposes, prior to the end of 2013. Any determination that we failed to appropriately make the special distribution could result in our disqualification for taxation as a REIT. The determination of the timing and amount to be distributed in the special distribution involved a complex factual and legal determination. It is possible that the IRS could interpret the applicable law differently than we did in making such determination. We believe that our distributions did satisfy the requirements relating to the distribution of our pre-REIT accumulated earnings and profits. There are, however, substantial uncertainties relating to the computation of our distribution, including the possibility that the IRS could, in auditing tax years prior to our REIT election, successfully assert that our taxable income should be increased, which could increase our pre-REIT accumulated earnings and profits. Thus, we may have failed to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our pre-REIT accumulated earnings and profits by the close of 2013. Moreover, although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our pre-REIT accumulated earnings and profits, we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of them or the economic impact to us of doing so.\nFailure to qualify as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our common stock.\nBeginning with our fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, we believe our income and investments have allowed us to meet the income and asset tests necessary for us to qualify for and we have elected to be taxed as a REIT for fiscal 2013 and 2014. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code as to which there may only be limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of facts and circumstances not entirely within our control. Future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be organized or will operate to qualify as a REIT for future fiscal years. If, with respect to any taxable year, we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not be allowed to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income. After our initial election and qualification as a REIT, if we later failed to so qualify and we were not entitled to relief under the relevant statutory provisions, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, corporate-level income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, would apply to our taxable income at regular corporate rates. As a result, the amount available for distribution to holders of equity securities would be reduced for the year or years involved, and we would no longer be required to make distributions. In addition, our failure to qualify as a REIT could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and it could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nThe ability of stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company will be limited by certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by Maryland law.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to amend our charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of stock, to authorize us to issue additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock and to classify or reclassify unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and thereafter to authorize us to issue such classified or reclassified shares of stock. We believe that these provisions in our articles of incorporation will provide us with increased flexibility in structuring possible future financings and acquisitions and in meeting other needs that might arise. The additional classes or series, as well as the additional authorized shares of common stock, will be available for issuance without further action by our stockholders, unless such action is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which our securities may be listed or traded. Although our board of directors does not currently intend to do so, it could authorize us to issue a class or series of stock that could, depending upon the terms of the particular class or series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of our company that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or that our common stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interests.\nTo maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our articles of incorporation include provisions designed to ensure that not more than 50 percent in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by or for five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities such as private foundations) at any time during the last half of any taxable year. Our articles generally prohibit any individual (as defined under the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) from actually owning or being deemed to own by virtue of the applicable constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, (i) more than 9.8 percent (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock or (ii) more than 9.8 percent in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our stock, in each case, excluding any shares of our stock not treated as outstanding for federal income tax purposes. Subject to the exceptions described below, our articles of incorporation further prohibit any person or entity from actually or constructively owning shares in excess of these limits. We refer to these restrictions as the \u201cownership limitation\nprovisions.\u201d Our articles of incorporation also provide that any transfer of shares of our capital stock which would, if effective, result in our capital stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons (as determined pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code) shall be void ab initio and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in such shares. These ownership limitation provisions may prevent or delay a change in control and, as a result, could adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock. However, upon request, our board of directors may waive the ownership limitation provisions with respect to a particular stockholder and establish different ownership limitation provisions for such stockholder. In granting such waiver, our board of directors may also require the stockholder receiving such waiver to make certain representations, warranties and covenants related to our ability to qualify as a REIT.\nComplying with the REIT requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or liquidate certain of our investments.\nTo remain a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. We may be required to make distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to make certain otherwise attractive investments or undertake other activities that might otherwise be beneficial to our company and our stockholders, or may require us to borrow or liquidate investments in unfavorable market conditions. In addition, Corridor may be unable to find investments that comply with REIT requirements, thereby limiting our ability to grow or even maintain our asset base.\nIn connection with such REIT requirements, we must ensure that, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75 percent of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified real property assets. The remainder of our investments in securities (other than cash, cash items, government securities, securities issued by a REIT taxable subsidiary or certain other qualified assets) generally cannot include more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 percent of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5 percent of the value of our total assets (other than cash, cash items, government securities, certain other securities and qualified real property assets) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 25 percent of the value of our total securities can be represented by securities of one or more of a certain class of issuers. After meeting these requirements at the close of a calendar quarter, if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any subsequent calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification. As a result, we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio otherwise attractive investments. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.\nAs a REIT, re-characterization of sale-leaseback transactions may cause us to lose our REIT status.\nWe intend to purchase certain properties and simultaneously lease the same property back to the seller of such properties. While we will use our best efforts to structure any such sale-leaseback transaction so that the lease will be characterized as a \u201ctrue lease,\u201d thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the IRS could challenge such characterization. In the event that any sale-leaseback transaction is recharacterized as a financing transaction or loan for U.S. federal income tax purposes, deductions for depreciation and cost recovery relating to such property would be disallowed. If a sale-leaseback transaction were so recharacterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT qualification \u201casset tests\u201d or the \u201cincome tests\u201d and, consequently, lose our REIT status effective with the year of re-characterization. Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated which might also cause us to fail to meet the distribution requirement for a taxable year.\nAs a REIT, we are required to make distributions, other than capital gain distributions, to our stockholders each year in the amount of at least 90 percent of our REIT taxable income in order to deduct distributions to our stockholders. As a result, we will continue to need additional capital to make new investments. If additional funds are unavailable or not available on favorable terms, our ability to make new investments will be impaired.\nAs a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90 percent of our REIT taxable income in order to deduct distributions to our stockholders, and as such we may require additional capital to make new investments or carry existing investments. We may acquire additional capital from the issuance of securities senior to our common stock, including additional borrowings or other indebtedness or the issuance of additional securities. We may also acquire additional capital through the issuance of additional equity. However, we may not be able to raise additional capital in the future on favorable terms or at all. Unfavorable economic conditions could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. We may issue debt securities, other instruments of indebtedness or preferred stock, and we borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, which we refer to collectively as \u201csenior securities.\u201d As a result of issuing senior securities, we will also be exposed to typical risks associated with leverage, including increased risk of loss. If we issue preferred securities which will rank \u201csenior\u201d to our common stock in our capital structure, the holders of such preferred securities may have separate voting rights and other rights, preferences or privileges more favorable than those of our common stock, and the issuance of such preferred\nsecurities could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for security holders or otherwise be in our best interest.\nTo the extent our ability to issue debt or other senior securities is constrained, we will depend on issuances of additional common stock to finance new investments. If we raise additional funds by issuing more of our common stock or senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, the percentage ownership of our stockholders at that time would decrease, and you may experience dilution.\nIf we acquire C corporations in the future, we may inherit material tax liabilities and other tax attributes from such acquired corporations, and we may be required to distribute earnings and profits.\nFrom time to time we may acquire C corporations or assets of C corporations in transactions in which the basis of the corporations\u2019 assets in our hands is determined by reference to the basis of the assets in the hands of the acquired corporations, or carry-over basis transactions.\nIn the case of assets we acquire from a C corporation in a carry-over basis transaction, if we dispose of any such asset in a taxable transaction (including by deed in lieu of foreclosure) during the ten-year period beginning on the date of the carry-over basis transaction, then we will be required to pay tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate on the gain recognized to the extent of the excess of (1) the fair market value of the asset over (2) our adjusted tax basis in the asset, in each case determined as of the date of the carry-over basis transaction. Any taxes we pay as a result of such gain would reduce the amount available for distribution to our stockholders. The imposition of such tax may require us to forgo an otherwise attractive disposition of any assets we acquire from a C corporation in a carry-over basis transaction, and as a result may reduce the liquidity of our portfolio of investments. In addition, in such a carry-over basis transaction, we will succeed to any tax liabilities and earnings and profits of the acquired C corporation. To qualify as a REIT, we must distribute any non-REIT earnings and profits by the close of the taxable year in which such transaction occurs. If the IRS were to determine that we acquired non-REIT earnings and profits from a corporation that we failed to distribute prior to the end of the taxable year in which the carry-over basis transaction occurred, we could avoid disqualification as a REIT by paying a \u201cdeficiency dividend.\u201d Under these procedures, we generally would be required to distribute any such non-REIT earnings and profits to our stockholders within 90 days of the determination and pay a statutory interest charge at a specified rate to the IRS. Such a distribution would be in addition to the distribution of REIT taxable income necessary to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement and may require that we borrow funds to make the distribution even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for borrowings. In addition, payment of the statutory interest charge could materially and adversely affect us.\nLegislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us.\nThe rules dealing with federal, state and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could materially and adversely affect our investors or us. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us. New legislation, Treasury Regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or the income tax consequences of such qualification.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure and Governance\nThe ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT qualification or alter our business policies without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders.\nOur Board of Directors determines our growth, investment, financing, capitalization, borrowing, REIT status, operations and distributions policies. Although our Board of Directors has no present intention to amend or reverse any of these policies, they may be amended or revised without notice to stockholders. We cannot assure you that any changes in our policies will serve fully the interests of all stockholders. In particular, our articles of incorporation provide that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to be a REIT, we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and state and local taxes, which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our stockholders.\nCorridor may serve as a manager to other entities, which may create conflicts of interest not in the best interest of us or our stockholders.\nCorridor\u2019s services under the Management Agreement are not exclusive, and, while it currently does not have any contractual arrangement to do so, it is free to furnish the same or similar services to other entities, including businesses that may directly or indirectly compete with us so long as its services to us are not impaired by the provision of such services to others. Corridor and its members may have obligations to other entities, the fulfillment of which might not be in the best interests of us or our stockholders.\nWe will be dependent upon key personnel of Corridor for our future success.\nWe have entered into a management agreement with Corridor to provide full management services to us for real property asset investments. We will be dependent on the diligence, expertise and business relationships of the management of Corridor to implement our strategy of acquiring real property assets. The departure of one or more investment professionals of Corridor could have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement this strategy and on the value of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our strategy.\nProvisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law and our charter and bylaws could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nThe following considerations related to provisions of Maryland General Corporation Law, and of our charter and bylaws, may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or making difficult a change in control of our Company or the removal of our incumbent directors:\n\u2022\nWe are subject to the Business Combination Act of the Maryland General Corporation Law (MGCL). However, pursuant to the statute, our Board of Directors has adopted a resolution exempting us from the Maryland Business Combination Act for any business combination between us and any person to the extent that such business combination receives the prior approval of our board.\n\u2022\nOur bylaws exempt from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act acquisitions of stock by any person. If we amend our bylaws to repeal the exemption from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act, the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act also may make it more difficult to obtain control of our Company.\n\u2022\nAs described above, our charter includes a share ownership limit designed to preserve our status as a REIT, which may have the effect of precluding an acquisition of control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors.\n\u2022\nUnder our charter, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes serving staggered terms, which will make it more difficult for a hostile bidder to acquire control of us.\n\u2022\nOur charter also contains a provision whereby we have elected to be subject to the provisions of Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL relating to the filling of vacancies on our board of directors. Further, through provisions in our charter and bylaws unrelated to Subtitle 8, we (1) require a two-thirds vote for the removal of any director from the board, which removal must be for cause, (2) vest in the board the exclusive power to fix the number of directors, subject to limitations set forth in our charter and bylaws, and (3) require, unless called by the chairman of our Board of Directors, our chief executive officer, our president or our Board of Directors, the request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on a matter at such meeting to call a special meeting to consider and vote on any matter that may properly be considered at a meeting of stockholders.\n\u2022\nIn addition, our Board of Directors may, without stockholder action, authorize the issuance of shares of stock in one or more classes or series, including preferred stock. Our Board of Directors also may, without stockholder action, amend our charter to increase the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue.\nThe existence of these provisions, among others, may have a negative impact on the price of our common stock and may discourage third party bids for ownership of our Company. These provisions may prevent any premiums being offered to you for our common stock.\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited by the requirements of Maryland law.\nOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock and Series A Preferred Stock is limited by the laws of Maryland. Under Maryland General Corporation Law, a Maryland corporation may not make a distribution if, after giving effect to the distribution, the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as the debts become due in the usual course of business, or the corporation\u2019s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus, unless the corporation\u2019s charter provides otherwise, the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of stockholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. Accordingly, we may not make a distribution on our common stock and the Series A Preferred Stock if, after giving effect to the distribution, we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus, unless the terms of such class or series provide otherwise, the amount that would be needed to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of the holders of any shares of any class or series of preferred stock then outstanding, if any, with preferences senior to those of our common stock and the Series A Preferred Stock.\nRisks Related to Our Non-Real Estate Investments\nOur securities investments in privately-held companies present certain challenges, including availability of information about these companies and illiquidity that may impact our ability to liquidate these investments in a timely and/or advantageous manner.\nWe currently have securities investments in privately-held companies. Generally, little public information exists about these companies. If we are unable to obtain all material information about these companies, including with respect to operational, regulatory, environmental, litigation and managerial risks, we may not make a fully-informed investment decision, and we may lose some or all of the money invested in these companies. Substantially all of these securities are subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or are otherwise less liquid than publicly traded securities. The illiquidity of these investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments at advantageous times and prices or in a timely manner. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our private securities investments quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we previously have recorded our investments. We also may face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in the securities of a portfolio company to the extent that we or one of our affiliates have material non-public information regarding such portfolio company.\nAll of our securities investments are, and will continue to be, recorded at fair value. Because such valuations are inherently uncertain, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed.\nWe continue to hold investments that are in the form of securities or loans that are not publicly traded. The fair value of these investments may not be readily determinable. For securities investments that are reported at fair value, we will value these investments quarterly at fair value. We have retained independent valuation firms to provide third-party valuation consulting services. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors reviews the independent valuation firms\u2019 supporting analyses and accepts the valuations. The types of factors that may be considered in fair value pricing of an investment include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the issuing company\u2019s earnings and ability to make payments, the markets in which the issuing company does business, comparison to publicly traded companies, discounted cash flow and other relevant factors. Because such valuations are inherently uncertain, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. As a result, we may not be able to dispose of our holdings at a price equal to or greater than the determined fair value, which could have a negative impact on our net equity and earnings.\nThe lack of liquidity in our private securities investments may make it difficult to liquidate these securities at favorable prices, and as a result, we may suffer losses.\nWe have historically invested in the equity of companies whose securities are not publicly traded, and whose securities may be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise be less liquid than publicly-traded securities. As of December 31, 2014, all of our securities investments were invested in illiquid securities. The illiquidity of these investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired. In addition, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded these investments when we liquidate any of these securities. The illiquidity of these securities investments may make it difficult for us to dispose of them at favorable prices, and, as a result, we may suffer losses.\nIf our acquisitions do not meet our performance expectations, you may not receive distributions.\nWe intend to make distributions on a quarterly basis to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. Also, restrictions and provisions in any credit facilities we enter into or debt securities we issue may limit our ability to make distributions. We cannot assure you that you will receive distributions at a particular level or at all.\nIf we were deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business and the price of our securities.\nWe do not believe that we are an investment company under the 1940 Act. If during the period in which we are liquidating our securities investments in privately-held companies we make an investment in securities, or one of our infrastructure real property asset acquisitions were characterized as an investment in securities, we could be deemed an investment company for purposes of the 1940 Act. If we were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and would have a material adverse effect on our operations and the price of our common stock.\nChanges in laws or regulations or in the interpretations of laws or regulations could significantly affect our operations and cost of doing business.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations and are subject to judicial and administrative decisions that affect our operations, including loan originations, maximum interest rates, fees and other charges, disclosures to equity investees the terms of secured transactions, collection and foreclosure procedures and other trade practices. If these laws, regulations or decisions change, we may have to incur significant expenses in order to comply, or we may have to restrict our operations. In addition, if we do not comply with applicable laws, regulations and decisions, or fail to obtain licenses that may become necessary for the conduct of our business, we may be subject to civil fines and criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAdditional Risks to Our Stockholders\nOur use of leverage increases the risk of investing in our securities and will increase the costs borne by common stockholders.\nOur use of leverage through the issuance of any preferred stock or debt securities, and any additional borrowings or other transactions involving indebtedness (other than for temporary or emergency purposes) are or would be considered \u201csenior securities\u201d and create risks. Leverage may adversely affect common stockholders. If the return on securities acquired with borrowed funds or other leverage proceeds does not exceed the cost of the leverage, the use of leverage could cause us to lose money.\nOur issuance of senior securities involves offering expenses and other costs, including interest payments, which are borne indirectly by our common stockholders. Fluctuations in interest rates could increase interest or dividend payments on our senior securities, and could reduce cash available for distribution on common stock. Increased operating costs, including the financing cost associated with any leverage, may reduce our total return to common stockholders.\nRating agency guidelines applicable to any senior securities may impose asset coverage requirements, dividend limitations, voting right requirements (in the case of the senior equity securities), and restrictions on our portfolio composition and our use of certain investment techniques and strategies. The terms of any senior securities or other borrowings may impose additional requirements, restrictions and limitations that are more stringent than those required by a rating agency that rates outstanding senior securities. These requirements may have an adverse effect on us and may affect our ability to pay distributions on common stock and preferred stock. To the extent necessary, we may redeem our senior securities to maintain the required asset coverage. Doing so may require that we liquidate investments at a time when it would not otherwise be desirable to do so.\nIn addition, lenders from whom we may borrow money or holders of our debt securities may have fixed dollar claims on our assets that are superior to the claims of our stockholders, and we have granted, and may in the future grant, a security interest in our assets in connection with our debt. In the case of a liquidation event, those lenders or note holders would receive proceeds before our stockholders. If the value of our assets increases, then leveraging would cause the book value of our common stock to increase more than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged. Conversely, if the value of our assets decreases, leveraging would cause the book value of our common stock to decline more than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged. Similarly, any increase in our revenue in excess of interest expense on our borrowed funds would cause our net income to increase more than it would without the leverage. Any decrease in our revenue would cause our net income to decline more than it would have had we not borrowed funds and could negatively affect our ability to make distributions on our common stock. Our ability to service any debt that we incur will depend largely on our financial performance and the performance of our investments and will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures.\nSales of our common stock may put pressure on our stock price.\nThe sale of our common stock (or the perception that such sales may occur) may have an adverse effect on prices in the secondary market for our common stock. An increase in the number of shares of common stock available may put downward pressure on the market price for our common stock and make it more difficult for stockholders to sell their shares. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell additional equity securities in the future at a time and price we deem appropriate.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to pay dividends regularly.\nOur ability to pay dividends in the future is dependent on our ability to operate profitably and to generate cash from our operations and the operations of our subsidiaries. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pay dividends on a regular quarterly basis in the future. Furthermore, any new shares of common stock issued will substantially increase the cash required to continue to pay cash dividends at current levels. Any common stock or preferred stock that may in the future be issued to finance acquisitions, upon exercise of stock options or otherwise, would have a similar effect.\nAdditional Risks Related to Our Preferred Stock\nThe depositary shares are a new issue of securities and do not have an established trading market, which may negatively affect their market value and your ability to transfer or sell your depositary shares.\nThe depositary shares, each of which represents 1/100th of a share of our Series A Preferred Stock, are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. The depositary shares are listed on the NYSE; however, an active trading market on the NYSE for the depositary shares may not develop or, if one develops, it may not be maintained. As a result, the ability to transfer or sell the depositary shares and any trading price of the depositary shares could be adversely affected.\nThe market price of the depositary shares representing interests in our Series A Preferred Stock may be adversely affected by the future incurrence of debt or issuance of preferred stock by the Company.\nIn the future, we may increase our capital resources by making offerings of debt securities and preferred stock of the Company and other borrowings by the Company. The debt securities, preferred stock (if senior to our Series A Preferred Stock) and borrowings of the Company are senior in right of payment to our Series A Preferred Stock, and all payments (including dividends, principal and interest) and liquidating distributions on such securities and borrowings could limit our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to the holders of depositary shares representing interests in our Series A Preferred Stock.\nBecause our decision to issue securities and make borrowings in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors, some of which may be beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings or borrowings. Thus, holders of the depositary shares representing interests in Series A Preferred Stock bear the risk of our future offerings or borrowings reducing the market price of the depositary shares representing interests in our Series A Preferred Stock.\nA holder of depositary shares representing interests in the Series A Preferred Stock has extremely limited voting rights.\nThe voting rights of a holder of depositary shares are limited. Our common stock is the only class of our securities that carries full voting rights. Voting rights for holders of depositary shares exist primarily with respect to the ability to elect (together with the holders of other series of preferred stock on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, if any) two additional directors to our board of directors in the event that six quarterly dividends (whether or not declared or consecutive) payable on the Series A Preferred Stock are in arrears, and with respect to voting on amendments to our Charter, including the articles supplementary creating our Series A Preferred Stock (in some cases voting together with the holders of Parity Preferred Stock as a single class) that materially and adversely affect the rights of the holders of depositary shares representing interests in the Series A Preferred Stock or create additional classes or series of our stock that are senior to the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that in any event adequate provision for redemption has not been made. Other than certain limited circumstances, holders of depositary shares do not have any voting rights.\nThe Change of Control conversion feature of Series A Preferred Stock may not adequately compensate the holders, and the Change of Control conversion and redemption features of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock underlying the depositary shares may make it more difficult for a party to take over the Company or discourage a party from taking over the Company.\nUpon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Articles Supplementary for Series A Preferred Stock), holders of the depositary shares representing interests in our Series A Preferred Stock will have the right (unless, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date (as defined in the Articles Supplementary for Series A Preferred Stock), we have provided notice of our election to redeem the depositary shares either pursuant to our optional redemption right or our special optional redemption right) to convert some or all of their depositary shares into shares of our common stock (or equivalent value of Alternative Conversion Consideration). Upon such a conversion, the maximum number of shares of common stock that holders of depositary shares will receive for each depositary share converted will be limited to the Share Cap. If the Common Stock Price is less than $3.25 (which is 50 percent of the per share closing sale price of our common stock on January 21, 2015), subject to adjustment, the holders will receive a maximum of 7.6923 shares of our common stock per depositary share, which may result in a holder receiving value that is less than the liquidation preference of the depositary shares. In addition, there is an aggregate cap of 17,307,675 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Change of Control conversion right. These features of the Series A Preferred Stock may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for the Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a Change of Control of the Company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock and Series A Preferred Stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-current market price or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests.\nThe market price of the depositary shares could be substantially affected by various factors.\nThe market price of the depositary shares will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time, including:\n\u2022\nPrevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market price of the depositary shares representing interests in our Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u2022\nThe market for similar securities issued by other REITs;\n\u2022\nGeneral economic and financial market conditions;\n\u2022\nThe financial condition, performance and prospects of us, our tenants and our competitors;\n\u2022\nAny rating assigned by a rating agency to the depositary shares;\n\u2022\nChanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us, our competitors or our industry; and\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results and those of our competitors.\nIn addition, over the last several years, prices of equity securities in the U.S. trading markets have been experiencing extreme price fluctuations. As a result of these and other factors, investors who purchase the depositary shares in this offering may experience a decrease, which could be substantial and rapid, in the market price of the depositary shares, including decreases unrelated to our financial condition, performance or prospects. Likewise, in the event that the depositary shares become convertible and are converted into shares of our common stock, holders of our common stock issued upon such conversion may experience a similar decrease, which also could be substantial and rapid, in the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 91801, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "CORR"}
