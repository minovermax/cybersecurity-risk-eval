{"cik": "1481792", "company": "Quad/Graphics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to Quad\u2019s securities. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Quad\u2019s Business, Operations and Industry\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and supply chain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in national, state and local government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, border closings, restrictions on public gatherings, quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus, shelter-in-place restrictions, and limitations or shutdowns of business operations. These measures have impacted and may further impact the Company\u2019s workforce and operations, the operations of its clients, and those of its suppliers. Quad has significant operations in the United States and printing operations or investments in printing operations in England, France, Germany, Poland, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Brazil and India, and each of these countries has been affected by the pandemic and taken measures to try to contain it, resulting in disruptions at some of the Company\u2019s printing facilities and support operations. There is still uncertainty regarding the full impact and duration of such measures and potential future measures, and restrictions on the Company\u2019s access to its facilities or on its support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for Quad\u2019s suppliers.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and has caused an economic slowdown that may continue. The pandemic has also weakened demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, which has resulted in a decline in sales, and it remains uncertain what impact this weakened demand will have on future sales once conditions further improve. The pandemic could also continue to disrupt the Company\u2019s supply chain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which may adversely affect Quad\u2019s and its client\u2019s and suppliers\u2019 liquidity, cost of capital and ability to access the capital markets. As a result, the pandemic could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity as well as the ability of the Company\u2019s clients to perform, including in making timely payments to Quad, which could further adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and supply chain, although the full extent is still uncertain. As the pandemic continues to evolve, the extent of the impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and supply chain will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration of the pandemic (including any continuing relapses), the actions to contain the virus and/or treat its impact, restrictions on travel, the duration, timing and severity of the impact on client spending and consumer demand, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIn addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, future natural disasters, epidemics, other public health crises, conflicts, wars, terrorist attacks, fires or other catastrophic events affecting the Company\u2019s plants, distribution centers or other facilities, could also materially disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and result in an adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which could force the Company to reassess its strategic alternatives involving certain of its operations.\nDecreasing demand for printing services caused by factors outside of the Company\u2019s control, including the substitution of printed products with digital content, the COVID-19 pandemic and recent recessions, as well as significant downward pricing pressure, may continue to adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company and the overall printing industry continues to experience a reduction in demand for printed materials and overcapacity due to various factors including the sustained and increasing shift of digital substitution by marketers and advertisers (to both replace and augment campaigns that were historically focused on print), as well as the COVID-19 pandemic and recent recessions (which have severely impacted print volumes and further accelerated the impact of media disruption). The impacts of overcapacity, as well as intense competition, have led to the Company experiencing significant downward pricing pressures for printing services in recent years and such pricing may continue to decline from current levels. Any future increases in the supply of printing services or decreases in demand could cause prices to continue to decline, and prolonged periods of low prices, weak demand and/or excess supply could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business growth, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe media landscape is experiencing rapid change due to the impact of digital media and content on printed products. Improvements in the accessibility and quality of digital media through the online distribution and hosting of media content, mobile technologies, e-reader technologies, digital retailing and the digital distribution of documents and data has resulted and may continue to result in increased consumer substitution. Continued consumer acceptance of such digital media, as an alternative to print materials, is uncertain and difficult to predict and may decrease the demand for the Company\u2019s printed products, result in reduced pricing for its printing services and additional excess capacity in the printing industry, and adversely affect the results of the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive environment.\nThe advertising and marketing services industries are highly competitive and are expected to remain so. Any failure on the part of the Company to compete effectively in the markets it serves could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows and could require changes to the way it conducts its business or require it to reassess strategic alternatives involving its operations.\nThe Company operates primarily in the commercial print portion of the printing industry, which is highly fragmented and competitive in both the United States and internationally. The Company competes for business not only with large and mid-sized printers, but also with smaller regional printers and the growing forms of digital alternatives to print. In certain circumstances, due primarily to factors such as freight rates and client preference for local services, printers with better access to certain regions of a given country may be preferred by clients in such regions.\nSome of the industries that the Company services have been subject to consolidation efforts, leading to a smaller number of potential clients. Furthermore, if the smaller clients of the Company are consolidated with larger companies using other printing companies, the Company could lose its clients to competing printing companies.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by increases in its operating costs, including the cost and availability of raw materials, labor-related costs, fuel and other energy costs and freight rates.\nThe primary raw materials that the Company uses in its print business are paper, ink and energy. The price of such raw materials has fluctuated over time and has caused fluctuations in the Company\u2019s net sales and cost of sales. This volatility may continue and the Company may experience increases in the costs of its raw materials in the future as prices in the overall paper, ink and energy markets are expected to remain beyond its control.\nApproximately half of the paper used by the Company is supplied directly by its clients. For those clients that do not directly supply their own paper, the Company generally includes price adjustment clauses in sales contracts for paper and other critical raw materials in the printing process. Although these clauses generally mitigate paper price risk, higher paper prices and tight paper supplies may have an impact on client demand for printed products. If the Company passes along increases in the cost of paper and the price of the Company\u2019s products and services increases as a result, client demand could be adversely affected, and thereby, negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial performance. If the Company is unable to continue to pass along increases in the cost of paper to its clients, future increases in paper costs would adversely affect its margins and profits.\nDue to the significance of paper in the Company\u2019s print business, it is dependent on the availability of paper. In periods of high demand, certain paper grades have been in short supply, including grades used in the Company\u2019s business. In addition, during periods of tight supply, many paper producers allocate shipments of paper based upon historical purchase levels of clients. Additionally, the declining number of paper suppliers has resulted in a contraction in the overall paper manufacturing industry. This contraction of suppliers may cause overall supply issues, may cause certain paper grades to be in short supply or unavailable, and may cause paper prices to substantially increase.\nAlthough historically the Company generally has not experienced significant difficulty in obtaining adequate quantities of paper, continued decline in suppliers, changes in United States import or trade regulations, or other unforeseen developments in the overall paper markets (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) could result in a decrease in the supply of paper and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues or profits. In addition, the Company may not be able to resell waste paper and other by-products or the prices received for their sale may decline substantially.\nThe Company is dependent upon the vendors within the Company\u2019s supply chain to maintain a steady supply of inventory, parts and materials. Many of the Company\u2019s products are dependent upon a limited number of vendors, and significant disruptions could adversely affect operations (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic). Under current market conditions, and in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that one or more of the Company\u2019s vendors will be unable to fulfill their operating obligations due to financial hardships, liquidity issues or other reasons.\nThe Company generally cannot pass on to clients the impact of higher electric and natural gas energy prices on its manufacturing costs, and increases in energy prices result in higher manufacturing costs for certain of its operations.\nLabor represents a significant component of the cost structure of the Company. Increases in wages, salaries and the cost of medical, dental, pension and other post-retirement benefits, including increases from the COVID-19 pandemic, may impact the Company\u2019s financial performance. Changes in interest rates, investment returns or the regulatory environment may impact the amounts the Company will be required to contribute to the pension plans that it sponsors and may affect the solvency of these pension plans. The Company may be unable to achieve labor productivity targets, to retain employees or labor may not be adequately available in locations in which the Company operates, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nFreight rates and fuel costs also represent a significant component of the Company\u2019s cost structure. In general, the Company has been able to pass along increases in the cost of freight and fuel to many of its clients. If the Company is not able to pass along a substantial portion of increases in freight rates or in the price of fuel, future increases in these items would adversely impact the Company\u2019s margin and profits. If the Company passes along increases in the cost of freight and fuel and the price of the Company\u2019s products and services increases as a result, client demand could be adversely affected, and thereby, negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe Company may not be able to reduce costs and improve its operating efficiency rapidly enough to meet market conditions.\nBecause the markets in which the Company competes are highly competitive, the Company will need to continue to improve its operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve its profitability. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s continuing cost reduction efforts will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated productivity, cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. If the Company\u2019s efforts are not successful, it could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and competitive position. In addition, the need to reduce ongoing operating costs have and, in the future, may continue to result in significant up-front costs to reduce workforce, close or consolidate facilities, or upgrade equipment and technology.\nThe Company\u2019s transformation to a marketing solutions partner increases the complexity of the Company\u2019s business, and if the Company is unable to successfully adapt its business processes as required by these new markets, the Company will be at a competitive disadvantage and its ability to grow will be adversely affected.\nAs the Company expands its integrated marketing platform, the overall complexity of the Company\u2019s business increases at an accelerated rate and the Company becomes subject to different market dynamics. The new markets into\nwhich the Company is expanding, or may expand, may have different characteristics from the markets in which the Company historically competed. These different characteristics may include, among other things, demand volume requirements, demand seasonality, product generation development rates, client concentrations and performance and compatibility requirements. The Company\u2019s failure to make the necessary adaptations to its business model to address these different characteristics, complexities and new market dynamics could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nChanges in postal rates, postal regulations and postal services may adversely impact clients\u2019 demand for print products and services.\nPostal costs are a significant component of the cost structures of many of the Company\u2019s clients and potential clients. Postal rate changes and USPS regulations that result in higher overall costs can influence the volume that these clients will be willing to print and ultimately send through the USPS.\nIntegrated distribution with the postal service is an important component of the Company\u2019s business. Any material change in the current service levels provided by the postal service could impact the demand that clients have for print services. The USPS continues to experience financial problems. Without increased revenues or action by Congress to reform the USPS\u2019 cost structure, these losses will continue into the future. As a result of these financial difficulties, the USPS has come under increased pressure to adjust its postal rates and service levels. Additional price increases may result in clients reducing mail volumes and exploring the use of alternative methods for delivering a larger portion of their products, such as continued diversion to the internet and other alternative media channels in order to ensure that they stay within their expected postage budgets. There are also continued risks of delivery delays due to ongoing COVID-19 impacts on daily operational staffing at the USPS.\nThe USPS offers \u201cwork-share\u201d discounts that provide incentives to co-mail and place product as far down the mail-stream as possible. Discounts are earned as a result of less handling of the mail, and therefore, lower costs for the USPS. As a result, the Company has made substantial investments in co-mailing technology and equipment to ensure clients benefit from these discounts. As the USPS reacts to its financial difficulties, it often revises design standards for mail entering its system. These design standards often increase costs for clients and, in turn, decrease the value of the cost reductions that the Company\u2019s co-mailing services provide. If the incentives to co-mail are decreased by USPS regulations, the overall cost to mail printed products will increase and may result in print volumes declining.\nFederal statute requires the Postal Regulatory Commission (\u201cPRC\u201d) to conduct reviews of the overall rate-making structure for the USPS to ensure funding stability. As a result of those reviews, the PRC has authorized a new five year rate-making structure that would provide the USPS with additional pricing flexibility over the current Consumer Price Index cap, which may result in a substantially altered rate structure for mailers. The newly revised rate authority that is effective as a result of new rules issued by the PRC includes a higher overall rate cap on the USPS\u2019 ability to increase rates from year to year. This may lead to price spikes for mailers and may also reduce the incentive for the USPS to continue to take out costs and instead continue to rely on postage to cover the costs of an outdated postal service that does not reflect the industry\u2019s ability or willingness to pay. The uncertainty as to the actual rate increases due to competing lawsuits from both industry and the USPS, as well as how much of the authority the USPS will use, also creates potential volume declines as rate predictability with respect to cost and timing is no longer known for mailers. The result may be reduced demand for printed products as clients may move more aggressively into other delivery methods, such as the many digital and mobile options now available to consumers.\nThe Company may suffer a data-breach of sensitive information. If the Company\u2019s efforts to protect the security of such information are unsuccessful, any such failure may result in costly government enforcement actions and/or private litigation, and the Company\u2019s business and reputation could suffer.\nThe Company and its clients are subject to various United States and foreign cyber-security laws, which require the Company to maintain adequate protections for electronically held information. The Company may not be able to anticipate techniques used to gain access to the Company\u2019s systems or facilities, the systems of the Company\u2019s clients or vendors, or implement adequate prevention measures. Moreover, unauthorized parties may attempt to access the Company\u2019s systems or facilities, or the systems of the Company\u2019s clients or vendors, through fraud or deception. In the event and to the extent that a data breach occurs, such breach could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business\nand results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require changes to the Company\u2019s business practices in a manner adverse to the Company\u2019s business.\nNegative publicity could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nUnfavorable publicity, whether accurate or not, related to the Company or the Company\u2019s executive management team, employees, board of directors, operations, business or prospects, or to the Quadracci family shareholders of the Company, could negatively affect the Company\u2019s reputation, stock price, ability to attract new clients from growth vertical industries, ability to attract and retain high-quality talent, or the performance of the Company\u2019s business.\nIn addition, there has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms, including blogs, social media websites, and other forms of internet-based and mobile communications, which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers\u2019 and participants\u2019 post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. Information or commentary posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to the Company\u2019s interests or may be inaccurate, each of which may harm the Company\u2019s reputation, business or prospects. The harm may be immediate without affording the Company an opportunity for redress or correction.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends substantially on client contract renewals and/or client retention. Any contract non-renewals, renewals on different terms and conditions or decline in the Company\u2019s client retention or expansion could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company has historically derived a significant portion of its revenue from long-term contracts with significant clients. If the Company loses significant clients (including as a result of reduced demand for a client\u2019s products or services stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic), is unable to renew such contracts on similar terms and conditions, or at all, or is not awarded new long-term contracts with important clients in the future, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nThe Company is exposed to risks of loss in the event of nonperformance by its clients. Some of the Company\u2019s clients are highly leveraged or otherwise subject to their own operating and regulatory risks. Even if the Company\u2019s credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly, the Company may experience financial losses and loss of future business if its clients become bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise are unable to pay the Company for its work performed, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any increase in the nonpayment or nonperformance by clients could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain industries in which the Company\u2019s clients operate are experiencing consolidation. When client consolidation occurs, it is possible that the volume of work performed by the Company for a client after the consolidation will be less than it was before the consolidation or that the client\u2019s work will be completely moved to competitors. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices, may affect clients. The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, and the reliance on digital retailing may reduce clients\u2019 volume. Any such reduction or loss of work could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the Company fails to identify, manage, complete and integrate acquisitions, investment opportunities or other significant transactions, as well as identify and execute strategic divestitures, it may adversely affect the Company\u2019s future results and ability to implement its business strategy.\nThe Company may pursue acquisitions of, investment opportunities in, or other significant transactions with, companies that are complementary to the Company\u2019s business, as well as divestitures of businesses, product lines or other assets. In order to pursue this strategy successfully, the Company must identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities, successfully complete the transaction, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as integration of the acquired company or employees. The Company may not be able to identify or complete appealing acquisition or investment opportunities given the intense competition for these transactions. Even if the\nCompany identifies and completes suitable corporate transactions, the Company may not be able to successfully address inherent risks in a timely manner, or at all. These inherent risks include, among other things: failure to achieve all or any projected synergies, performance targets or other anticipated benefits of the acquisition, investment or divestiture; failure to successfully integrate the purchased operations, technologies, products or services and maintain uniform standard controls, policies and procedures; substantial unanticipated integration costs; loss of key employees, including those of an acquired business; diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; failure to retain the clients of the acquired business; additional debt and/or assumption of known or unknown liabilities; potential dilutive issuances of equity securities; and a write-off of goodwill, client lists, other intangibles and amortization of expenses. If the Company fails to successfully integrate an acquisition, the Company may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, and the Company\u2019s future results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the acceleration of the Company\u2019s transformation to a marketing solutions partner is partially dependent upon the Company\u2019s continued ability to identify and execute strategic divestiture opportunities to generate cash and related benefits. There can be no assurance whether the strategic benefits and expected financial impact of any divestitures will be achieved.\nFuture declines in economic conditions may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIn general, demand for the Company\u2019s products and services is highly related to general economic conditions in the markets the Company\u2019s clients serve. Declines in economic conditions in the United States or in other countries in which the Company operates, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial results, and these impacts may be material. Because such declines in demand are difficult to predict, the Company or the industry may have increased excess capacity as a result. An increase in excess capacity has resulted, and may continue to result, in declines in prices for the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, a prolonged decline in the global economy and an uncertain economic outlook, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, has and could further reduce the demand in the printing industry. Economic weakness and constrained advertising spending have resulted, and may in the future result, in decreased revenue, operating margin, earnings and growth rates and difficulty in managing inventory levels and collecting accounts receivable. The Company has experienced, and expects to experience in the future, excess capacity and lower demand due to economic factors affecting consumers\u2019 and businesses\u2019 spending behavior, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for the Company to predict results of operations, financial position and cash flows and to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation and deployment of capital.\nFailure to attract and retain qualified talent across the enterprise could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, competitive position, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company continues to be substantially dependent on its production personnel to print the Company\u2019s products in a cost-effective and efficient manner that allows the Company to obtain new clients and to drive sales from the Company\u2019s existing clients. The Company believes that there is significant competition for production personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that the Company requires. The Company\u2019s ability to continue efficient operations, reduce production costs, and consolidate operations will depend, in large part, on the Company\u2019s success in recruiting, training, integrating and retaining sufficient numbers of production personnel to support the Company\u2019s production, cost savings and consolidation targets. New hires require extensive training and it may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. In addition, an increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in an increase in the wage rates that the Company must pay. As a result, the Company may incur additional costs to attract, train and retain employees, including expenditures related to salaries and benefits, and the Company may lose new, as well as existing, employees to competitors or other companies before the Company realizes the benefit of its investment in recruiting and training them. If the Company is unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of personnel, the Company\u2019s business would be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s future success also depends on its continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, and retain its executive management team, including its Chief Executive Officer, and other personnel for all areas of the organization.\nApproximately 1,400 of the Company\u2019s United States and international employees are covered by an industry wide agreement, a collective bargaining agreement or through a works council or similar arrangement. While the Company believes its employee relations are good and that the Company maintains an employee-centric culture, and there has not been any material disruption in operations resulting from labor disputes, a strike or other forms of labor protest affecting the Company\u2019s United States or international plants, distribution centers or other facilities in the future could materially disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and result in an adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which could force the Company to reassess its strategic alternatives involving certain of its operations.\nThe fragility of and decline in overall distribution channels may adversely impact clients\u2019 access to cost effective distribution of their advertising materials, and therefore may adversely impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe distribution channels of print products and services, including the newspaper industry, face significant competition from other sources of news, information and entertainment content delivery. If overall distribution channels, including newspaper distribution channels, continue to decline, the Company\u2019s clients may be adversely impacted by the lack of access to cost effective distribution of their advertising materials. In turn, this decline in cost effective distribution channels may force clients to use other avenues of distribution that may be at significantly higher cost, which may decrease demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, and thus adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere are additional risks associated with the Company\u2019s operations outside of the United States.\nNet sales from the Company\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiaries outside of the United States accounted for approximately 10% of its consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nAs a result, the Company is subject to the risks inherent in conducting business outside of the United States, including, but not limited to: the impact of economic and political instability; fluctuations in currency values, foreign-currency exchange rates, devaluation and conversion restrictions; exchange control regulations and other limits on the Company\u2019s ability to import raw materials or finished product; tariffs and other trade barriers; trade restrictions and economic embargoes by the United States or other countries; health concerns regarding infectious diseases (such as COVID-19), adverse weather or natural disasters; social unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war or other armed conflicts; inflation and fluctuations in interest rates; language barriers; difficulties in staffing, training, employee retention and managing international operations; logistical and communications challenges; differing local business practices and cultural consideration; restrictions on the ability to repatriate funds; foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources; longer accounts receivable payment cycles; potential adverse tax consequences and being subject to different legal and regulatory regimes that may preclude or make more costly certain initiatives or the implementation of certain elements of its business strategy.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company\u2019s debt facilities include various covenants imposing restrictions that may affect the Company\u2019s ability to operate its business.\nOn September 1, 1995, and as last amended on November 24, 2014, the Company entered into a senior secured note agreement (the \u201cMaster Note and Security Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which the Company has issued over time senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion in various tranches. As of December 31, 2020, the borrowings outstanding under the Master Note and Security Agreement were $15.6 million. On April 28, 2014, and as last amended on June 29, 2020, the Company entered into a senior secured credit facility (the \u201cSenior Secured Credit Facility,\u201d) which now includes two different loan facilities: an $825.0 million Term Loan A, and a $500.0 million revolving credit facility. The $500.0 million revolving credit facility and the $825.0 million Term Loan A both mature on January 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2020, the borrowings outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facility were $657.6 million. On April 28, 2014, the Company issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its unsecured 7.0% senior notes due May 1, 2022 (\u201cSenior Unsecured Notes,\u201d), of which $238.7 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Company\u2019s various lending arrangements include certain financial covenants. In addition to the financial covenants, the debt facilities also include certain limitations on acquisitions, indebtedness, liens, dividends and repurchases of capital stock. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants in its debt agreements. While the Company currently expects to be in compliance in future periods with all of the financial covenants, there can be no assurance that these covenants will continue to be met. The Company\u2019s failure to maintain compliance with the covenants could prevent the Company from borrowing additional amounts and could result in a default under any of the debt agreements. Such default could cause the outstanding indebtedness to become immediately due and payable, by virtue of cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.\nThe Company may be required to make capital expenditures to sustain its platforms and processes, in part to keep pace with industry developments and client expectations, and to remain technologically and economically competitive, which may increase its costs, reduce its profits, disrupt its operations or adversely affect its ability to implement its business strategy.\nThe printing and marketing services industries are experiencing rapid change as new digital technologies are developed that offer clients an array of choices for their marketing and publication needs. In order to remain competitive, the Company will need to adapt to future changes, especially with regard to technology, to enhance the Company\u2019s existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address the changing demands of clients. In order to remain technologically and economically competitive, the Company may need to make significant capital expenditures as it develops and continues to maintain its platforms and processes, and to develop and integrate new technologies. In order to accomplish this effectively, the Company will need to deploy its resources efficiently, maintain effective cost controls and bear potentially significant market and raw material risks. If the Company\u2019s revenues decline, it may impact the Company\u2019s ability to expend the capital necessary to develop and implement new technology and be economically competitive. Debt or equity financing, or cash generated from operations, may not be available or sufficient for these requirements or for other corporate purposes or, if debt or equity financing is available, it may not be on terms favorable to the Company. In addition, even if capital is available to the Company, there is risk that the Company\u2019s vendors will have discontinued the production of parts needed for repairs, replacements or improvements to the Company\u2019s existing platforms, leading the Company to expend more capital than expected to perform such repairs, replacements or improvements. The Company\u2019s business and operating results may be adversely affected if the Company is unable to keep pace with relevant technological and industry changes or if the technologies or business strategies that the Company adopts or services it promotes do not receive widespread market acceptance.\nIf the Company is unable to make the capital expenditures necessary to adapt to industry and technological developments, the Company may experience a decline in demand for its services, be unable to implement its business strategy and its business operating results may be adversely affected. Additionally, if the Company is unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, the Company could lose clients to competitors. In general, the development of new communication channels inside and outside the printing and media solutions industry requires the Company to anticipate and respond to the varied and continually changing demands of clients. The Company may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue, operating income from continuing operations and cash flows are subject to cyclical and seasonal variations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is seasonal, with the Company recognizing the majority of its operating income from continuing operations in the third and fourth quarters of the financial year, primarily as a result of the increased magazine advertising page counts and retail inserts and catalogs from back-to-school and holiday-related advertising and promotions. The fourth quarter is typically the highest seasonal quarter for cash flows from operating activities and Free Cash Flow due to the reduction of working capital requirements that reach peak levels during the third quarter. If the Company does not successfully manage the increased workflow, necessary increases in paper and ink inventory, production capacity flows and other business elements during these high seasons of activity, this seasonality could adversely affect the Company\u2019s cash flows and results of operations.\nAn other than temporary decline in operating results and enterprise value could lead to non-cash impairment charges due to the impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets.\nThe Company has a material amount of property, plant, equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets on its balance sheet, due in part to acquisitions. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had the following long-lived assets on its consolidated balance sheet included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K: (a) property, plant and equipment of $884.2 million; (b) goodwill of $103.0 million; and (c) other intangible assets, primarily representing the value of customer relationships acquired, of $104.3 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020, these assets represented approximately 57% of the Company\u2019s total assets. The Company assesses impairment of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets based upon the expected future cash flows of the respective assets. These valuations include management\u2019s estimates of sales, profitability, cash flow generation, capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditures and other assumptions. A decline in expected profitability, significant negative industry or economic trends (including the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic), inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets or in entity structure, divestitures and discontinued operations may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations. As a result, the recoverability of these assets could be called into question, and the Company could be required to write down or write off these assets. Such an occurrence could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by interest rates, particularly floating interest rates, and foreign exchange rates.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 30% of the Company\u2019s borrowings were subject to variable interest rates. As a result, the Company is exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates, and increases in interest rates could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company currently holds two interest rate swap contracts. The purpose of entering into these contracts is to reduce the variability of cash flows from interest payments related to a portion of the Company\u2019s variable-rate debt. The swaps convert the notional value of the Company\u2019s variable rate debt based on one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) to a fixed rate, including a spread on underlying debt, and a monthly reset in the variable interest rate.\nBecause a portion of the Company\u2019s operations are outside of the United States, significant revenues and expenses are denominated in local currencies. Although operating in local currencies may limit the impact of currency rate fluctuations on the results of operations of the Company\u2019s non-United States subsidiaries and business units, fluctuations in such rates may affect the translation of these results into the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. To the extent revenues and expenses are not in the applicable local currency, the Company may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the currency risk. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company\u2019s efforts at hedging will be successful. There is always a possibility that attempts to hedge currency risks will lead to greater losses than predicted.\nThe Company has significant liabilities with respect to defined benefit pension plans that could cause the Company to incur additional costs.\nAs a result of the 2010 acquisition of World Color Press, the Company assumed frozen single employer defined benefit pension plans for certain of its employees in the United States. The majority of the plans\u2019 assets are held in North American and global equity securities and debt securities. The asset allocation as of December 31, 2020, was approximately 30% equity securities and 70% debt securities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had underfunded pension liabilities of $56.6 million for single employer defined benefit plans in the United States. Under current United States pension law, pension funding deficits are generally required to be funded over a seven-year period. These pension deficits may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates, pension plan investment performance, pension legislation and other factors. Declines in global debt and equity markets would increase the Company\u2019s potential pension funding obligations. Any significant increase in the Company\u2019s required contributions could have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition to the single employer defined benefit plans described above, the Company has previously participated in multiemployer pension plans (\u201cMEPPs\u201d) in the United States, including the Graphic Communications International Union - Employer Retirement Fund (\u201cGCIU\u201d) and the Graphic Communications Conference of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters National Pension Fund (\u201cGCC\u201d). Prior to the acquisition of World Color Press by the Company, World Color Press received notice that certain plans in which it participated were in critical status, as defined in Section 432 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cInternal Revenue Code\u201d). As a result, the Company could have been subject to increased contribution rates associated with these plans or other MEPPs suffering from declines in their funding levels. Due to the significantly underfunded status of the United States multiemployer plans and the potential increased contribution rates, the Company withdrew from participation in these multiemployer plans and has replaced these pension benefits with a Company-sponsored \u201cpay as you go\u201d defined contribution plan, which is historically the form of retirement benefit provided to the Company\u2019s employees. As of December 31, 2020, the Company estimates and has recorded in its financial statements a pre-tax withdrawal liability for all United States MEPPs of $35.7 million in the aggregate. The Company is scheduled to make payments to the GCIU and GCC until April 2032 and February 2024, respectively.\nThe Company may not be able to utilize deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, of $120.0 million. The Company expects to utilize the deferred tax assets to reduce consolidated income tax liabilities in future taxable years. However, the Company may not be able to fully utilize the deferred tax assets if its future taxable income and related income tax liability is insufficient to permit their use. In addition, in the future, the Company may be required to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets if the Company believes it is unable to utilize them, which would have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nThe Company and its facilities are subject to various consumer protection and privacy laws and regulations, and will become subject to additional laws and regulations in the future. If the Company\u2019s efforts to comply with such laws or protect the security of information are unsuccessful, any failure may subject the Company to material liability, require it to incur material costs or otherwise adversely affect its results of operations as a result of compliance with such laws, costly enforcement actions and private litigation.\nThe nature of the Company\u2019s business includes the receipt and storage of information about the Company\u2019s clients, vendors and the end-users of the Company\u2019s products and services. The Company and its clients are subject to various United States and foreign consumer protection, information security, data privacy and \u201cdo not mail\u201d requirements at the federal, states, provincial and local levels. The Company is subject to many legislative and regulatory laws and regulations around the world concerning data protection and privacy. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States and elsewhere are often fluid and uncertain. To the extent that the Company or its clients become subject to additional or more stringent requirements or that the Company is not successful in its efforts to comply with existing requirements or protect the security of information, demand for the Company\u2019s services may decrease and the Company\u2019s reputation may suffer, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. In addition, such laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with the Company\u2019s internal policies. If so, the Company could suffer costly enforcement actions (including an order requiring changes to the Company\u2019s data practices) and private litigation, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require changes to the Company\u2019s business practices in a manner adverse to the Company\u2019s business.\nUnfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings could result in substantial costs and may harm the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition may be affected by the outcome of pending and future litigation, claims, investigations, legal and administrative cases and proceedings, whether civil or criminal, or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties. For example, in late 2019, two substantially similar actions, which have now been consolidated, were filed by purported shareholders against the Company and certain of the Company\u2019s officers alleging that the Company and those officers misrepresented and/or omitted material information in the Company\u2019s public filings prior to the earnings release for the third quarter of 2019, rendering statements therein allegedly false and misleading and in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and related regulations. The actions seek to recover unspecified damages, and costs and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 and expert fees. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these or any such claims, any similar future litigation, or any other legal proceedings to which the Company is subject, can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s liquidity and financial condition and/or cause significant reputational harm to the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company may incur costs or suffer reputational damage due to improper conduct of its employees, contractors or agents under laws governing business practices, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nThe Company could be adversely affected by engaging in business practices that are in violation of United States or foreign anti-corruption laws, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Company operates in parts of the world with developing economies that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. In certain countries, the Company does substantial business with government entities or instrumentalities, which creates increased risk of a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and international laws. There can be no assurance that all of the Company\u2019s employees, contractors or agents, including those representing the Company in countries where practices which violate anti-corruption laws may be customary, will not take actions that violate the Company\u2019s policies and procedures. The failure to comply with the laws governing international business practices may result in substantial penalties and fines.\nChanges in the legal and regulatory environment could limit the Company\u2019s business activities, increase its operating costs, reduce demand for its products or result in litigation.\nThe conduct of the Company\u2019s businesses is subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local government agencies in the United States, as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets in which the Company operates. These laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change, sometimes dramatically, as a result of political, economic or social events, such as the election of the new administration. Such regulatory environment changes may include changes in taxation requirements, accounting and disclosure standards, immigration laws and policy, environmental laws, and requirements of United States and foreign occupational health and safety laws. Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which the Company does business, and therefore, may impact its results or increase its costs or liabilities.\nIn addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal and environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as environmental remediation and related indemnification proceedings in connection with certain historical activities, former facilities and contractual obligations of acquired businesses. Permits are required for the operation of certain parts of the Company\u2019s business, and these permits are subject to renewal, modification and, in some circumstances, revocation. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs the Company has estimated. The Company cannot assure you that the Company\u2019s costs in relation to these matters will not exceed its established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on its results of operations.\nVarious laws and regulations addressing climate change are being considered at the federal and state levels. Proposals under consideration include limitations on the amount of greenhouse gas that can be emitted (so-called \u201ccaps\u201d) together with systems of trading allowed emissions capacities. The impacts of such proposals could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIf QuadMed, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, fails to comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, the Company could face substantial penalties, and its business, reputation, operations, prospects and financial condition of the Company\u2019s subsidiary could be adversely affected.\nQuadMed provides employer-sponsored healthcare solutions in the United States to employers of all sizes, including the Company and other private and public-sector companies. These solutions include, but are not limited to, on-site and near-site healthcare clinics, occupational health services, telemedicine, and health and wellness programs. The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, constantly evolving and subject to significant change and fluctuation. The United States federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that impact the QuadMed subsidiary business include, among others, those: (a) regarding privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; (b) prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration to induce the referral of an individual for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of an item or service for which payment may be made under healthcare programs; (c) prohibiting, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing to be presented claims for payment from third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; and (d) prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine.\nRisks Relating to Quad\u2019s Common Stock\nHolders of class A common stock are not able to independently elect directors of the Company or control any of the Company\u2019s management policies or business decisions because the holders of class A common stock have substantially less voting power than the holders of the Company\u2019s class B common stock, all of which is owned by certain members of the Quadracci family, trusts for their benefit or other affiliates of the Company, whose interests may be different from the holders of class A common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s outstanding stock is divided into two classes of common stock: class A common stock (\u201cclass A stock\u201d) and class B common stock (\u201cclass B stock\u201d). The class B stock has ten votes per share on all matters and the class A stock is entitled to one vote per share. As of January 31, 2021, the class B stock constitutes approximately 77% of the Company\u2019s total voting power. As a result, holders of class B stock are able to exercise a controlling influence over the Company\u2019s business, have the power to elect its directors and indirectly control decisions such as whether to issue additional shares, declare and pay dividends or enter into corporate transactions. All of the class B stock is owned by certain members of the Quadracci family or trusts for their benefit, whose interests may differ from the interests of the holders of class A stock.\nAs of January 31, 2021, approximately 93% of the outstanding class B stock was held of record by the Quad Voting Trust, and that constitutes approximately 71% of the Company\u2019s total voting power. The trustees of the Quad Voting Trust have the authority to vote the stock held by the Quad Voting Trust. Accordingly, the trustees of the Quad Voting Trust are able to exercise a controlling influence over the Company\u2019s business, have the power to elect its directors and indirectly control decisions such as whether to issue additional shares, declare and pay dividends or enter into corporate transactions.\nFurthermore, in response to recent public focus on dual class capital structures, certain stock index providers are implementing limitations on the inclusion of dual class share structures in their indices. If these restrictions increase, they may impact who buys and holds the Company\u2019s stock.\nThe Company is a controlled company within the meaning of the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) and, as a result, it relies on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to shareholders of other companies.\nSince the Quad Voting Trust owns more than 50% of the total voting power of the Company\u2019s stock, the Company is considered a controlled company under the corporate governance listing standards of the NYSE. As a\ncontrolled company, an exception under the NYSE listing standards exempts the Company from the obligation to comply with certain of the NYSE\u2019s corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that (a) the Company have a corporate governance and nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and (b) the Company have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nAccordingly, for so long as the Company is a controlled company, holders of class A stock may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.", "PERMNO": 12009, "SIC": 2750, "TIC": "QUAD"}
