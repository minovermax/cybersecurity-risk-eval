{"cik": "1000228", "company": "HENRY SCHEIN INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business operations could be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations, so you should not consider the risks disclosed in this section to necessarily represent a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties. The Company believes that the following risks could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial results, financial condition and/or the trading price of our common stock. The order in which these factors appear does not necessarily reflect their relative importance or priority.\nCOMPANY RISKS\nOur business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity may be negatively impacted by the effects of disease outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, or similar wide-spread public health concerns and other natural disasters. The COVID-19 pandemic and the responses of governments to it had, and may again have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows and may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.\nOur business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity may be negatively impacted by the\neffects of disease outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, similar wide-spread public health concerns and other natural disasters. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, an unprecedented impact on society, worldwide economic activity, and the health care sector (particularly, the dental market). As a global healthcare solutions company, the COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental responses to it had, and may again have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows and may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has begun to subside, we may again experience material adverse impacts to our business, results of operations and cash flows as a result of, among other things, its global economic impact, including any recession that may occur in the future, or a prolonged period of economic slowdown or the reluctance of patients to return for elective dental or medical care. The impacts and potential impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 Significant volatility in supply, demand and selling prices for personal protective equipment (PPE), COVID-19 tests and other COVID-19 related products. Available supply, customer demand and selling prices for PPE, COVID-19 tests and other COVID-19 related products fluctuated in fiscal 2021 and we expect such volatility to continue for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has resulted in inventory reserves, fluctuating margins and increased revenue related to such products. Although we have experienced significant growth in sales volumes for PPE, COVID-19 tests and other COVID-19 related products during the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that such growth in sales volumes will be maintained during or following the COVID-19 pandemic. Our estimates for supply, demand and selling prices are inherently uncertain and if supply, demand, selling prices or other market dynamics significantly fluctuate in the future beyond our current assumptions, additional inventory reserves may be required, margins may be reduced and/or revenue may decline for such products, each which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, governmental policies designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and variants thereof could once again lead to the closure of dental offices or deferral of elective procedures and wellness exams by medical and dental patients. Such previous closures and restrictions impacted our customers\u2019 spending with us and had, and if reinstated may again have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. Although we believe that most practices currently are able to access adequate supply, we still may be unable to supply our customers with the specific brand and/or quantity of certain PPE products, COVID-19 tests and other COVID-19 related products they demand, which may lead to our customers seeking alternative sources of supply. Healthcare professionals\u2019 inability to obtain a sufficient quantity and/or brand of certain PPE, COVID-19 tests and other COVID-19 related products would adversely impact our business, results of operations and cash flows, and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity;\n\u2022 Reduction in Peoples\u2019 Ability and Willingness to be in Public. Restrictions recommended by several public health organizations, and implemented, from time to time, by federal, state and local governments, to slow and limit the transmission of COVID-19 and variants thereof has caused and may in the future cause some people to be less willing to go to elective medical and dental appointments, which could again materially adversely affect demand for our products. A lengthened period of materially suppressed demand could again cause material adverse impacts on our business, results of operations and cash flows and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity;\n\u2022 Potential delays in customer payments, or defaults on our customer credit arrangements. We generally sell products to customers with payment terms. If customers\u2019 cash flows or operating and financial performance deteriorate due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment to us. Likewise, for similar reasons, suppliers may restrict credit or impose more stringent payment terms. The inability of current and/or potential customers to pay us for our products and/or services or any demands by suppliers for more stringent payment terms may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity and may limit the amounts we can borrow under our trade accounts receivable securitization;\n\u2022 Impact on third parties\u2019 ability to meet their obligations to us; impact on our ability to meet obligations to third parties. Failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors (including third-party shippers), joint venture partners and external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties, travel restrictions and border closures and/or other domestic and global supply chain disruptions, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity. Certain of our contracts with supply partners contain minimum purchase requirements or include rebate provisions if we satisfy certain sales or purchasing targets that, in certain cases we have not been able to satisfy and in other cases we may not be able to fully satisfy, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our failure to satisfy such contractual provisions or renegotiate more favorable terms could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows;\n\u2022 Negative impact on our workforce and impact of adapted business practices. The spread of COVID-19 and variants thereof caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, employee work locations, and physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or our customers or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, we will continue to evaluate appropriate actions for our business. Many of our employees shifted abruptly to working remotely and our office-based workers who are able to work from home continue to do so. An extended period of modified business practices and remote work arrangements could have a negative impact on employee morale, strain our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk (including but not limited to cybersecurity risks), and impair our ability to efficiently operate our business;\n\u2022 Significant changes in political conditions. Significant changes in political conditions in markets in which we purchase and distribute our products have occurred and are expected to continue at least during the pendency of the pandemic, including quarantines, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating facilities, restrict our employees\u2019 ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise constrain the operations of our business partners, suppliers or customers, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity;\n\u2022 Potential impact on our ability to meet obligations under credit facilities. An extended negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity could impact our ability to meet our obligations under credit facilities or outstanding long term debt, which contain maximum leverage ratios, and customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants;\n\u2022 Volatility in the financial markets. Volatility in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us;\n\u2022 Refocusing management resources to mitigate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our management is focused on\nmitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has required, and may continue to require for the duration of the pandemic, a large investment of time and resources across the Company, and may delay certain strategic and other plans, which could materially adversely affect our business;\n\u2022 Potential increased costs associated with our self-insured medical insurance programs. We may incur significant employee health care costs under our self-insurance medical insurance programs if a large number of our employees and/or their covered family members become ill from COVID-19 and variants thereof;\n\u2022 Vaccination or testing mandates. The imposition of government or customer mandated vaccination or testing mandates may impact our ability to retain current employees, attract new employees and retain certain product and service contracts. It is possible that a significant number of our employees have not been vaccinated, and in the event of a vaccine mandate some of those employees may seek exemptions or otherwise resist vaccination. The imposition of vaccine mandates could potentially cause labor shortages if employees refuse to get vaccinated and their employment is terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Such labor shortages could also affect our ability to retain certain specific contracts to which the mandates may apply, reduce our sales and/or affect our ability to fulfill customer orders, impacting our revenue and profitability. Furthermore, managing and tracking vaccination status and ongoing testing for exempt and/or unvaccinated employees could potentially increase our costs, as could addressing inconsistent mandates. COVID-19 vaccine mandates and similar regulations have the potential to materially adversely affect our business, as the scope, nature and effect of such mandates are uncertain at this time; and\n\u2022 Reputational risk associated with response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If we do not respond appropriately to the COVID-19 pandemic, or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brands, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed below, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products.\nWe obtain substantially all of the products we distribute from third parties, with whom we generally do not have long-term contracts. While there is typically more than one source of supply, some key suppliers, in the aggregate, supply a significant portion of the products we sell. In 2021, our top 10 health care distribution suppliers and our single largest supplier accounted for approximately 30% and 4%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases. Because of our dependence upon such suppliers, our operations are subject to the suppliers\u2019 ability and willingness to supply products in the quantities that we require, and the risks include delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control, including a supplier\u2019s failure to comply with applicable government requirements (which may result in product recalls and/or cessation of sales) or an interruption in the suppliers\u2019 manufacturing capabilities. In the event of any such interruption in supply, we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis. There is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis, if at all, and an extended interruption in supply, particularly of a high sales volume product, could result in a significant disruption in our sales and operations, as well as damage to our relationships with customers and our reputation. In addition, certain of our suppliers have had their ability to service certain markets restricted or negatively impacted because of allegations of forced labor in their supply chain. Forced labor legislation affecting the supply chain has increased around the world, and the United States recently passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. Our supply chain could be materially disrupted if our suppliers fail to comply with, or are unable to satisfy our demand for products, as a result of applicable forced labor legislation and regulations.\nOur future growth (especially for our technology and value-added services segment) is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire and maintain and protect new products and technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins.\nOur future success depends on our ability to timely develop (or obtain the right to sell) competitive and innovative (particularly for our technology and value-added services segment) products and services and to market them\nquickly and cost-effectively. Our ability to anticipate customer needs and emerging trends and develop or acquire new products, services and technologies at competitive prices requires significant resources, including employees with the requisite skills, experience and expertise, particularly in our technology segment, including dental practice management, patient engagement and demand creation software solutions. The failure to successfully address these challenges could materially disrupt our sales and operations. Additionally, our software and e-services products, like software products generally, may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released. Any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with customers as well as our reputation. With respect to certain software and e-services that we develop, we rely primarily upon copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual and common law protections and confidentiality obligations. We cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available, adequate or enforceable in a timely manner to protect our software or e-services products.\nOur expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks and may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect.\nOne of our business strategies has been to expand our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future. Such transactions require significant management attention, may place significant demands on our operations, information systems and financial resources, and there is risk that one or more may not succeed. We cannot be sure, for example, that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or joint ventures or that we will avoid unforeseen additional costs or expenses. Our ability to successfully implement our acquisition and joint venture strategy depends upon, among other things, the following:\n\u2022 the availability of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates at acceptable prices;\n\u2022 our ability to consummate such transactions, which could potentially be prohibited due to U.S. or foreign antitrust regulations;\n\u2022 the liquidity of our investments and the availability of financing on acceptable terms;\n\u2022 our ability to retain customers or product lines of the acquired businesses or joint ventures;\n\u2022 our ability to retain, recruit and incentivize the management of the companies we acquire; and\n\u2022 our ability to successfully integrate these companies\u2019 operations, services, products and personnel with our culture, management policies, internal procedures, working capital management, financial and operational controls and strategies.\nFurthermore, some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may give rise to an obligation to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations, which payments could have material adverse impacts on our financial results individually or in the aggregate.\nCertain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage third parties from seeking to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.\nThe provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, may discourage acquisition bids and may impact the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions, among other things require (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 60% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote to approve a merger, consolidation, or a sale, lease, transfer or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets; and (ii) the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our common stock entitled to vote to (a) remove a director; and (b) to amend or repeal our by-laws, with certain limited exceptions. In addition, certain of our employee incentive plans provide for accelerated vesting of stock options and other awards upon termination without cause within two years following a change in control, or grant the plan committee discretion to accelerate awards upon a change of control. Further, certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments and certain benefits if those executive officers are terminated without cause by us or if they terminate for good reason, in each case within two years following a change in control or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control or after the first public announcement of the pendency of the change in control.\nINDUSTRY RISKS\nThe health care products distribution industry is highly competitive (including, without limitation, competition from third-party online commerce sites) and consolidating, and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nWe compete with numerous companies, including several major manufacturers and distributors. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which could allow them to compete more successfully. Most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors. Competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products, which we would then be unable to market. Manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to end-users and thereby eliminate or reduce our role in distribution. Industry consolidation among health care product distributors and manufacturers, price competition, product unavailability, whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in manufacturing supply, or the emergence of new competitors, also could increase competition. Consolidation has also increased among manufacturers of health care products, which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and product availability. We could be subject to charges and financial losses in the event we fail to satisfy minimum purchase commitments contained in some of our contracts. Additionally, traditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions. The continued advancement of online commerce by third parties will require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business (including with additional value-added services) to address changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis. The emergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe repeal or judicial prohibition on implementation of the Affordable Care Act could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe ACA greatly expanded health insurance coverage in the United States and has been the target of litigation and Congressional reform efforts since its adoption. The U.S. Supreme Court, in upholding the constitutionality of the ACA and its individual mandate provision in 2012, simultaneously limited ACA provisions requiring Medicaid expansion, making such expansion a state-by-state decision. In 2017, the U.S. Congress effectively repealed the ACA\u2019s individual mandate provision by eliminating the financial penalty for non-compliance. In the most recent ACA litigation, a federal appeals court found the individual mandate to be unconstitutional, and returned the case to a lower federal court for consideration of whether the remainder of the ACA could survive the excision of the individual mandate. This decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court issued a decision on June 17, 2021. Without reaching the merits of the case, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs in the case did not have standing to challenge the ACA. Any outcome of future cases that change the ACA, in addition to future legislation, regulation, guidance and/or Executive Orders that do the same, could have a significant impact on the U.S. healthcare industry. For instance, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 enhanced premium tax credits, which has resulted in an expansion of the number of people covered under the ACA. These changes are time-limited, with some enhancements in place for 2021 only and others available through the end of 2022.\nThe health care industry is experiencing changes due to political, economic and regulatory influences that could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences. In recent years, the health care industry has undergone, and is in the process of undergoing, significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs, including, among other factors: trends toward managed care; collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among office-based health care practitioners; and changes in reimbursements to customers, including increased attention to value-based payment arrangements, as well as growing enforcement activities (and related monetary recoveries) by governmental officials. Both our profitability and the profitability of our customers may be materially adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and devices, and/or medical treatments or services, or changes to the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined. If we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the health care industry, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nExpansion of group purchasing organizations (\u201cGPO\u201d), dental support organizations (\u201cDSO\u201d) or provider networks and the multi-tiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe health care products industry is subject to a multi-tiered costing structure, which can vary by manufacturer and/or product. Under this structure, certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for health care products than we are able to obtain. The multi-tiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health care providers and others with significant purchasing power, such as GPOs and DSOs, demand more favorable pricing terms. Additionally, the formation of provider networks, GPOs and DSOs may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship and may threaten our ability to compete effectively, which could in turn negatively impact our financial results. Although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers to access lower prices demanded by GPO and DSO contracts or other contracts, and to develop relationships with existing and emerging provider networks, GPOs and DSOs, we cannot guarantee that such terms will be obtained or contracts executed.\nIncreases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers could harm our business.\nOur ability to meet our customers\u2019 expedited delivery expectations is an integral component of our business strategy for which our customers rely. Shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business. We ship almost all of our orders through third-party delivery services, and typically bear the cost of shipment. Accordingly, any significant increase in shipping rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. Similarly, strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers, including at transportation centers or shipping ports, could cause our operating expenses to rise and materially adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis.\nMACRO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS\nUncertain global macro-economic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nUncertain global macro-economic and political conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the United States, Europe, Asia and other parts of the world could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These uncertainties, include, among other things:\n\u2022 election results;\n\u2022 changes to laws and policies governing foreign trade (including, without limitation, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement of December 2020 and other international trade agreements);\n\u2022 greater restrictions on imports and exports;\n\u2022 supply chain disruptions;\n\u2022 changes in laws and policies governing health care or data privacy;\n\u2022 tariffs and sanctions;\n\u2022 changes to the relationship between the United States and China;\n\u2022 sovereign debt levels;\n\u2022 the inability of political institutions to effectively resolve actual or perceived economic, currency or budgetary crises or issues;\n\u2022 consumer confidence;\n\u2022 unemployment levels (and a corresponding increase in the uninsured and underinsured population);\n\u2022 changes in regulatory and tax regulations;\n\u2022 interest rate fluctuations;\n\u2022 availability of capital;\n\u2022 increases in fuel and energy costs;\n\u2022 the effect of inflation on our ability to procure products and our ability to increase prices over time and pass through to our customers price increases we may receive;\n\u2022 changes in tax rates and the availability of certain tax deductions;\n\u2022 increases in health care costs;\n\u2022 the threat or outbreak of war, terrorism or public unrest (including, without limitation, the possibility of war in the Ukraine and a wider European or global conflict); and\n\u2022 changes in laws and policies governing manufacturing, development and investment in territories and countries where we do business.\nAdditionally, changes in government, government debt and/or budget crises may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries, which could reduce overall health care spending, and/or higher income or corporate taxes, which could depress spending overall. Recessionary or inflationary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may also cause customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause suppliers to reduce their output or change their terms of sale. We generally sell products to customers with payment terms. If customers\u2019 cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorate, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not be able to, or may delay, payment to us. Likewise, for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment terms.\nREGULATORY AND LITIGATION RISKS\nFailure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe strive to be compliant with the applicable laws, regulations and guidance described below, and believe we have effective compliance programs and other controls in place to ensure substantial compliance. However, compliance is not guaranteed either now or in the future as certain laws, regulations and guidance may be subject to varying and evolving interpretations that could affect our ability to comply, as well as, future changes, additions and enforcement approaches, including in light of political changes. The Biden Administration has indicated that it will be more aggressive in its pursuing alleged violations of law, and it has revoked certain guidance that would have limited governmental use of informal agency guidance to pursue such violations, as well as indicating it was more prepared to pursue individuals for corporate law violations, including an aggressive approach to anti-corruption activities. Changes with respect to the applicable laws, regulations and guidance described below may require us to update or revise our operations, services, marketing practices, and compliance programs and controls, and may impose additional and unforeseen costs on us, pose new or previously immaterial risks to us, or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that current and future government regulations will not adversely affect our business, and we cannot predict new regulatory priorities, the form, content or timing of regulatory actions, and their impact on the health care industry and on our business and operations.\nGlobal efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing. In the United States, in addition to other government efforts to control health care costs, there has been increased scrutiny on drug pricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by Congress, the President, executive branch agencies and various states. At the state level, several states have adopted laws that require drug manufacturers to provide advance notice of certain price increases and to report information relating to those price increases, while others have taken legislative or administrative action to establish prescription drug affordability boards or multi-payer purchasing pools to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. At the federal level, several related bills have been introduced and regulations proposed which, if enacted or finalized, respectively, would impact drug pricing and related costs.\nUnder the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with covered recipients, including physicians, dentists, teaching hospitals, and certain other non-physician practitioners. We or our subsidiaries may be required to report information under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, can be unclear. We are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers. While we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place satisfying the above laws and requirements, such compliance imposes additional costs on us and the requirements are sometimes unclear. In the United States, government actions to seek to increase health-related price transparency may also affect our business.\nOur business is subject to additional requirements under various local, state, federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the sale and distribution of, and third-party payment for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices and HCT/P products. Among the federal laws with which we must comply are the Controlled Substances Act, the FDC Act, the Federal Drug Quality and Security Act, including DSCSA, and Section 361 of the Public Health Services Act. Among other things, such laws, and the regulations promulgated thereunder:\n\u2022 regulate the introduction, manufacture, advertising, marketing and promotion, sampling, pricing and reimbursement, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, returning or recalling, reporting, and distribution of, and record keeping for drugs, HCT/P products and medical devices, including requirements with respect to unique medical device identifiers;\n\u2022 subject us to inspection by the FDA and DEA and similar state authorities;\n\u2022 regulate the storage, transportation and disposal of certain of our products that are considered hazardous materials;\n\u2022 require us to advertise and promote our drugs and devices in accordance with applicable FDA requirements;\n\u2022 require registration with the FDA and the DEA and various state agencies;\n\u2022 require record keeping and documentation of transactions involving drug products;\n\u2022 require us to design and operate a system to identify and report suspicious orders of controlled substances to the DEA;\n\u2022 require us to manage returns of products that have been recalled and subject us to inspection of our recall procedures and activities;\n\u2022 impose on us reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical, HCT/P product or medical device causes serious illness, injury or death;\n\u2022 require manufacturers, wholesalers, repackagers and dispensers of prescription drugs to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed;\n\u2022 require the licensing of prescription drug wholesalers and third-party logistics providers; and\n\u2022 mandate compliance with standards for the recordkeeping, storage and handling of prescription drugs, and associated reporting requirements.\nThe FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software and digital health products intended for use in health care settings. The Cures Act, signed into law on December 13, 2016, among other things, amended the medical device definition to exclude certain software from FDA regulation, including certain clinical decision support software. On September 27, 2019, the FDA issued a suite of guidance documents on digital health products, which incorporated applicable Cures Act standards, including regarding the types of clinical decision support tools and other software that are exempt from regulation by the FDA as medical devices, and continues to issue new guidance in this area. Certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management, and it is possible that the FDA or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is subject to regulation as a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements, costs and potential enforcement actions or liabilities for noncompliance with respect to these products.\nApplicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, licensure or registration, program eligibility, procurement, third-party reimbursement, sales and marketing practices, product integrity and supply tracking to product manufacturers, product labeling, personnel, privacy and security of health or other personal information, installation, maintenance and repair of equipment and the importation and exportation of products. The FDA and DEA, as well as CMS (including with respect to complex Medicare reimbursement requirements applicable to our specialty home medical supplies business), have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities and, in particular, the DEA has heightened enforcement activities due to the opioid crisis in the United States. One of our businesses was recently suspended by CMS from receiving payments from Medicare, although it is permitted to continue to perform and bill for Medicare services. The amounts billed are being deposited in an escrow account pending resolution of an audit. The Company has not recognized revenue for these services and has currently deferred slightly over $4 million in revenue. Our business is also subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad.\nThe failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations, could materially adversely affect our business. The costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations, as they now exist and as they may be modified, could be material. Allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. While we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable laws and regulations, and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws, we are potentially subject to penalties, including warning letters, substantial civil and criminal penalties, mandatory recall of product, seizure of product and injunction, consent decrees and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution. If we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance, we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines and the loss of licenses. Non-compliance with government requirements could also adversely affect our ability to participate in important federal and state government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and damage our reputation.\nThe EU Medical Device Regulation may adversely affect our business.\nThe EU MDR, applicable since May 26, 2021, significantly modifies and intensifies the regulatory compliance requirements for the medical device industry as a whole. Among other things, the EU MDR:\n\u2022 strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;\n\u2022 establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers\u2019 responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;\n\u2022 improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;\n\u2022 sets up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU;\n\u2022 strengthens rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market; and\n\u2022 identifies importers and distributors and medical device products through registration in a database (EUDAMED not due until May 26, 2022 and after).\nIn particular, the EU MDR imposes stricter requirements for the confirmation that a product meets the regulatory requirements, including regarding a product\u2019s clinical evaluation and a company\u2019s quality systems, and for the distribution, marketing and sale of medical devices, including post-market surveillance. Medical devices that have been assessed and/or certified under the EU Medical Device Directive may continue to be placed on the market until 2024 (or until the expiry of their certificates, if applicable and earlier); however, requirements regarding the distribution, marketing and sale including quality systems and post-market surveillance have to be observed by manufacturers, importers and distributors as of the application date.\nThe modifications created by the EU MDR may have an impact on the way we design and manufacture products and the way we conduct our business in the European Economic Area.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud or other laws and regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nCertain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations. Some of these laws, referred to as \u201cfalse claims laws,\u201d prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs. Other laws, referred to as \u201canti-kickback laws,\u201d prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs. Certain additional state and federal laws, such\nas the federal Physician Self-Referral Law, commonly known as the \u201cStark Law,\u201d prohibit physicians and other health professionals from referring a patient to an entity with which the physician (or family member) has a financial relationship, for the furnishing of certain designated health services (for example, durable medical equipment and medical supplies), unless an exception applies. Violations of Anti-Kickback statutes or the Stark Law may be enforced as violations of the federal False Claims Act.\nThe fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to heightened enforcement activity over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of \u201crelators\u201d who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states) under applicable false claims laws, and who may receive up to 30% of total government recoveries. Penalties under fraud and abuse laws may be severe, including treble damages and substantial civil penalties under the federal False Claims Act, as well as potential loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, criminal penalties, or imposition of a corporate compliance monitor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses. Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs. Most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal False Claims Act penalties, as well as other fraud and abuse laws.\nWith respect to measures of this type, the United States government (among others) has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians, dentists and other health care providers, on the other. As a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance.\nIn the EU, the Directive No. 2019/1937 of 23 October 2019 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law, which was to be implemented by EU member states by December 17, 2021, organizes the legal protection of whistleblowers. This Directive covers whistleblowers reporting breaches of certain EU laws, in particular as regards public health, the above-mentioned Directive No. 2001/83, Regulation No. 726/2004 or, as regards data protection, the GDPR. The Directive protects a wide range of people and includes former employees. All private companies with 50 or more employees are required to create effective internal reporting channels. The implementation of this Directive by EU member states is still underway for many of them. As of mid-January 2022, only five EU Member States have fully implemented it (Denmark, Lithuania, Malta, Portugal and Sweden) while the process is ongoing in the others but with varying degrees of progress.\nWe also are subject to certain United States and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, German anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years. Our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial results, including, without limitation, securities, antitrust, consumer protection, and marketing laws and regulations.\nIn the EU, both active and passive bribery are criminalized. The EU Council Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA of 22 July 2003 on combating corruption in the private sector establishes more detailed rules on the liability of legal persons and deterrent sanctions. However, the liability of legal persons is regulated at a national level.\nFailure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and other laws and regulations, could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may determine to enter into settlements, make payments, agree to consent decrees or enter into other arrangements to resolve such matters. Intentional or unintentional failure to comply with consent decrees could materially adversely affect our business.\nWhile we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations, and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our\nservices or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the collection, storage and processing of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health records or transmissions, we could be required to make significant changes to our products, or incur substantial fines, penalties or other liabilities.\nOur businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products, and our specialty home medical supply business, include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health, clinical, financial and other sensitive information of individuals. These information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack, which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns, and could involve claims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies.\nWe are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, such as HIPAA, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the CCPA, and the CPRA that becomes effective on January 1, 2023. Laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection are continually evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. These requirements may not be harmonized, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices. Our businesses\u2019 failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation. Also, evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products to reflect these legal requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nIn addition, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU have adopted the GDPR, which increases privacy rights for individuals in the EU or EEA, or \u201cData Subjects\u201d, including individuals who are our customers, suppliers and employees. The GDPR extended the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and generally imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies, such as us, that offer goods or services to Data Subjects or monitor their behavior (including by companies based outside of Europe). Noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of EUR 20 million, or 4% of global company revenues. Data Subjects also have the right to seek compensation for damages. Member states may individually impose additional requirements and penalties regarding certain matters, such as employee personal data. With respect to the personal data it protects, the GDPR requires, among other things, company accountability, consents from Data Subjects or other acceptable legal basis to process the personal data, breach notifications within 72 hours, data integrity and security, and fairness and transparency regarding the storage, use or other processing of the personal data. The GDPR also provides rights to Data Subjects relating notably to information, access, modification, erasure and transporting of the personal data.\nOn August 20, 2021, China promulgated the PIPL, which took effect on November 1, 2021. The PIPL imposes specific rules for processing personal information and it also specifies that the law shall also apply to personal information activities carried out outside China but for the purpose of providing products or services to PRC citizens. Any non-compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to fines, orders to rectify or terminate any actions that are deemed illegal by regulatory authorities, other penalties, as well as reputational damage or legal proceedings against us, which may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The PIPL carries maximum penalties of CNY50 million or 5% of the annual revenue of entities that process personal data.\nIn the United States, the CCPA, which increases the privacy protections afforded California residents, became effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA generally requires companies, such as us, to institute additional protections regarding the collection, use and disclosure of certain personal information of California residents. Compliance with the obligations imposed by the CCPA depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. Regulations were released in August of 2020, but there remains some uncertainty about how the CCPA will be interpreted by the courts and enforced by the regulators. If we fail to comply with the CCPA or if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the CCPA, we may be subject to certain fines or other penalties and litigation,\nany of which may negatively impact our reputation, require us to expend significant resources, and harm our business. Furthermore, California voters approved the CPRA on November 3, 2020, which will amend and expand the CCPA, including by providing consumers with additional rights with respect to their personal information, and creating a new state agency to enforce CCPA and CPRA. The CPRA will come into effect on January 1, 2023, applying to information collected by businesses on or after January 1, 2022.\nOther states, as well as the federal government, have increasingly considered the adoption of similarly expansive personal privacy laws, backed by significant civil penalties for non-compliance. Virginia and Colorado were both successful in passing privacy legislation in 2021, becoming effective on January 1, 2023 and July 1, 2023 respectively. While we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the GDPR, CCPA, PIPL and CPRA requirements, our compliance with data privacy and cybersecurity laws is likely to impose additional costs on us, and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements, or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe also sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, use to store and manage patient medical or dental records. These customers and we are subject to laws, regulations and industry standards, such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require the protection of the privacy and security of those records. Our products or services may be used as part of these customers\u2019 comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable data privacy and security laws and contractual requirements. Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products or services to comply with applicable legal or contractual data privacy and security requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation.\nUnder the GDPR, health data belong to the category of \u201csensitive data\u201d and benefit from specific protections. Processing of such data is generally prohibited, except for specific exceptions.\nCertain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of EHR systems and other products linked to government supported incentive programs, where the EHR systems must be certified as having certain capabilities designated in evolving standards, such as those adopted by CMS and ONC. In order to maintain certification of our EHR products, we must satisfy the changing governmental standards. If any of our EHR systems do not meet these standards, yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments, we may be exposed to risk, such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act. While we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and that we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or resulting changes in our, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMoreover, in order to satisfy our customers and comply with evolving legal requirements, our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex functionality, such as with respect to reporting and information blocking. Although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the effort may involve increased costs, and our failure to implement product modifications, or otherwise satisfy applicable standards, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAdditionally, as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology, the ability of these connected systems to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important. As a medical device manufacturer, we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device.\nTax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments, as well as foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could materially adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be materially\nadversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives. In addition, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.\nWe face inherent risk of exposure to product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury.\nOur business involves a risk of product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims in the ordinary course of business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of products. Additionally, we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products. As a result, we could be subject to the potential risk of product liability, intellectual property infringement or other claims relating to the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities. In addition, as our private-label business continues to grow, purchasers of such products may increasingly seek recourse directly from us, rather than the ultimate product manufacturer, for product-related claims. Another potential risk we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain. In addition, some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials. The improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability or at least legal action that could harm our reputation.\nCustoms policies or legislative import restrictions could hinder the Company\u2019s ability to import goods necessary to our operations on a timely basis and result in government enforcement actions and/or sanctions\nGovernment-imposed import policies and legislation regulating the import of goods and prohibiting the use of forced labor or human trafficking could result in delays or the inability to import goods in a timely manner that are necessary to our operations, and such policies or legislation could also result in financial penalties, other sanctions, government enforcement actions and reputational harm. While the Company has policies against and seeks to avoid the import of goods that are manufactured in whole or in part by forced labor or through human trafficking, as a result of legislative and governmental policy initiatives, we may be subject to increasing potential delays, added costs, supply chain disruption and other restrictions.\nGENERAL RISKS\nSecurity risks generally associated with our information systems and our technology products and services could materially adversely affect our business, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if such products, services or systems (or third-party systems we rely on) are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, are subject to cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of time.\nWe rely on information systems (IS) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, manage and store customer, product, supplier and employee data to, among other things:\n\u2022 maintain and manage worldwide systems to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers;\n\u2022 receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;\n\u2022 manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers;\n\u2022 process payments to suppliers; and\n\u2022 provide products and services that maintain certain of our customers\u2019 electronic medical or dental records (including protected health information of their patients).\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years, and a cyberattack that bypasses our IS security systems (including third-party systems we rely on) causing an IS security breach may lead to a material disruption of our IS business systems (including third-party systems we rely on) and/or the loss of business information, as well as claims against us by affected parties and/or governmental agencies, and involve fines and penalties, costs for remediation, and substantial defense and settlement expenses. In addition, we develop products and provide services to our customers that are technology-based, and a cyberattack that bypasses the IS security systems of our\nproducts or services causing a security breach and/or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or services could also cause significant loss of business and reputational harm, and actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies. In particular, certain of our practice management products and services purchased by health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, are used to store and manage patient medical or dental records. These customers are subject to laws and regulations which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our products may be used as part of these customers\u2019 comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws. Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements, may not only cause reputational harm and loss of business, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve damages, fines and penalties, costs for remediation, and substantial defense and settlement expenses. In addition, a cyberattack on a third-party that we use to manage a portion of our information systems could result in the same effects. Additionally, legislative or regulatory action related to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement new technology products and services.\nFrom time to time, we have had to address non-material security incidents (\u201csecurity incidents\u201d). There can be no assurance that we will not experience security incidents in the future. Security incidents can be difficult to detect and any delay in identifying them could increase their harm. While we have implemented measures to protect our IS systems, such measures may not prevent these events. Any such security incidents could disrupt our operations, harm our reputation or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business. We have various insurance policies, including cybersecurity insurance, covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate. There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost to cover costs and expenses related to security incidents.\nFurthermore, procedures and safeguards must continually evolve to meet new IS challenges, and enhancing protections, and conducting investigations and remediation, may impose additional costs on us.\nFinally, our business may be interrupted by shortfalls of IS systems providers engaged by our customers, such as Internet-based services upon which our customers depend to access certain of our products.\nOur global operations are subject to inherent risks that could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur global operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business. The risks that our global operations are subject to include, among other things:\n\u2022 difficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022 difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products, establishing channels of distribution and contract manufacturing in foreign markets;\n\u2022 fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies (including, without limitation, in connection with Brexit);\n\u2022 uncertainties relating to the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement of December 2020, including for example potential implementation problems such as border delays, as well as potential changes to the U.K. regulatory scheme to replace EU requirements;\n\u2022 longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022 repatriation of cash from our foreign operations to the United States;\n\u2022 regulatory requirements, including without limitation, anti-bribery, anti-corruption and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records;\n\u2022 litigation risks, new or unanticipated litigation developments and the status of litigation matters;\n\u2022 unexpected difficulties in importing or exporting our products and import/export tariffs, quotas, sanctions or penalties;\n\u2022 limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property;\n\u2022 unexpected regulatory, legal, economic and political changes in foreign markets;\n\u2022 changes in tax regulations that influence purchases of capital equipment;\n\u2022 civil disturbances, geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war or political or military coups;\n\u2022 risks associated with climate change, including physical risks such as impacts from extreme weather events and other potential physical consequences, regulatory and technological requirements, market developments, stakeholder expectations and reputational risk; and\n\u2022 public health emergencies, including COVID-19.\nOur future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management, and our revenues and profitability depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute.\nOur future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management, particularly Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of Mr. Bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have an employment agreement with Mr. Bergman. We do not currently have \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance policies on any of our employees. Competition for senior management is intense, burnout and turn-over rates are increasing workplace concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel. Additionally, our future revenues and profitability depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers. If we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nDisruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us.", "PERMNO": 82581, "SIC": 5047, "TIC": "HSIC"}
