Other risks and uncertainties that we have not predicted or assessed may also adversely affect us.\nIf any of the negative effects associated with the following risks occur, our earnings, financial condition or business could be materially harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline, resulting in the loss of all or part of stockholders\u2019 investments.\nRisk Factors Related to Reimbursement and Government Regulation\nWe cannot predict the effect that health care reform and other changes in government programs may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe PPACA and the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cActs\u201d) were signed into law by President Obama on March 23, 2010, and March 30, 2010, respectively. The Acts dramatically alter the United States\u2019 health care system and are intended to decrease the number of uninsured Americans and reduce overall health care costs. The Acts attempt to achieve these goals by, among other things, requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance, expanding Medicare and Medicaid eligibility, reducing Medicare and Medicaid payments, and tying reimbursement to the satisfaction of certain quality criteria. The Acts also contain a number of measures that are intended to reduce fraud and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Because a majority of the measures contained in the Acts have either just recently or not yet taken effect, it is difficult to predict the impact the Acts will have on our operations. However, depending on how they are ultimately interpreted and implemented, the Acts could have an adverse effect on our business and its financial condition and results of operations.\nWe derive a majority of our consolidated net service revenue from Medicare. If there are changes in Medicare rates or methods governing Medicare payments for our services, or if we are unable to control our costs, our results of operations and cash flows could decline materially.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we received 74.5%, 75.9% and 79.8%, respectively, of our net service revenue from Medicare. Reductions in Medicare rates or changes in the way Medicare pays for services could cause our net service revenue and net income to decline, perhaps materially. See Part I, Item 1. Reimbursement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding reimbursements. Reductions in Medicare reimbursement could be caused by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nadministrative or legislative changes to the base rates under the applicable prospective payment systems;\n\u2022\nthe reduction or elimination of annual rate increases;\n\u2022\nthe imposition or increase by Medicare of mechanisms shifting more responsibility for a portion of payment to beneficiaries, such as co-payments;\n\u2022\nadjustments to the relative components of the wage index used in determining reimbursement rates;\n\u2022\nchanges to case mix or therapy thresholds;\n\u2022\nthe reclassification of home health resource groups or long-term care diagnosis-related groups; or\n\u2022\nfurther limitations on referrals to long-term acute care hospitals from host hospitals.\nWe receive fixed payments from Medicare for our services based on the level of care provided to our patients. Consequently, our profitability largely depends upon our ability to manage the cost of providing these services. Medicare currently provides for an annual adjustment of the various payment rates, such as the base episode rate for our home nursing services, based upon the increase or decrease of the medical care expenditure, which may be less than actual inflation. This adjustment could be eliminated or reduced in any given year. Also beginning on April 1, 2013 Medicare reimbursement was cut an additional 2% through sequestration as mandated by the Congressional Budget Act. Further, Medicare routinely reclassifies home health resource groups and long-term care diagnosis-related groups. As a result of those reclassifications, we could receive lower reimbursement rates depending on the case mix of the patients we service. If our cost of providing services increases by more than the annual Medicare price adjustment, or if these reclassifications result in lower reimbursement rates, our results of operations, net income and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation. Any changes in the laws and regulations governing our business, or the interpretation and enforcement of those laws or regulations, could require us to modify our operations and could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows.\nAs a provider of health care services, we are subject to extensive regulation on the federal, state and local levels, including with regard to:\n\u2022\nlicensure and certificates of need and permits of approval;\n\u2022\ncoding and billing for services;\n\u2022\nconduct of operations, including financial relationships among health care providers, Medicare fraud and abuse and physician self-referral;\n\u2022\nmaintenance and protection of records, including HIPAA;\n\u2022\nenvironmental protection, health and safety;\n\u2022\ncertification of additional agencies or facilities by the Medicare program; and\n\u2022\npayment for services.\nThe laws and regulations governing our operations, along with the terms of participation in various government programs, regulate how we do business, the services we offer and our interactions with patients and other providers. See Part I, Item 1. Government Regulations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning applicable laws and regulations. These laws and regulations, and their interpretations, are subject to frequent change. Changes in existing laws, regulations, their interpretations or the enactment of new laws or regulations could increase our costs of doing business and cause our net income to decline. If we fail to comply with these applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate and our ability to participate in federal and state reimbursement programs.\nThe PPACA also amended the False Claims Act to provide that a provider must report and return overpayments within 60 days of identifying the overpayment or the claims for the services that generated the overpayments become false claims subject to the False Claims Act. Overpayments include payments for services for which the provider does not have proper documentation. If we were to identify documentation failures that could not be corrected we could be required to return payments received for those claims within the mandated 60-day time period. If we fail to identify and return overpayments within the required 60-day period we could be subject to suits under the False Claims Act by the government or relators (whistleblowers). On February 13, 2015, CMS announced that it will delay finalizing regulations that were intended to clarify when a payment is \u201cidentified\u201d for purposes of the 60-day rule. Notwithstanding the delay, providers are still required to comply with the rule even though there is considerable uncertainty over exactly when the 60-day period begins. Due to this uncertainty, our continued compliance with the False Claims Act and its implementing regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations.\nOn October 6, 2014, CMS issued a proposed rule that would revise the Medicare and Medicaid conditions of participation for home health agencies. The proposed rule would require home health agencies to develop, implement, and maintain an agency-wide, data-driven quality assessment and improvement program and a system of communication and integration to identify patient needs and coordinate care. The proposed rule also aims to clarify and expand current patient rights requirements and contains several other clarifications and updates largely focused on creating a more patient-centered, data-driven, outcome-oriented process for patient care. If the proposed rule is finalized, we expect to face costs associated with compliance with such changes.\nOn December 11, 2014, CMS proposed a star rating methodology for home health agencies to meet the PPACA\u2019s call for more transparent, public information on provider quality. All Medicare-certified home health agencies would be eligible to receive a star rating (from one to five stars) based on a number of quality measures, such as timely initiation of care, drug education provided to patients, fall risk assessment, depression assessments, improvements in bed transferring, and bathing, among others. The \u201cQuality of Patient Care Star Ratings\u201d were first published in July, 2015, and are updated quarterly thereafter based upon new data that is published with the ratings on the \u201cHome Health Compare\u201d section of the medicare.gov website. While we are pleased with the initial ratings received by our home health agencies and are striving to improve our results, it is not clear at this time what impact, if any, the new rating system will have on our home health business.\nWe are also subject to various routine and non-routine governmental reviews, audits and investigations. These audits include those conducted through the recovery audit contractor program and the zone program integrity contractor program, in which third party firms engaged by CMS conduct extensive reviews of claims data and non-medical and other records to identify potential improper payments under the Medicare Program. In recent years, federal and state civil and criminal enforcement agencies have heightened and coordinated their oversight efforts related to the health care industry, including with respect to referral practices, cost reporting, billing practices, joint ventures and other financial relationships among health care providers. Although we have invested substantial time and effort in implementing policies and procedures to comply with laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities arising from violations. A violation of the laws governing our operations, or changes in the interpretation of those laws, could result in the imposition of fines, civil or criminal penalties, the termination of our rights to participate in federal and state-sponsored programs or the suspension or revocation of our licenses to operate. If we become subject to material fines or if other sanctions or other corrective actions are imposed upon us, we may suffer a substantial reduction in net income.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws that govern our employment practices. Failure to comply with these laws, or changes to these laws that increase our employment-related expenses, could adversely impact our operations.\nWe are required to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to employment, including occupational safety and health requirements, wage and hour requirements, employment insurance, and equal employment opportunity laws. These laws can vary significantly among states and can be highly technical. Costs and expenses related to these requirements are a significant operating expense and may increase as a result of, among other things, changes in federal or state laws or regulations requiring employers to provide specified benefits to employees, increases in the minimum wage and local living wage ordinances, increases in the level of existing benefits, or the lengthening of periods for which unemployment benefits are available. We may not be able to offset any increased costs and expenses. Furthermore, any failure to comply with these laws, including even a seemingly minor infraction, can result in significant penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, a number of states require that direct care workers receive state-mandated minimum wage and/or overtime pay. Opponents say that the new protections will make in-home care more expensive for government programs that pay for such services, and that these new rules and regulations could result in a reduction in covered services. We will continue to evaluate the effect of these various new rules and regulations on our operations.\nCurrent economic conditions and continued decline in spending by the Federal and State governments could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWorldwide economic conditions have significantly declined and will likely remain depressed for the foreseeable future. While our services are not typically sensitive to general declines in the federal and state economies, the erosion in the tax base caused by the general economic downturn has caused, and will likely continue to cause, restrictions on the federal and state governments\u2019 ability to obtain financing and a decline in spending. As a result, we may face reimbursement rate cuts or reimbursement delays from Medicare and Medicaid and other governmental payors, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nIf any of our agencies or facilities fail to comply with the conditions of participation in the Medicare program, that agency or facility could be terminated from Medicare, which could adversely affect our net service revenue and net income.\nOur agencies and facilities must comply with the extensive conditions of participation in the Medicare program. These conditions of participation vary depending on the type of agency or facility, but, in general, require our agencies and facilities to meet specified standards relating to personnel, patient rights, patient care, patient records, administrative reporting and legal compliance. If an agency or facility fails to meet any of the Medicare conditions of participation, that agency or facility may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable state surveyor. If that agency or facility then fails to institute a plan of correction to correct the deficiency within the time period provided by the state surveyor, that agency or facility could be terminated from the Medicare program. We respond in the ordinary course to deficiency notices issued by state surveyors and none of our facilities or agencies have ever been terminated from the Medicare program for failure to comply with the conditions of participation. Any termination of one or more of our agencies or facilities from the Medicare program for failure to satisfy the Medicare conditions of participation could adversely affect our net service revenue and net income.\nOur revenue may be negatively impacted by a failure to appropriately document services, resulting delays in reimbursement.\nReimbursement to us is conditioned upon providing the correct administrative and billing codes and properly documenting the services themselves, including the level of service provided, and the necessity for the services. If incorrect or incomplete documentation is provided or inaccurate reimbursement codes are utilized, this could result in nonpayment for services rendered and could lead to allegations of billing fraud. This could subsequently lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, third-party payors may disallow, in whole or in part, requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not covered, services provided were not medically necessary, or supporting documentation was not adequate. In addition, timing delays may cause working capital shortages. Working capital management, including prompt and diligent billing and collection, is an important factor in achieving our financial results and maintaining liquidity. It is possible that documentation support, system problems, provider issues or industry trends may extend our collection period, which may materially adversely affect our working capital, and our working capital management procedures may not successfully mitigate this risk.\nThe inability of our long-term acute care hospitals to maintain their certification as long-term acute care hospitals could have an adverse affect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our LTACHs fail to meet or maintain the standards for Medicare certification as LTACHs, such as for average minimum patient length-of-stay and restrictions on sources of referral (e.g. 25 Percent rule), they will receive reimbursement under the prospective payment system applicable to general acute care hospitals rather than the system applicable to long-term acute care hospitals. Payments at rates applicable to general acute care hospitals would likely result in our LTACHs receiving less Medicare reimbursement than they currently receive for their patient services. If any of our LTACHs were subject to payment as general acute care hospitals, our net service revenue and net income would decline.\nThe implementation of new patient criteria for our LTACHs under the BBA 2013 will reduce the population of patients eligible for LTACH-PPS and change the basis upon which we are paid which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nThe BBA 2013 creates new Medicare criteria and payment rules for our LTACHs. Under the new criteria, our LTACHs treating patients with at least a three-day prior stay in an acute care hospital intensive care unit and patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation admitted from an acute care hospital will continue to receive payment under LTACH-PPS rate. Other patients will continue to have access to LTACH care, but our LTACH will be paid at a \u201csite-neutral rate\u201d for these patients, based on the lesser of per diem Medicare rates paid for patients with the same diagnoses under IPPS or LTACH costs.\nThe effective date of the new patient criteria was October 1, 2015, followed by a two-year phase-in period tied to each LTACH\u2019s cost reporting period. During the phase-in period, payment for patients receiving the site-neutral rate will be based 50% on the current LTACH-PPS rate and 50% on the new site-neutral rate. For our two LTACHs that have a cost reporting period starting before July 1 of each year, the phase-in will begin on June 1, 2016. For our six LTACHs that have a cost reporting period starting on or after July 1 of each year, the phase-in will begin on September 1, 2016.\nWe continue to analyze Medicare and internal data to estimate the number of our cases that will continue to be paid under the LTACH-PPS rate. At this time, we estimate that less than one-third of our current LTACH patients will be paid at the site-neutral rate under the new criteria once it is fully phased-in. The site-neutral payment rates will be based on the lesser of per diem Medicare rates paid for patients with the same diagnoses under IPPS or our LTACHs costs. There can be no assurance that these site-neutral payments will not be materially less than the payments currently provided under LTACH-PPS rates.\nThe additional patient criteria imposed by the BBA 2013 will reduce the population of patients eligible for LTACH-PPS rates and change the basis upon which our LTACHs are paid for other patients. In addition, the BBA 2013 will generate additional governmental regulations, including interpretations and enforcement actions surrounding those regulations. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur hospice operations are subject to two annual Medicare caps. If any of our hospice providers exceeds such caps, our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOverall payments made by Medicare to each hospice provider number (generally corresponding to each of our hospice agencies) are subject to an inpatient cap amount and an overall payment cap amount, which are calculated and published by the Medicare fiscal intermediary on an annual basis covering the period from November 1 through October 31. If payments received under any of our hospice provider numbers exceeds either of these caps, we may be required to reimburse Medicare for payments received in excess of the caps, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the structures or operations of our joint ventures are found to violate the law, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nSeveral of our joint ventures are with hospitals and physicians, which are governed by the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws. These anti-kickback statutes prohibit the payment or receipt of anything of value in return for referrals of patients or services covered by governmental health care programs, such as Medicare. The OIG has published numerous safe harbors that exempt qualifying arrangements from enforcement under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. We have sought to satisfy as many safe harbor requirements as possible in structuring our joint ventures. For example, each of our equity joint ventures with hospitals and physicians is structured in accordance with the following principles:\n\u2022\nthe investment interest offered is not based upon actual or expected referrals by the hospital or physician;\n\u2022\nour joint venture partners are not required to make or influence referrals to the joint venture;\n\u2022\nat the time the joint venture is formed, each hospital or physician joint venture partner is required to make an actual capital contribution to the joint venture equal to the fair market value of his or her investment interest and is at risk to lose his or her investment;\n\u2022\nneither we nor the joint venture entity lends funds to or guarantees a loan to the hospital or physician to acquire interests in the joint venture; and\n\u2022\ndistributions to our joint venture partners are based solely on their equity interests and are not affected by referrals from the hospital or physician.\nDespite our efforts to meet the safe harbor requirements where possible, our joint ventures may not satisfy all elements of the safe harbor requirements.\nIf any of our joint ventures were found to be in violation of federal or state anti-kickback or physician referral laws, we could be required to restructure them or refuse to accept referrals from the physicians or hospitals with which we have entered into a joint venture. We also could be required to repay to Medicare amounts we have received pursuant to any prohibited referrals, and we could suffer civil or\ncriminal penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate and our ability to participate in federal and state health care programs. If any of our joint ventures were subject to any of these penalties, our business could be materially adversely affected. If the structure of any of our joint ventures were found to violate federal or state anti-kickback statutes or physician referral laws, we may be unable to implement our growth strategy, which could have an adverse impact on our future net income and consolidated results of operations.\nThe application of state certificate of need and permit of approval regulations and compliance with federal and state licensing requirements could substantially limit our ability to operate and grow our business.\nOur ability to expand operations in a state will depend on our ability to obtain a state license to operate. States may have a limit on the number of licenses they issue. For example, Louisiana currently has a moratorium on the issuance of new home nursing agency licenses. We cannot predict whether this moratorium will be extended beyond this date or whether any other states in which we operate, or may wish to operate in the future, may adopt a similar moratorium.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we operated in 12 states that require health care providers to obtain prior approval, known as a certificate of need or a permit of approval, for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities, to make certain capital expenditures or to make changes in services or bed capacity. The failure to obtain any requested certificate of need, permit of approval or other license could impair our ability to operate or expand our business.\nRisk Factors Related to Capital and Liquidity\nThe condition of the financial markets, including volatility and weakness in the equity, capital and credit markets, could limit the availability and terms of debt and equity financing sources to fund the capital and liquidity requirements of our business.\nFinancial markets experienced significant disruptions over the past few years. These disruptions have impacted liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and, in certain cases, significantly reducing the availability of certain types of debt financing. Despite the instability over the past few years within the financial markets nationally and globally, we have not experienced any individual lender limitations to extend credit under our revolving credit facility. However, the obligations of each of the lending institutions in our revolving credit facility are separate and the availability of future borrowings under our revolving credit facility could be impacted by further volatility and disruptions in the financial credit markets or other events. Our inability to access our revolving credit facility or refinance the revolving credit facility would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial positions, results of operations and liquidity.\nBased on our current plan of operations, including acquisitions, we believe our existing cash balance, when combined with expected cash flows from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to fund our growth strategy and to meet our anticipated operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. If our future net service revenue or cash flow from operations is less than we currently anticipate, we may not have sufficient funds to implement our growth strategy. Further, we cannot readily predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition and internal development efforts and the associated capital commitments. If we do not have sufficient cash resources, our growth could be limited unless we are able to obtain additional equity or debt financing.\nThe agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains, and future debt agreements may contain, various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business.\nThe agreement and instruments governing our revolving credit facility, and the agreements and instruments governing future debt agreements may contain various restrictive covenants that, among other things, require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios that may restrict our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur more debt;\n\u2022\nredeem or repurchase stock, pay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmake unapproved acquisitions;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate;\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets; and/or\n\u2022\nmake fundamental changes in our corporate existence and principal business.\nIn addition, events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with and maintain such financial tests and ratios. Any failure by us to comply with or maintain all applicable financial tests and ratios and to comply with all applicable covenants could result in an event of default with respect to our revolving credit facility or any other future debt agreements. An event of default could lead to the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding loans and the termination of the commitments to make further extensions of credit. Even if we are able to comply with all applicable covenants, the restrictions on our ability to operate our business at our sole discretion could\nharm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities.\nOur net service revenue is concentrated in a small number of states, which makes us sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in those states.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our facilities in Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, and Arkansas accounted for approximately 61.1% of our net service revenue. Accordingly, any changes in the current demographic, economic, competitive, or regulatory conditions in these states could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Medicaid changes in these states could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nHurricanes or other adverse weather events could negatively affect the local economies in which we operate or disrupt our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOur operations along coastal areas in the southern United States are particularly susceptible to hurricanes. Such weather events can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate. Future hurricanes could affect our operations or the economies in those market areas and result in damage to certain of our facilities, the equipment located at such facilities or equipment rented to patients in those areas. Our business or results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of future hurricanes. Although we maintain insurance coverage, we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover any losses or that we will be able to maintain insurance at a reasonable cost in the future. If our losses from business interruption or property damage exceed the amount for which we are insured, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe may be more vulnerable to the effects of a public health catastrophe than other businesses due to the nature of our patients.\nThe majority of our patients are older individuals and others with complex medical challenges, many of whom may be more vulnerable than the general public during a pandemic or in a public health catastrophe. Our employees are also at greater risk of contracting contagious diseases due to their increased exposure to vulnerable patients. For example, if a flu pandemic were to occur, we could suffer significant losses to our consumer population or a reduction in the availability of our employees and, at a high cost, be required to hire replacements for affected workers. Accordingly, certain public health catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDelays in reimbursement may cause liquidity problems.\nOur business is characterized by delays in reimbursement from the time we request payment for our services to the time we receive reimbursement or payment. A portion of our estimated reimbursement (60% for an initial episode of care and 50% for subsequent episodes of care) for each Medicare episode is billed at the commencement of the episode and we typically receive payment within approximately seven days. The remaining reimbursement is billed upon completion of the episode and is typically paid within 14 to 17 days from the billing date. If we have information system problems or issues arise with Medicare or other payors, we may encounter further delays in our payment cycle. For example, in the past we have experienced delays resulting from problems arising out of the implementation by Medicare of new or modified reimbursement methodologies or as a result of natural disasters, such as hurricanes. We have also experienced delays in reimbursement resulting from our implementation of new information systems related to our accounts receivable and billing functions. Any future timing delay may cause working capital shortages. As a result, working capital management, including prompt and diligent billing and collection, is an important factor in our consolidated results of operations and liquidity. Our working capital management procedures may not successfully negate this risk. Significant delays in payment or reimbursement could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition.\nRisk Factors Related to Operations and our Growth Strategy\nWe could be required to record a material non-cash charge to income if our recorded goodwill or intangible assets are impaired.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of the assets on our balance sheet and are assessed for impairment annually or whenever circumstances indicate potential impairment. The goodwill assessment includes comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the assets assigned to the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit were to exceed our estimate of fair value of the reporting unit, we would be required to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities within the reporting unit to ascertain the fair value of goodwill. If we determine that the fair value is less than our book value, we could be required to record a non-cash impairment charge to our consolidated statements of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, debt covenants and ability to access capital.\nWe assess other intangible assets, such as trade names and licenses, individually, based on expected revenue and cash flows to be generated by those assets. Specific economic factors and conditions attributed to local agencies could cause these expected revenue and cash flows to decrease. If we determine that the fair value is less than the carrying value, we could be required to record material non-cash impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, debt covenants and ability to access capital.\nOur allowance for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts may not be sufficient to cover uncollectible amounts.\nOn an ongoing basis, we estimate the amount of Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance receivables that we will not be able to collect. This allows us to calculate the expected loss on our receivables for the period we are reporting. Our allowance for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts may underestimate actual uncollectible receivables for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\nadverse changes in our estimates as a result of changes in payor mix and related collection rates;\n\u2022\ninability to collect funds due to missed filing deadlines or inability to prove that timely filings were made;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in the economy generally exceeding our expectations; or\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies.\nIf our allowance for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts is insufficient to cover losses on our receivables, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in the case mix of patients, as well as payor mix and payment methodologies, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe sources and amounts of our patient revenue are determined by a number of factors, including the mix of patients and the rates of reimbursement among payors. Generally, we receive higher reimbursement for services rendered under Medicare. Changes in the case mix of the patients, payment methodologies or payor mix among private pay, Medicare and Medicaid may significantly affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nShortages in qualified nurses and other health care professionals could increase our operating costs significantly or constrain our ability to grow.\nWe rely on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and other health care professionals. The availability of qualified nurses nationwide has declined in recent years and competition for these and other health care professionals has increased and, therefore, salary and benefit costs have risen accordingly. Our ability to attract and retain nurses and other health care professionals depends on several factors, including our ability to provide desirable assignments and competitive benefits and salaries. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified nurses or other health care professionals in the future. In addition, the cost of attracting and retaining these professionals and providing them with attractive benefit packages may be higher than anticipated which could cause our net income to decline. Moreover, if we are unable to attract and retain qualified professionals, the quality of services offered to our patients may decline or our ability to grow may be constrained.\nIf we are required to either repurchase or sell a substantial portion of the equity interests in our joint ventures, our capital resources and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted.\nUpon the occurrence of fundamental changes to the laws and regulations applicable to our joint ventures, or if a substantial number of our joint venture partners were to exercise the buy/sell provisions contained in many of our joint venture agreements, we may be obligated to purchase or sell the equity interests held by us or our joint venture partners. In some instances, the purchase price under these buy/sell provisions is based on a multiple of the historical or future earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization of the equity joint venture at the time the buy/sell option is exercised. In other instances, the buy/sell purchase price will be negotiated by the partners but will be subject to a fair market valuation process. In the event the buy/sell provisions are exercised and we lack sufficient capital to purchase the interest of our joint venture partners, we may be obligated to sell our equity interest in these joint ventures. If we are forced to sell our equity interest, we will lose the benefit of those particular joint venture operations. If these buy/sell provisions are exercised and we choose to purchase the interest of our joint venture partners, we may be obligated to expend significant capital in order to complete such acquisitions. If either of these events occurs, our net service revenue and net income could decline or we may not have sufficient capital necessary to implement our growth strategy.\nIf we are unable to maintain relationships with existing referral sources or establish new referral sources, our growth and net income could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends significantly on referrals from physicians, hospitals and other health care providers in the communities in which we deliver our services. Our referral sources are not obligated to refer business to us and may refer business to other health care providers. We believe many of our referral sources refer business to us as a result of the quality of patient care provided by our local employees in the communities in which our agencies and facilities are located. If we are unable to retain these employees, our referral sources may refer business to other health care providers. Our loss of, or failure to maintain, existing relationships or our failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect our ability to expand our operations and operate profitably.\nWe face competition, including from competitors with greater resources, which may make it difficult for us to compete effectively as a provider of post-acute health care services.\nWe compete with local and regional home nursing and hospice companies, hospitals and other businesses that provide post-acute health care services, some of which are large, established companies that have significantly greater resources than we do. Our primary competition comes from local operators in each of our markets. We expect our competitors to develop joint ventures with providers, referral sources and payors, which could result in increased competition. The introduction by our competitors of new and enhanced service offerings, in combination with industry consolidation and the development of competitive joint ventures, could cause a decline in net service revenue and loss of market acceptance of our services. Future increases in competition from existing competitors or new entrants may limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and competitive pressures may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may close additional underperforming agencies in the future.\nWe regularly review the performance of our various agencies. Our review considers the current financial performance, market penetration, forecasted market growth and current and future reimbursement payment forecasts. During 2015, we incurred exit activity costs of $1.8 million in connection with the closure of certain underperforming agencies, including lease termination payments, relocation costs, severance costs and asset and intangible write-offs.\nWe will continue to monitor the performance of our agencies on an ongoing basis, and additional closures may from time to time occur in the future. If we take any further action to close agencies, we will incur additional costs and expenses, which may require us to record significant charges in future periods. While any such closures would be made in connection with our constant efforts to improve our profitability, associated charges would have a negative impact on our revenue and possibly our operating results during the short-term.\nFuture acquisitions may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities. Further, our acquisition and internal development activity may impose strains on our existing resources.\nOur growth strategy involves the acquisition of home nursing agencies and facilities throughout the United States. These acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including difficulties integrating acquired personnel and other corporate cultures into our business, the potential loss of key employees or patients of acquired agencies and the assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired agencies. We may not be able to fully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with our current business structure in an efficient and cost-effective manner. The failure to effectively integrate any of these businesses could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe generally structure our acquisitions as asset purchase transactions in which we expressly state that we are not assuming any pre-existing liabilities of the seller and obtain indemnification rights from the previous owners for acts or omissions arising prior to the date of such acquisitions. However, the allocation of liability arising from such acts or omissions between the parties could involve the expenditure of a significant amount of time, manpower and capital. Further, the former owners of the agencies and facilities we acquire may not have the financial resources necessary to satisfy our indemnification claims relating to pre-existing liabilities. If we were unsuccessful in a claim for indemnification from a seller, the liability imposed could materially adversely affect our operations.\nIn addition, as we continue to expand our markets, our growth could strain our resources, including management, information and accounting systems, regulatory compliance, logistics and other internal controls. Our resources may not keep pace with our anticipated growth. If we do not manage our expected growth effectively, our future prospects could be affected adversely.\nWe may face increased competition for attractive acquisition and joint venture candidates.\nWe intend to continue growing through the acquisition of additional home-based agencies and the formation of joint ventures with hospitals for the operation of home-based agencies. We face competition for acquisition and joint venture candidates, which may limit the number of acquisition and joint venture opportunities available to us or lead to the payment of higher prices for our acquisitions and joint ventures. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition or joint venture opportunities in the future or that any such opportunities, if identified, will be consummated on favorable terms, if at all. Without successful acquisitions or joint ventures, our future growth rate could decline. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any future acquisitions or joint ventures, if consummated, will result in further growth.\nFederal regulation may impair our ability to consummate acquisitions or open new agencies.\nChanges in federal laws or regulations may materially adversely impact our ability to acquire home nursing agencies or open new start-up home nursing agencies. For example, CMS has adopted a regulation known as the \u201c36 Month Rule\u201d that is applicable to home health agency acquisitions. Subject to certain exceptions, the 36 Month Rule prohibits buyers of certain home health agencies - those that either enrolled in Medicare or underwent a change in ownership fewer than 36 months prior to the acquisitions - from assuming the Medicare billing privileges of the acquired agency. Instead, the acquired home health agencies must enroll as new providers with Medicare. As a result, the 36 Month Rule may further increase competition for acquisition targets that are not subject to the rule, and may cause significant Medicare billing delays for the purchases of home health agencies that are subject to the rule.\nWe are subject to a corporate integrity agreement and could be subject to substantial monetary penalties or suspension of participation in federal health care programs for noncompliance.\nOn September 29, 2011, we entered into a corporate integrity agreement (\u201cCIA\u201d) with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. The CIA imposes certain auditing, self-reporting and training requirements that we must comply with. Failure to comply with certain obligations may lead to the imposition of monetary penalties and/or exclusion from participation in the federal health care programs. The imposition of monetary penalties would adversely affect our profitability. An exclusion from participation in the federal health care programs would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition as a substantial portion of our net service revenue is attributable to payments received under the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nIf we are subject to substantial malpractice or other similar claims, it could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe services we offer have an inherent risk of professional liability and substantial damage awards. We, and the nurses and other health care professionals who provide services on our behalf, may be the subject of medical malpractice claims. These nurses and other health care professionals could be considered our agents and, as a result, we could be held liable for their medical negligence. We cannot predict the effect that any claims of this nature, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have on our business or reputation or on our ability to attract and retain patients and employees. We maintain malpractice liability insurance that provides primary coverage on a claims-made basis of $1.0 million per incident and $3.0 million in annual aggregate amounts. In addition, we maintain multiple layers of umbrella coverage in the aggregate amount of $40.0 million that provide excess coverage for professional malpractice and other liabilities. We are responsible for deductibles and amounts in excess of the limits of our coverage. Claims that could be made in the future in excess of the limits of such insurance, if successful, could materially adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, our insurance coverage may not continue to be available to us at commercially reasonable rates, in adequate amounts or on satisfactory terms.\nFailure of, or problems with, our critical software or information systems could harm our business and operating results.\nWe depend upon reliable and secure information systems to provide valuable tools by which we manage our business, comply with legal requirements and provide services. In addition to our Service Value Point system, our business is also substantially dependent on non-proprietary software. We utilize a third-party software information system for billing and maintaining patient claim receivables for our LTACHs. Our systems require constant maintenance and upgrading to preserve and enhance system capabilities and security. Problems with, or the failure of, our information systems or software could negatively impact our clinical performance and our management and reporting capabilities. Any significant problems with or failures of our information systems or software could materially and adversely affect our operations and reputation, result in significant costs to us, cause delays in our ability to bill Medicare or other payors for our services, or impair our ability to provide our services in the future. The costs incurred in correcting any errors or problems with our proprietary and non-proprietary software may be substantial and could adversely affect our net income. Our agencies also depend upon our information systems for accounting, billing, collections, risk management, quality assurance, payroll, education tracking and operational performance. If we experience a reduction in the performance, reliability, availability or accuracy of our information systems, our operations and financial performance, and ability to report timely and accurate information, could be adversely affected.\nOperations that we acquire must be integrated into our various information systems in an efficient and effective manner. For certain aspects, we rely upon third party contractors to assist us with those activities. If we are unable to integrate and transition any acquired business into our information systems, due to our failures or any failure of our third party contractors, we could incur unanticipated expenses, suffer disruptions in service, experience regulatory issues and lose revenue from the operation of such business.\nOur information systems are networked via public network infrastructure and standards based encryption tools that meet regulatory requirements for transmission of protected health information over such networks. We have installed privacy protection systems on our network and point-of-care devices to prevent unauthorized access to proprietary, sensitive and legally protected information. However, threats from computer viruses, instability of the public network on which our data transit relies, or other instances that might render those networks unstable or disabled would create operational difficulties for us, including difficulties effectively transmitting claims and maintaining efficient clinical oversight of our patients, as well as disrupting revenue reporting and billing and collections management, which could adversely affect our business or operations. If personal or protected information of our patients, employees or others with whom we do business is tampered with, stolen or otherwise improperly accessed, we may incur additional fines and penalties associated with the breach of security or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident, including under HIPAA or other judicial acts, as applicable.\nOur information systems are also subject to damage or service interruption due to natural disasters, floods, fires, loss of power, loss of telecommunications connectivity, and other events that may be beyond our immediate control. While we maintain and test various disaster recovery plans and procedures, our failure to successfully implement and execute upon such plans and procedures, and restore the full operational capabilities of our information systems and software in an effective and efficient manner, could have a material adverse effect on the functionality of our information systems and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and cause a possible significant disruption of our operations and services.\nOur inability to effectively and timely transition to the new ICD-10 coding system could disrupt our operations.\nCMS has mandated that all providers implement the use of new patient codes for medical coding, referred to as ICD-10 codes, on or before October 1, 2015. This mandate substantially increased the number of medical billing codes by which we will seek reimbursement, increasing the complexity of submitting claims for reimbursement. Claims that we submit to CMS after October 1, 2015 must use ICD-10 codes or such claims will not be paid. Transition to the new ICD-10 system required alterations to our clinical software systems, as well as training of our staff involved in the coding and billing processes. In addition to these upfront costs of transition to ICD-10, it is possible that we could experience disruption or delays in payment due to implementation issues, including software errors, coding errors or a decrease in the productivity of our staff involved in coding and billing processes. Any such delays in payment could disrupt our operations and materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur failure to negotiate favorable managed care contracts, or our loss of existing favorable managed care contracts, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOne of our strategies is to diversify our payor sources by increasing the business we do with managed care companies, and we strive to secure favorable contracts with managed care payors. However, we may not be successful in these efforts. Additionally, there is a risk that any favorable managed care contracts that we can secure may be terminated on short notice, since managed care contracts typically permit the payor to terminate without cause, typically on 60 days notice. Such provisions can provide payors with leverage to reduce volume or obtain favorable pricing. Our failure to negotiate, secure and maintain favorable managed care contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisk Factors Related to our Ownership and Management\nStart-up home nursing agencies can be delayed from opening in a timely manner due to processing or regulatory approvals.\nThere can be delays associated with opening a de novo home nursing agency. These delays are the result of processing delays with the state regulatory bodies as well as processing delays by the associated fiscal intermediaries that serve as billing liaisons between the home nursing agency and CMS. To initiate operations at a de novo home nursing agency, we must submit the necessary applications along with the required documentation to the appropriate state and federal regulatory bodies. However, CMS has issued a memorandum which prioritizes the initial surveys for new Medicare providers as lowest priority for the state regulatory bodies. Moreover, depending on state requirements, the fiscal intermediary may need to receive the state license before the approval process can move forward. Once the necessary application and documentation has been submitted to the state and federal regulatory bodies, there is a testing period of transmitting data from the applicant to CMS. Once complete, the home nursing agency receives a provider agreement and corresponding number and can begin billing. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for our de novo home nursing agencies in a timely manner, such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a holding company, we have no material assets or operations of our own.\nWe are a holding company, whereby our material assets and operations are held by our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to service our debt, if any, is dependent upon the earnings from the business conducted by our subsidiaries. The distributions of those earnings or advances or other distributions of funds by these subsidiaries to us are contingent upon the subsidiaries\u2019 earnings and are subject to various business considerations. In addition, distributions by subsidiaries could be subject to statutory restrictions, including state laws requiring that the subsidiary be solvent, or contractual restrictions. If our subsidiaries are unable to make sufficient distributions or advances to us, we may not have the cash resources necessary to service our debt.\nThe loss of certain executive management or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\nOur success depends upon the continued employment of our executive management team and key employees and our ability to retain and motivate these individuals. If we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, we may not be able to successfully manage our business, achieve our business goals or replace them with equally qualified personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\nOur executive officers and directors and their affiliates hold a substantial portion of our outstanding shares of common stock and could exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, regardless of the wishes of other stockholders.\nOur executive officers and directors and individuals or entities affiliated with them, beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 18.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2015. The interests of these stockholders may differ from other stockholders\u2019 interests. If they were to act together, these affiliated stockholders would be able to significantly influence all matters that our stockholders vote upon, including the election of directors, business combinations, the amendment of our certificate of incorporation and other significant corporate actions.\nCertain provisions of our charter, bylaws, and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company.\nDelaware law and our governing documents contain provisions that may enable our Board of Directors to resist a change in control of the Company. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na staggered Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe authorization of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures required for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the Company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors or cause us to take other corporate actions.\nWe have implemented other anti-takeover provisions or provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect. These provisions and others that our Board of Directors may adopt hereafter, may discourage offers to acquire us and may permit our Board of Directors to choose not to entertain offers to purchase us, even if such offers include a substantial premium to the market price of our common stock. Therefore, our stockholders may be deprived of opportunities to profit from a sale of control.\nOur common stock is traded infrequently, which may cause volatility in our stock price, including a decline in value.\nWe have a relatively low volume of daily trades in our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d). For example, the average daily trading volume of our common stock on NASDAQ over the three-month trading period ending February 25, 2016 was approximately 123,812 shares per day. Because our common stock is traded infrequently, the price per share of our common stock can fluctuate more significantly from day-to-day than a widely held stock that is actively traded on a daily basis. For example, trading of a large volume of our common stock may have a significant impact on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, future issuances of our common stock, including the exercise of any options or the vesting of any restricted stock that we may grant to directors, executive officers and other employees in the future and the issuance of our common stock in connection with acquisitions, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend solely on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not pay dividends on our shares of common stock and intend to retain all future earnings to finance the continued growth and development of our business and for general corporate purposes. In addition, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, capital requirements, credit facility limitations, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.\nIf we identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, our business and our stock price could be adversely affected.\nWe are required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. Under Section 404, we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and report our conclusion in our Annual Report. Our independent registered public accounting firm is also required to report its conclusion regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The existence of one or more material weaknesses could require us and our auditor to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. If material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our financial reporting, which could have an adverse effect on our business and price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90734, "SIC": 8082, "TIC": "LHCG"}
