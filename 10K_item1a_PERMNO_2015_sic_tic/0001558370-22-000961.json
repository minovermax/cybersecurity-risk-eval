{"cik": "820313", "company": "AMPHENOL CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s business, operations, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and stock price can be negatively affected by many risk factors. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information in this Annual Report. The Company\u2019s past financial performance, including historical trends, should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that we currently consider immaterial may materialize and impair the Company\u2019s business, operations, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and/or stock price. In addition to the risk factor included below related to adverse public health developments and, in particular, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on public health and the global economy, the Company also notes that the effects of the pandemic have and may continue to exacerbate the risks detailed in many of the other risk factors described below.\nIf actions taken by management to limit, monitor or control enterprise risk exposures are not successful, the Company\u2019s business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and debt securities could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks related to our global operations\nThe Company is exposed to political, economic, military and other risks related to operating in countries outside the United States, and changes in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global, regional and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions. During 2021, non-U.S. markets constituted approximately 71% of the Company\u2019s net sales, with China constituting approximately 28% of the Company\u2019s net sales. The Company employs approximately 90% of its workforce outside the United States. The Company\u2019s customers are located throughout the world and the Company has many manufacturing, administrative and sales facilities outside the United States.\nIn recent years, the U.S. government has enacted new laws and taken actions that directly affect our business in China. For example, during the last few years, the U.S. Department of Commerce has added a number of Chinese-based companies to its \u201cEntity List\u201d, including existing customers of the Company. More recently, the U.S. government enacted the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which bars the importation into the United States of products made from forced labor in the Xinjiang region of China. The Chinese government could also enact laws and take actions that affect our business in China. We cannot predict what additional laws or actions may be taken by the U.S. or Chinese governments, but any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition to the new laws outlined above, during the last few years there have also been significant changes to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including, but not limited to, trade policies and tariffs affecting China. These changes have, in certain cases, increased our costs of doing business. The imposition of additional tariffs or other trade barriers could increase our costs in certain markets, and may cause our customers to find alternative sourcing or could make it more difficult for us to sell our products in some markets. Other countries where we operate or sell our products have changed, and may continue to change, their own policies on trade as well as business and foreign investment in their respective countries. Additionally, it is possible that U.S. policy changes and uncertainty about such changes could increase market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations. As a result of these dynamics, we cannot predict the impact to our business of any future changes to the U.S.\u2019s or other countries\u2019 trading relationships or the impact of new laws or regulations adopted by the U.S. or other countries.\nIn addition to the risks noted above, a number of other legal, economic and geopolitical factors both in the United States and abroad could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and/or results of operations, such as:\n\u25cf a global or regional economic slowdown in any of the Company\u2019s market segments;\n\u25cf postponement of customer spending, in response to tighter credit, financial market volatility and other global economic factors;\n\u25cf effects of significant changes in economic, monetary and/or fiscal policies in the United States and/or abroad including significant income tax changes, currency fluctuations and inflationary pressures;\n\u25cf intergovernmental conflicts or actions, including but not limited to armed conflict, trade wars, cyberattacks and acts of terrorism or war;\n\u25cf employment regulations and local labor conditions, including increases in employment costs, particularly in low-cost regions in which the Company currently operates;\n\u25cf industrial policies in various countries that favor domestic industries over multinationals or that restrict foreign companies altogether;\n\u25cf difficulties protecting intellectual property;\n\u25cf longer payment cycles;\n\u25cf changes in exchange control regulations, including any government actions that prohibit, limit or increase the cost of paying a dividend or otherwise moving cash between the Company\u2019s subsidiaries located in different countries;\n\u25cf credit risks and other challenges in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf changes in assumptions, such as discount rates, along with lower than expected investment returns and performance related to the Company\u2019s benefit plans; and\n\u25cf the impact of each of the foregoing on outsourcing and procurement arrangements.\nWe face significant risks related to adverse public health developments, including epidemics and pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAny outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our offices and manufacturing facilities throughout the world, as well as the facilities of our suppliers, customers and our customers\u2019 contract manufacturers. The COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread disruptions to our Company during the first half of 2020, and to a lesser extent, those disruptions continued during the second half of 2020 and throughout all of 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we continue to experience some disruptions, and at a minimum, particularly given the surge of cases resulting from the Omicron variant, we expect those disruptions to continue into 2022 and potentially beyond. These disruptions have included and may continue to include government regulations that inhibit our ability to operate certain of our facilities in the ordinary course, travel restrictions, supplier constraints, supply-chain interruptions, logistics challenges and limitations, labor disruptions and reduced demand from certain customers. During 2021 and into 2022, there have been resurgences in COVID-19 cases in several regions around the world, particularly related to new variant strains, including Delta and Omicron. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business and financial results going forward will be dependent on future developments such as the length and severity of the crisis, the impact of the recent resurgence of the crisis due to the Omicron variant, as well as any additional future resurgences from known or new variants, future government regulations and actions in response to the crisis, the timing, availability, effectiveness and adoption rates of vaccines and treatments, and the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and capital markets, among many other factors, all of which remain highly uncertain and unpredictable. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the health of our management team and other employees. Given these uncertainties, we expect the pandemic to continue to have an impact on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations in 2022 and potentially beyond. There can be no assurance that the COVID-19 pandemic will not have a material and adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations in the future.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has and continues to increase the likelihood and potential severity of other risks (some discussed separately within this Item 1A. Risk Factors), including but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf Increased consumer demand, product shortages and supply chain and logistics challenges have caused, and may continue to result in, significant inflationary pressures that have and may continue to increase the Company\u2019s costs of doing business.\n\u25cf Our efforts to comply with any legally required vaccine mandates amongst some or all of our employees, could lead to increased labor attrition, along with potential difficulties in attracting and recruiting personnel, which could have a negative impact on our business and operations. In addition, employees in certain geographies could choose to take legal action against the Company if we institute vaccine mandates.\n\u25cf A scarcity of resources or other hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may result in increased nationalism, protectionism and political tensions which may cause governments and/or other entities to take actions that may have a significant negative impact on the ability of the Company, its suppliers and its customers to conduct business.\n\u25cf Certain subsets of our employee population continue to work in a \u201chybrid\u201d or remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This change may exacerbate certain risks to our business, including an increased demand for information technology resources, an increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks, and an increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information.\n\u25cf Travel restrictions to certain countries, especially China, have limited our executive management\u2019s ability to visit certain operations during the last two years and such restrictions could remain in place for all of 2022 and beyond.\n\u25cf If the financial performance of our businesses were to decline significantly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we could incur a material non-cash charge to our income statement for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\u25cf If there is a general market downturn and continued high degree of volatility in the financial markets, we may experience a material re-valuation of, for example, our pension assets and obligations.\nThe Company and certain of its suppliers and customers are experiencing difficulties obtaining certain raw materials and components, and the cost of most of the Company\u2019s raw materials and components is increasing.\nThe Company uses basic materials like aluminum, steel, copper, titanium, metal alloys, gold, silver, palladium and plastic resins in its manufacturing processes as well as a variety of components and relies on third-party suppliers to secure these materials and components. The COVID-19 pandemic initially disrupted the supply of such raw materials and components, primarily in the first half of 2020. However, more recently, in 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, we, along with many of our suppliers and customers, have experienced widespread supply chain disruptions that have resulted in significant cost increases across certain raw materials and components as well as some supply shortages, that collectively have had an adverse impact on our business and operating results. For example, the recent market shortage of semiconductors has caused disruptions, from both a supply and pricing standpoint, in some of the markets we serve, in particular, the automotive market. Recent inflationary pressures have been exacerbated by the lower availability of, and increased prices for, freight and logistics, including air, sea and ground freight. In addition, the Company may not be able to pass along increased raw material or component prices to its customers. While the Company has taken and continues to take measures to procure and obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials and components at acceptable prices from our suppliers, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to do so. Accordingly, any future delays, disruptions, and supply and pricing risks, such as the ongoing supply chain challenges and disruptions that we expect to continue during 2022, could affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn limited instances we depend on a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be served by a limited number of suppliers. Delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers, and any delay could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers. The cost and availability of raw materials may fluctuate significantly due to external factors including, but not limited to, product scarcity, disruptions caused by climate change and adverse weather conditions, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, governmental policies and regulations such as trade tariffs, as well as pandemics and epidemics (such as, but not limited to, the COVID-19 pandemic), which may, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may be negatively impacted by extreme weather conditions and natural catastrophic events, including those caused by climate change and global warming.\nFrom time to time, extreme weather conditions and natural disasters have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our operations, as well as the operations of our suppliers, vendors, customers and distributors. Such extreme weather conditions and natural disasters including, but not limited to, earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, and stronger and longer-lasting weather patterns, and their consequences and effects have, in the past, temporarily disrupted our business operations both in the United States and abroad. These events could cause some of the Company\u2019s operations to suffer from supply chain disruptions and potential delays in fulfilling customer orders or order cancellations altogether, lost future business and sales, and/or damage to our property or harm to our people, each and all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international operations require us to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions and our business reputation and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, customers, suppliers, distributors or any other business partners.\nDoing business on a worldwide basis requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions, and our failure to comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to significant liabilities. These laws and regulations may apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees, subcontractors and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In particular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (\u201cFCPA\u201d). As part of our business, we deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA. In addition, some of the foreign locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption. As a result of the above activities, we are exposed to the risk of violating U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws.\nWe have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that these policies will be effective in preventing our directors, officers, employees, subcontractors and agents from taking actions that violate these legal requirements. Violations of these legal requirements could subject us to criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts and other remedial measures. In addition, any actual or alleged violations could disrupt our operations, cause reputational harm, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s results have at times been negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies, including possible foreign currency restrictions and/or devaluations. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company\u2019s sales, operating margins and equity. The Company manages currency exposure risk in a number of ways, including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold (thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency), cost reduction and pricing actions, working capital management and hedging contracts. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the Company\u2019s worldwide operations, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent on attracting, recruiting, hiring and retaining skilled employees, including as part of our various management teams.\nOur performance is dependent on our ability to attract, recruit, hire and retain skilled personnel, including our executive and management teams. Given the current inflationary wage environment and strong demand for skilled labor in many of the countries and regions in which we operate, the ability to identify and attract new talent, as well as retain existing talent, may prove to be difficult. It is possible that the current labor market could have an adverse effect on our ability to attract, recruit, hire and retain skilled employees, which in turn, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many workers around the world have re-assessed their career plans and priorities, which could lead to increased difficulty of the Company in retaining its experienced team members.\nRisks related to our end markets\nThe Company is dependent on the communications industry, including information technology and data communications, wireless communications and broadband communications.\nApproximately 42% of the Company\u2019s 2021 net sales came from sales to the communications industry, including information technology and data communication, wireless communications and broadband communications, with 12% of the Company\u2019s 2021 net sales coming from sales to the mobile devices market. Demand for these products is subject\nto rapid technological change. In addition, these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant pressure on their suppliers, including the Company. Furthermore, a trend among customers has been to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical, quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to meet these standards or maintain competitive pricing and therefore continue to compete successfully in the communications industry. The Company\u2019s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nApproximately 4% and 5% of the Company\u2019s 2021 net sales came from sales to the broadband communications and mobile networks markets, respectively. Demand for the Company\u2019s products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their systems. The amount of this capital spending and, therefore, the Company\u2019s sales and profitability could be affected by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, consolidation within the communications industry, the financial condition of operators and their access to financing, competition, technological developments, new legislation and regulation of operators. There can be no assurance that existing levels of capital spending will continue or that spending will not decrease.\nChanges in defense expenditures may reduce the Company\u2019s sales.\nApproximately 11% of the Company\u2019s 2021 net sales came from sales to the military market. The Company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs. The Company\u2019s military sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the U.S. or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the U.S. and foreign governments. A significant decline in U.S. or foreign government defense expenditures could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. U.S. and foreign government expenditures are also subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints, which may result in significant unexpected changes in levels of demand for our products.\nThe Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of our business.\nThe Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality and performance, price, customer service and delivery time. Competitors include large, diversified companies, some of which have greater assets and financial resources than the Company, as well as medium- to small-sized companies. In addition, rapid technological changes occurring in the communications industry could also lead to the entry of new competitors of all sizes against whom we may not be able to successfully compete. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition, and the inability to do so may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to acquisitions\nThe Company has at times experienced difficulties and unanticipated expenses in connection with purchasing and integrating newly acquired businesses.\nThe Company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years, including seven in 2021. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of its growth strategy. From time to time, the Company experiences difficulty and unanticipated expenses associated with purchasing and integrating acquisitions, and acquisitions do not always perform and deliver the financial benefits expected. The Company has also experienced challenges at times following the acquisition of a new company or business, including but not limited to: managing the operations, manufacturing facilities and technology; maintaining and increasing the customer base; or retaining key employees, suppliers and distributors. In certain limited cases, the Company has pursued indemnification claims against the seller or sellers of an acquired business for pre-acquisition liabilities, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants or for other reasons provided for in the relevant acquisition agreement. To the extent we pursue indemnification claims against the seller or sellers of any acquired business, such seller or sellers may successfully contest such claims, such seller or sellers may not have the financial capacity to compensate us for such claims or such claims may otherwise be difficult or impractical to enforce. We cannot predict or guarantee whether and to what extent anticipated cost savings, benefits and growth prospects will be achieved from recent or future acquisitions.\nThe Company may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges.\nOn December 31, 2021, the total assets of the Company were $14.7 billion, which included $6.4 billion of goodwill (the excess of fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of net identifiable assets of businesses acquired) and $756.9 million of other intangible assets, net. The Company performs annual evaluations (or more frequently, if necessary) for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Such evaluations to date have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment. However, if the financial performance of the Company\u2019s businesses were to decline significantly, the Company could incur a material non-cash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur, especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe, or if acquisitions and investments made by the Company fail to achieve expected returns.\nRisks related to our liquidity and capital resources\nThe Company\u2019s credit agreement contains certain covenants, which if breached, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe second amended and restated credit agreement that governs our $2.5 billion unsecured credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d), which also backstops the Company\u2019s U.S. commercial paper program (\u201cU.S. Commercial Paper Program\u201d) and Euro commercial paper program (\u201cEuro Commercial Paper Program\u201d), contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a limit on priority indebtedness and limits on incurrence of liens. Although the Company believes none of these covenants is presently restrictive to the Company\u2019s operations, the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the Company\u2019s control, and the Company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Revolving Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit and elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable which could result in the acceleration of certain of the Company\u2019s other indebtedness and the Company not having sufficient assets to repay the Revolving Credit Facility and such other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $795.2 million of outstanding borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, and no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and Euro Commercial Paper Program.\nThe Company relies on the global capital markets, and an inability to access those markets on favorable terms could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results.\nThe Company has used the global capital markets to invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions. If general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly, it could impact the Company\u2019s ability to access the capital markets. The capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in the past. Market conditions could make it more difficult to access capital to finance capital investments, acquisitions and other initiatives including dividends and share repurchases. As such, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, if the credit rating agencies that rate the Company\u2019s debt were to downgrade the Company\u2019s credit rating, it would likely increase the Company\u2019s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the Company to obtain new financing and access capital markets, which could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates.\nThe Company may be subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. The Company monitors its mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, as well as its mix of short-term and long-term debt. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $804 million, or 17%, of the Company\u2019s outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates and were primarily comprised of borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program. A 10% change in floating interest rates at December 31, 2021 would not have a material effect on the Company\u2019s interest expense. However, there can be no assurance that interest rates will not change more significantly.\nLegal and regulatory risks\nCybersecurity incidents affecting our information technology systems could disrupt business operations or cause the release of highly sensitive confidential information, resulting in adverse impacts to our reputation and operating results and potentially leading to litigation and/or governmental investigations.\nCybersecurity threats, including but not limited to malware, phishing, credential harvesting, ransomware and other increasingly sophisticated attacks, continue to expand and evolve globally, making it difficult to detect and prevent such threats from impacting the Company. Globally, there has been an increased volume of cyber threats and ransomware attempts throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Ransomware attacks have become easier to execute, and the rise of cryptocurrency has facilitated payments to criminals, making ransomware a more lucrative business. While the Company has been a target of various cybersecurity attacks, including but not limited to ransomware attacks, the impact of such attacks has not been material. Future cybersecurity incidents could lead to unauthorized access to and potentially impair the Company\u2019s information technology systems, products, customers, suppliers and third-party service providers. Cybersecurity incidents could potentially result in the disruption of our business operations and/or misappropriation, destruction or corruption of critical data and confidential or proprietary information. Cybersecurity events could also result in the loss of or inability to access confidential information and critical business, financial or other data, and/or cause the release of highly sensitive confidential information. Cybersecurity incidents could also result from unauthorized parties gaining access to our systems or information through fraudulent or other means of deceiving our employees, suppliers or third-party service providers. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may increase our susceptibility to cybersecurity incidents and risks, especially as some of our employees have transitioned and continue to work from home. Despite the Company\u2019s implementation of preventative security measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats, our infrastructure may still be susceptible to disruptions from cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, security breaches, computer viruses, outages, systems failures, natural disasters, adverse public health developments, or other catastrophic events, any of which could include reputational damage, loss of our intellectual property, release of highly sensitive confidential information, the inability to access critical data, litigation with third parties and/or governmental investigations and fines, among other things, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our business partners maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world. This data relates to all aspects of our business, including financial information and current and future products under development, and also contains certain customer, supplier, partner and employee data. We maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data, but notwithstanding such protective measures, there is a risk of intrusion, cyberattacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data or make the data inaccessible to us. In addition, in certain cases, in order to conduct business, we outsource to third-party business partners. We generally obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect our data, and where applicable, that they will take steps to assure the protection of our data; nonetheless, those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or a cyberattack. Any compromise of the data could substantially disrupt our operations, harm our customers, employees and other business partners, damage our reputation, violate applicable laws and regulations, and subject us to potentially significant costs and liabilities.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, the state of California\u2019s California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective January 1, 2020, and more recently in August 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s Personal Information Protection Law (\u201cPIPL\u201d), which became effective on November 1, 2021, impose significant requirements and additional obligations for companies on how they collect, process and transfer personal data by enhancing consumer privacy rights and imposing significant fines for non-compliance. The potential for fines and other related costs in the event of a breach of or non-compliance with the GDPR, CCPA, PIPL or other existing or proposed information security or privacy laws and requirements may have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur business and financial results may be adversely affected by government contracting risks.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations applicable to parties doing business with the U.S. and other governments, including laws and regulations governing performance of government contracts, the use and treatment of government furnished property and the nature of materials used in our products. In the U.S., we may be unilaterally suspended or barred from conducting business with the U.S. government or its suppliers (both directly and indirectly), or\nbecome subject to fines or other sanctions if we are found to have violated such laws or regulations. As a result of the need to comply with these laws and regulations, we are subject to increased risks of governmental investigations, civil fraud actions, criminal prosecutions, whistleblower lawsuits and other enforcement actions. For example, in August 2018, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Inspector General, requesting documents pertaining to certain products manufactured by the Company\u2019s Military and Aerospace Group that are purchased or used by the U.S. government, as noted herein in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The U.S. laws and regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, Export Administration Regulations, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the False Claims Act, International Traffic in Arms Regulations, regulations from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the FCPA. We are subject to a wide range of similar laws and regulations in other countries throughout the world. Failure, or the perceived failure, to comply with applicable requirements also could harm our reputation and our ability to compete for future government contracts or sell commercial equivalent products. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\nIn addition, U.S. government contracts are subject to modification, curtailment or termination by the U.S. government without prior written notice, either for convenience or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. If our contracts are terminated by the U.S. government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the U.S. government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. We are also prohibited from assigning prime U.S. government contracts without the prior consent of the U.S. government contracting officer. Furthermore, the U.S. government periodically audits our governmental contract costs, which could result in fines, penalties or adjustment of costs and prices under the contracts. Any such fines, penalties or payment adjustments resulting from such audits could adversely affect our reputation, business, operations, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to governmental export and import controls.\nCertain of our products, including purchased components of such products, are subject to export controls and may be exported only with the required export license or through an export license exception. In addition, we are required to comply with certain U.S. and foreign sanctions and embargoes. These laws and regulations are complex, may change frequently and with limited notice, have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under recent U.S. administrations, especially in light of recent trade tensions with China. For example, in 2019, the U.S. government added certain of the Company\u2019s customers based in China to its \u201cEntity List\u201d, which imposes additional restrictions on sales to such customers. Although such restrictions did not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, the U.S. government has the power to place even greater restrictions on these and other customers, and such restrictions could further limit or prohibit the Company from selling products to such customers. If we were to fail to comply with these restrictions or applicable export licensing, customs regulations, economic sanctions and other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines for us, the incarceration of responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.\nChanges in fiscal and tax policies, audits and examinations by taxing authorities could impact the Company\u2019s results.\nThe Company is subject to tax in the U.S. and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently under tax examination in several jurisdictions, and, in addition, new examinations could be initiated by additional tax authorities. As the Company has operations in jurisdictions throughout the world, the risk of tax examinations will continue to occur. The Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be materially impacted by the results of these tax examinations.\nAny future changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting standards for income taxes and/or other tax guidance, including related interpretations, could materially impact the Company\u2019s current and non-current tax liabilities, along with deferred tax assets and liabilities, and consequently, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and, from time to time, we encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights, particularly in certain countries outside the U.S. We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors. Changes in laws concerning intellectual property, or the enforcement of such laws, may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are unpredictable. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.\nThe intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products. Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios. We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them. These third parties may include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse. In addition, some foreign competitors may take advantage of the intellectual property laws in their home countries and the more favorable litigation and regulatory environment to our detriment. Third party claims of infringement may result in loss of revenue, substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us.\nThe Company is subject to customer claims, litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings.\nThe Company is currently engaged in, or subject to, various customer claims, litigation and other regulatory and legal matters and may be subject to additional claims, litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings in the future. Such matters expose the Company to risks that could be material, including but not limited to, risks related to employment disputes, tax controversies, government investigations, intellectual property infringement, compliance with environmental laws, unfair sales practices, product safety and liability, and product warranty, indemnity and other contract-related claims. These matters may subject the Company to lawsuits, voluntary or forced product recalls, government investigations and criminal liability, including claims for compensatory, punitive or consequential damages, and could result in disruptions to our business and significant legal expenses. These matters could also damage our reputation, harm our relationships with customers or negatively affect product demand.\nWhile the Company does maintain certain insurance coverages that may mitigate losses associated with some of these types of claims and proceedings, the policies may not respond and, where insurance exists, the amount of insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total claims and liabilities. In some cases, particularly with respect to product warranty claims from customers, we self-insure against this risk, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from Company funds and not by insurance. Any current or future substantial liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.\nThe Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business.\nThe Company operates in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and we must comply with locally enacted laws and regulations addressing health, safety and environmental matters in such jurisdictions in which we manufacture and/or sell our products. Certain operations of the Company are subject to locally enacted environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company and its operations may be subject to liabilities, regardless of fault, for investigative and/or remediation efforts on such matters that may arise at any of the Company\u2019s former or current properties, either owned or leased. For example, as disclosed in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company was named as one of several defendants in four separate lawsuits filed in the State of Indiana relating to a manufacturing site in Franklin, Indiana where the Company has been conducting an environmental clean-up effort under the direction of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. All the costs incurred by the Company relating to these lawsuits as well as all costs associated with the clean-up effort at the manufacturing site have been reimbursed by the former owner pursuant to an indemnification agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition of the manufacturing site as part of a larger acquisition that led to the establishment of the Company\u2019s\nbusiness in 1987. Environmental liabilities can result from the use of hazardous materials in production, the disposal of products, damages associated with the use of any of our products or other related matters. We cannot be certain as to the potential impact of any changes to environmental conditions or environmental policies that may arise in any of our jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with these local environmental laws and regulations could result in fines or other punitive damages and/or modifications to our production processes as well as subject us to reputational harm, any of which could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe Company may be subject to incremental costs and risks associated with efforts to combat the negative effects of climate change.\nThere continues to be an increased global focus on climate change issues which has led to international treaties and agreements and legislative and regulatory efforts. In addition to the risks discussed under the heading \u201cThe Company may be negatively impacted by extreme weather conditions and natural catastrophic events, including those caused by climate change and global warming,\u201d the Company may also be subject to larger, global climate change initiatives, laws, regulations or orders. For example, in early 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, an international treaty focused on climate change, with several goals, including but not limited to, the reduction of greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions. More recently, in late 2021, the United States participated in the 2021 United National Climate Change Conference (\u201cCOP26\u201d). At the COP26, participating countries agreed on a new climate change-focused deal, the Glasgow Climate Pact, which marks the first-ever climate deal to explicitly commit to a reduction in coal use. The COP26 also resulted in many countries pledging to end deforestation and reduce methane emissions, among other pledges.\nGiven our global manufacturing presence, any future increased regulation surrounding GHG emissions and other climate change-related laws and regulations, beyond initiatives already in process at the Company, could subject us to additional and/or unforeseen compliance costs and limitations, including increased energy and raw material costs and capital expenditures. Any future regulatory changes in any of the countries in which we operate could result in transition risks to the Company, including but not limited to (i) the nature and timing of any requirement to lower GHG emissions and adopt more energy-efficient energy use, which could result in changes or disruptions to the way the Company operates, (ii) financial risks where the compliance with such regulations requires unforeseen capital expenditures and becomes costly or financially burdensome, (iii) legal risks associated with the failure to adapt to or comply with future climate change-related regulations, (iv) risks associated with the implementation of any new technologies required to comply with such regulations, which could impede our ability to innovate new products, meet customer and market demand or compete on pricing and quality in the market, and/or (v) reputational risks associated with our customers\u2019 and investors\u2019 perceptions of the Company and their preferences for maintaining relationships with companies with lower emissions, all of which could harm our reputation in the marketplace. We are not able to predict how any future definitive agreements, pacts and/or regulations, if and when they are adopted and required, and the commitments necessary to comply with such requirements, will affect our reputation, business, operations, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations in the future.", "PERMNO": 84769, "SIC": 3678, "TIC": "APH"}
