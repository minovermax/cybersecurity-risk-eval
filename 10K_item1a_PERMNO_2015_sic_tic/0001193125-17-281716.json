{"cik": "357020", "company": "Xcerra Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-09-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis Annual Report includes or incorporates forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties and fall within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 and Section 21E\nof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. You can identify these forward-looking statements by our use of the words \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cseeks\u201d or similar expressions, whether in the negative or affirmative. We cannot guarantee that we actually will achieve these plans, intentions or expectations. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. We have included below important factors that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, could be materially and adversely affected. These risks and uncertainties may be interrelated or co-related, and as a result, the occurrence of one risk might directly affect other risks described below, make them more likely to occur or magnify their impact. Moreover, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statement we make.\nThe proposed Merger may not be completed within the expected timeframe, or at all, and the failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business and the price of our common stock.\nThe closing of the Merger is subject to various customary conditions, including, among others, (i) adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our common stock, (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the HSR Act), (iii) filings and approvals with or by certain governmental authorities, including governmental authorities in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan and (iv) review and clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). In addition, the Merger Agreement may be terminated under specified circumstances. Failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022\nour current stock price likely reflects a market assumption that the proposed Merger will occur, meaning that a failure to complete the proposed Merger could result in a decline in the price of our common stock;\n\u2022\nwe have incurred, and continue to incur, significant transaction costs in connection with the proposed Merger, for which we will have received little or no benefit if the Merger is not completed. Many of these costs will be payable even if the Merger is not completed and may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than to complete the Merger;\n\u2022\na failed Merger may result in negative publicity and/or give a negative impression of us in the investment community or business community generally, and could have an adverse effect on our on-going operations including, but not limited to, retaining and attracting employees; and\n\u2022\nif the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Parent a termination fee.\nThe announcement and pendency of our proposed acquisition by Parent could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe announcement and pendency of the proposed Merger could disrupt our business and create uncertainty about it, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. These risks to our business, all of which could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Merger, include:\n\u2022\ndiversion of significant management and employee time and resources towards the completion of the Merger;\n\u2022\nimpairment of our ability to attract and retain key personnel;\n\u2022\ninability to take advantage of alternative business opportunities or effectively respond to competitive pressures or industry developments;\n\u2022\ndifficulties maintaining relationships with employees, customers and other business partners and suppliers;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the Merger, which prevent us from taking specified actions without the prior consent of Parent, which we might otherwise take in the absence of the Merger Agreement; and\n\u2022\npotential litigation relating to the Merger and the related costs of any such litigation.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, we may, under certain circumstances, be obligated to pay a termination fee to Parent. These costs could require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for other uses.\nIf the Merger is not completed, in certain circumstances, we could be required to pay a termination fee of $22.8 million to Parent. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, the termination fee we may be required to pay, if any, under the Merger Agreement may require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes or other uses. For these and other reasons, termination of the Merger Agreement could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, which in turn would materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur mergers and acquisitions may be costly, be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and divert management attention, which may limit our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products, technologies or engineers which could put a strain on our resources, result in one-time charges (such as acquisition-related expenses, write-offs or restructuring charges) or in the future, impairment of goodwill, cause ownership dilution to our stockholders and adversely affect our financial results. Additionally, we may fund future acquisitions by utilizing our cash, raising debt, issuing shares of our common stock, or by other means, which could subject us to the risks described below in \u201cWe may need financing, which could be difficult to obtain or limit our operational flexibility.\u201d We have also incurred and may continue to incur certain liabilities or other expenses in connection with acquisitions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky, and future mergers or acquisitions may not be successful and could materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Integrating newly acquired businesses, products or technologies into our company could put a strain on our resources, could be expensive and time consuming, may cause delays in product delivery and might not be successful. Future acquisitions and investments could divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and expose our business to unforeseen liabilities (including liabilities related to acquired intellectual property and other assets), unanticipated costs associated with transactions, and risks associated with entering new markets. In addition, we might lose key employees while integrating new organizations. We might not be successful in integrating any acquired businesses, products and product development projects, technologies, personnel, operations, or systems, and might not achieve anticipated revenues and cost benefits. Investments that we make may not result in a return consistent with our projections upon which such investments are made, or may require additional investment that we did not originally anticipate. In addition, future acquisitions could result in customer dissatisfaction, performance problems with an acquired company, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, possible impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangible assets or other unanticipated events or circumstances, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur primary market is the highly volatile semiconductor industry, which causes significant fluctuations in our financial results.\nWe sell capital equipment and peripheral connectivity products to companies that design, manufacture, assemble, and test semiconductor devices. The semiconductor industry is highly volatile, causing significant fluctuations on our financial results. Our business typically is negatively impacted in the second quarter of each fiscal year due to weak seasonality that occurs at this time of the year. The ability to forecast the business outlook for our industry is typically limited to three months. Regardless of our outlook and forecasts, any failure to expand in cycle upturns to meet customer demand and delivery requirements or contract in cycle downturns at a pace consistent with the industry could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAny significant downturn in the markets for our customers\u2019 semiconductor devices or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and would negatively impact our business. Downturns in the semiconductor test equipment and electronics manufacturing industries have been characterized by diminished product demand, excess production capacity, accelerated erosion of selling prices and excessive inventory levels. We believe the markets for newer generations of semiconductor devices and electronic products will also have similar characteristics. Our market is also characterized by rapid technological change and changes in customer demand. In the past, we have experienced delays in purchase commitments, delays in collecting accounts receivable and significant declines in demand for our products during these downturns, and we may not be able to maintain or exceed our current level of sales.\nAdditionally, as a capital equipment provider, our revenue is driven by the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers who often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to variations in their businesses. Because a high portion of our costs are fixed, we are limited in our ability to reduce expenses and inventory purchases quickly in response to decreases in orders and revenues. In an economic contraction, we may not be able to reduce our significant fixed costs, such as continued investment in research and development, capital equipment requirements and materials purchased from our suppliers.\nThe market for capital equipment is highly concentrated, and we have limited opportunities to sell our products.\nThe semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industries are highly concentrated, and a small number of semiconductor device manufacturers, contract assemblers, and electronics manufacturers account for a substantial portion of the purchases of capital equipment generally, including our equipment. We expect customer concentration to increase because of continuing consolidation in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Our top customer in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 was Spirox, which accounted for 15%, 19%, and 13%, respectively, of our net sales in those years. Sales to the top ten customers were 59%, 55%, and 54%, of net sales in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2015, respectively. Our customers may cancel orders with few or no penalties. If a major customer reduces orders for any reason, our revenues, operating results, and financial condition may be negatively affected.\nOur ability to increase our sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from new customers. Semiconductor and electronics manufacturers typically select a particular vendor\u2019s product for testing and handling its new generations of a device and make substantial investments to develop related test program applications and interfaces. Once a manufacturer has selected a test and/or handling system vendor for a new generation of a device, that manufacturer is more likely to purchase systems from that vendor for that generation of the device, and, possibly, subsequent generations of that device as well. Additionally, the continuing consolidation in the semiconductor manufacturing industry may slow or change capital equipment purchase decisions by customers. Therefore, the opportunities to obtain orders from new customers or existing customers that have combined with other companies may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow our revenue.\nOur substantial debt and financial obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to operate our business, we may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations, and we may incur additional debt.\nAs of July 31, 2017, our outstanding indebtedness was approximately $22.2 million. Our existing indebtedness and any additional indebtedness that we may incur in the future could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt agreements, including financial and operational restrictions;\n\u2022\nmaking it difficult for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our future ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business and the industries in which we compete;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with respect to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resource; and\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business.\nOur debt level and the terms of our financing arrangements could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy.\nWe may not be able to meet our debt service obligations, including our obligations under a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with ECT (together with us, the Borrowers), Silicon Valley Bank, as lender, administrative agent and issuing lender (SVB), and the several lenders from time to time part thereto (the Lenders) dated December 15, 2014. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured credit facility, consisting of a term loan facility, in favor of the Borrowers in the aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million which was advanced to us on December 15, 2014 (the Facility). If we are unable to maintain certain financial covenants, we would be in default under the Facility, which could permit the Lenders to accelerate the maturity of the Facility. Any such default could have material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial position and operating results, and could force us to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell our assets, borrow more money or raise equity. There is no guarantee that we would be able to take any of these actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us, or at all. In addition, we may not be able to repay amounts due in respect of our obligations, if payment of those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations.\nWe may need additional financing, which could be difficult to obtain or limit our operational flexibility.\nWe believe our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance of $160.7 million as of July 31, 2017 will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations for at least the next twelve months. However, we may need to raise additional funds in the future and, in such event, we may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms, if at all. Further, if we issue additional equity or equity-linked securities to obtain financing, stockholders may experience dilution. If we incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, the risks described above under \u201cOur substantial debt and financial obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to operate our business, we may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations, and we may incur additional debt\u201d would intensify.\nOur sales and operating results have fluctuated significantly from period to period, including from one quarter to another, and they may continue to do so.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that have had and could continue to have material and adverse effects on our financial condition and stock price or lead to significant variability in our operating results or our stock price, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe fact that sales of a limited number of test systems may account for a substantial portion of our net sales in any particular fiscal quarter;\n\u2022\norder cancellations by customers;\n\u2022\nlower gross margins in any particular period due to changes in:\n\u2022\nour product mix;\n\u2022\nthe configurations of test systems sold;\n\u2022\nthe customers to whom we sell our test systems; or\n\u2022\nvolume;\n\u2022\na long sales cycle due to the significant investment made by our customers in installing our test systems and the time required to incorporate our systems into our customers\u2019 design or manufacturing process; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the timing of product orders due to:\n\u2022\nunexpected delays in the introduction of products by our customers,\n\u2022\nexcess production capacity by our customers,\n\u2022\nshorter than expected lifecycles of our customers\u2019 semiconductor devices,\n\u2022\nuncertain market acceptance of products developed by our customers, or\n\u2022\nour own research and development.\nWe cannot predict the impact of these and other factors on our sales and operating results in any future period. Results of operations in any period, therefore, should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. Because of this difficulty in predicting future performance, our operating results may fall below expectations of securities analysts or investors in some future quarter or quarters. Our failure to meet these expectations would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nA substantial amount of the shipments of our systems for a particular quarter may occur late in the quarter. Our shipment pattern may expose us to significant risks of not meeting our expected financial results for each quarter in the event of problems during the complex process of final, test and acceptance prior to revenue recognition. If we were to experience problems of this type late in our quarter, shipments could be delayed and our operating results could fall below expectations.\nOur dependence on subcontractors and sole source suppliers may prevent us from delivering an acceptable product on a timely basis.\nWe rely on one subcontractor to manufacture our test systems and multiple other subcontractors for the manufacture of the components and subassemblies used to produce our test systems. Certain of the suppliers for certain components and subassemblies are sole source suppliers. We have no long term supply agreements with our test system contract manufacturers and purchase products through individual purchase orders. For all of our products, we may be required to qualify new or additional subcontractors and suppliers due to capacity constraints, competitive or quality concerns or other risks that may arise, including as a result of a change in\ncontrol of, or deterioration in the financial condition of, a supplier or subcontractor. The process of qualifying subcontractors and suppliers is lengthy. Our reliance on subcontractors gives us less control over the manufacturing process and exposes us to significant risks, especially inadequate capacity, late delivery, substandard quality, and high costs. In addition, the manufacture of certain of these components and subassemblies is an extremely complex process. If a supplier became unable to provide parts in the volumes needed, at the required standards of quality or at an acceptable price, we would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacement parts from alternative sources of supply or manufacture such components or subassemblies internally. The failure to qualify acceptable replacement subcontractors or suppliers quickly would delay the manufacturing and delivery of our products, which could cause us to lose revenues and customers.\nWe also may be unable to engage alternative sources for the production of our products on a timely basis or upon terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are required for any reason to seek a new manufacturer of our products, an alternate manufacturer may not be available and, in any event, transitioning to a new manufacturer would require a significant lead time of nine months or more and would involve substantial expense and disruption of our business. Our test systems are highly sophisticated and complex capital equipment, with many custom components, and final assembly requires specific technical know-how and expertise. These factors could make it more difficult for us to find a new manufacturer of our systems if our relationship with our outsource suppliers is terminated for any reason, which would cause us to lose revenues and customers.\nWe are dependent on certain semiconductor device manufacturers as sole source suppliers of certain sub-assemblies and components used in our test systems which are manufactured in accordance with our proprietary design and specifications. We have no written supply agreement with these sole source suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders. If one of our sole source suppliers were to fail to produce or provide the parts they agreed to build for us at the specifications, price or volume required, we would face a significant delay in the final production of our products because we do not have redundant capacity available, and our revenue and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nCompliance with current and future environmental regulations may be costly and disruptive to our operations.\nWe may be subject to environmental and other regulations due to our production and marketing of products in certain states and countries that limit or restrict the amount of hazardous material in certain electronic components such as PCBs. One such regulation is Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 that restricts the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. \u201cRoHS\u201d is short for restriction of hazardous substances. The RoHS Directive banned the placing on the European Union market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing more than agreed levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE), except where exemptions apply, from July 1, 2006. Manufacturers are required to ensure that their products, including their constituent materials and components, do not contain more than the minimum levels of the nine restricted materials in order to be allowed to export goods into the Single Market (i.e. of the European Community\u2019s 28 Member States). Any interruption in supply due to the unavailability of restriction free products could have a significant impact on the manufacturing and delivery of our products. If a supplier became unable to provide parts in the volumes needed or at an acceptable price, we would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements from alternative sources of supply or manufacture such components internally. As previously discussed, the failure to qualify acceptable replacements quickly would delay the manufacturing and delivery of our products, which could cause us to lose revenues and customers.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals may adversely affect us.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements in the event that the materials come from, or could have come from, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. These rules\nand verification requirements, which have applied to our activities since 2013 and will apply to our activities going forward, impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed.\nWe may not be able to deliver custom hardware options and related applications to satisfy specific customer needs in a timely manner.\nThe success of our business relies in substantial part on our ability to develop and deliver customized hardware and applications to meet our customers\u2019 specific requirements. Our equipment may fail to meet our customers\u2019 technical or cost requirements and may be replaced by competitive equipment or an alternative technology solution. Our inability to provide a test system that meets requested performance criteria when required by a device manufacturer would severely damage our reputation with that customer. This loss of reputation together with the risks discussed above under, \u201cThe market for capital equipment is highly concentrated, and we have limited opportunities to sell our products\u201d may make it substantially more difficult for us to sell systems to that manufacturer for a number of years. We have, in the past, experienced delays in introducing some of our products and enhancements.\nOur dependence on international sales and non-U.S. suppliers involves significant risk.\nInternational sales have constituted a significant portion of our revenues in recent years, and we expect that to continue. International sales accounted for 82% of our revenues for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, and 79% of our revenues for fiscal 2015. In addition, we rely on non-U.S. suppliers for several components of the equipment we sell. As a result, a major part of our revenues and the ability to manufacture our products are subject to the risks associated with international commerce. These international relationships make us particularly sensitive to economic, political, regulatory and environmental changes in the countries from which we derive sales and obtain supplies. Our sole source final assembly manufacturing supplier for our test systems in Malaysia increases our exposure to these types of international risks. International sales and our relationships with suppliers may be hurt by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in law or policy resulting in burdensome government controls, tariffs, restrictions, embargoes or export license requirements;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability in our target international markets;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles common in foreign markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulties of staffing and managing our international operations;\n\u2022\nless favorable foreign intellectual property laws making it harder to protect our technology from appropriation by competitors;\n\u2022\ndifficulties collecting our accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and similar laws; and\n\u2022\nadverse weather and climate events.\nIn the past, we have incurred expenses to meet new regulatory requirements in Europe, experienced periodic difficulties in obtaining timely payment from non-U.S. customers, and been affected by economic conditions in several Asian countries. Some of our foreign sales are invoiced and collected in U.S. dollars. A strengthening in the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies of those countries where we do business would increase the prices of our products as stated in those currencies and could hurt our sales in those countries. Significant fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could cause us to lower our prices and thus reduce\nour profitability. These fluctuations could also cause prospective customers to push out or delay orders because of the increased relative cost of our products. In the past, there have been significant fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of countries in which we do business. From time to time we may enter into foreign currency hedging arrangements.\nOur market is highly competitive, and we have limited resources to compete.\nThe semiconductor equipment and electronics manufacturing industries are highly competitive in all areas of the world. There are other domestic and foreign companies that participate in the markets for each of our products. Our competitors include Advantest Corporation and Teradyne Inc., Johnstech, MicroCraft, Cohu, Inc., SPEA, Shenzhen Mason Electronics Co., Ltd., Bojay, OXO, Sanmina, Interconnect Devices, Inc., QA Technology, and Ingun. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer support capabilities than we have.\nWe expect our competitors to enhance their current products and to introduce new products that may have comparable or better price and performance. The introduction of competing products could hurt sales of our current and future products. In addition, new competitors, including semiconductor and electronics manufacturers themselves, may offer new technologies, which may in turn reduce the value of our products. Increased competition could lead to intensified price-based competition, which would hurt our business and results of operations. Unless we are able to invest significant financial resources in developing products and maintaining customer support centers worldwide, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe are exposed to the risks associated with the volatility of the U.S. and global economies.\nSlow or negative growth in the domestic or global economies may continue to materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future. The strength of the domestic and global economies impact business capital spending and the sale of electronic goods and information technology equipment, which impacts our sales, revenues, and profits. The lack of visibility regarding whether there will be sustained growth in domestic and global economies creates uncertainty regarding the amount of our sales, and underscores the need for caution in predicting growth in the semiconductor test equipment industry in general and in our revenues and profits specifically. Our results of operations would be further adversely affected if we were to experience lower than anticipated order levels, cancellations of orders in backlog, extended customer delivery requirements or pricing pressure as a result of a slowdown. At lower levels of revenue, there is a higher likelihood that these types of changes in our customers\u2019 requirements would adversely affect our results of operations because in any particular quarter a limited number of transactions accounts for an even greater portion of sales for the quarter.\nWe are a multinational organization faced with increasingly complex tax issues in many jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes in various jurisdictions, including in the United States.\nAs a multinational organization, we are subject to taxation in jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operating results. In addition, the authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns and impose additional tax, interest and penalties, and the authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, any of which could have a material impact on us and the results of our operations.\nThere is growing pressure in many jurisdictions (including the United States) and from multinational organizations such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, and the European Union, or EU, to amend existing international tax rules in order to render them more responsive to\ncurrent global business practices. For example, the OECD has released guidance relating to various international tax related topics in an initiative referred to as Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, or BEPS, that aims to standardize and modernize global tax policy. Depending on the final form of the BEPS guidance and the legislation ultimately enacted by the OECD members, BEPS could have material adverse consequences on our effective tax rate, the amount of tax we pay and on our financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, some members of the U.S. Congress have recently begun publicly considering potential tax reform, including the possibility of replacing large parts of the existing federal income tax with a so-called \u201cdestination-based cash flow tax\u201d in addition to other potential tax reforms that the recently elected President and members of his administration may be considering.\nAlthough we monitor these developments, it is very difficult to assess to what extent these changes may be implemented in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we conduct our business or may impact the way in which we conduct our business or our effective tax rate due to the unpredictability and interdependency of these potential changes. Changes in tax laws and related regulations and practices could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, effective tax rate and financial position and results of operations.\nDevelopment of our products requires significant lead-time and expenditures, and we may fail to correctly anticipate the technical needs of our customers.\nOur systems are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their new semiconductor and electronics devices. We therefore must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers\u2019 semiconductor and electronics devices, requiring us to make significant capital investments to develop new equipment for our customers well before their devices are introduced. If our customers fail to introduce their devices in a timely manner or the market does not accept their devices, we may not recover our capital investment, in whole or in part. In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not generate revenue in excess of the costs of development, and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction of products embodying new technologies or features by our competitors. Furthermore, if we were to make announcements of product delays, or if our competitors were to make announcements of new systems, these announcements could cause our customers to defer or forego purchases of our systems, which would also hurt our business.\nWe may not be able to recover capital expenditures.\nWe continue to make capital expenditures in the ordinary course of our business. We may not be able to recover the expenditures for capital projects within the assumed timeframe, or at all, which may have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nWe have significant guarantees, indemnification and customer confidentiality obligations.\nFrom time to time, we make guarantees to customers regarding the delivery and performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness, performance obligations or lease commitments of our subsidiary and affiliate companies. We also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers, directors, employees and agents, to the extent permitted by law, arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer, director, employee or agent, is or was serving at our request in such capacity. Additionally, we have confidentiality obligations to certain customers. If we become liable under any of these obligations, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining key personnel.\nOur success depends substantially upon the continued service of our executive officers and key personnel, none of whom is bound by an employment or non-competition agreement. Our success also depends on our\nability to attract and retain highly qualified managers and technical, engineering, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for such specialized personnel is intense, and it may become more difficult for us to hire or retain them. Our volatile business cycles only aggravate this problem. If we implement layoffs during an industry downturn, our ability to hire or retain qualified personnel may be diminished. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by our inability to attract additional skilled employees.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain intellectual property rights and licenses and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering our products and development and testing tools. To that end, we have obtained certain domestic and international patents and may continue to seek patents on our inventions when appropriate. We have also obtained certain trademark registrations. The process of seeking intellectual property protection can be time consuming and expensive. We cannot ensure that:\n\u2022\npatents will issue from currently pending or future applications;\n\u2022\nour existing patents or any new patents will be sufficient in scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us;\n\u2022\nforeign intellectual property laws will protect our intellectual property rights; or\n\u2022\nothers will not independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our technology.\nIf we do not successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our operating results. We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and confidentiality provisions in agreements with employees and consultants to protect our intellectual property. Other parties may not comply with the terms of their agreements with us, and we may not be able to adequately enforce our rights against these parties.\nThird parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could incur significant litigation costs and licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products.\nIntellectual property rights are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We may be unknowingly infringing on the intellectual property rights of others and may be liable for that infringement, which could result in a significant liability for us. If we do infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we could be forced to either seek a license to intellectual property rights of others or alter our products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others. A license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all. Similarly, changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical.\nIf we were to become involved in a dispute regarding intellectual property, whether ours or that of another company, we may have to participate in legal proceedings. These types of proceedings may be costly and time consuming for us, even if we eventually prevail. If we do not prevail, we might be forced to pay significant damages, obtain licenses, modify our products or processes, stop making products or stop using processes.\nIn the future we may be subject to litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to litigation or other administrative and governmental proceedings that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and, in the event of an adverse decision, pay damages in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nProduct defects and any damages stemming from product liability could harm our reputation among existing and potential customers and could have a material adverse effect upon our business results and financial condition\nWe cannot guarantee that there are no defects in the products we manufacture or that our product liability insurance will sufficiently cover the ultimate amount of any damages caused by such defects. Large scale accidents due to product defects or any discovery of defects in our products could harm our reputation, result in claims for damages, and have a material adverse effect upon our business results and financial condition.\nOur operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers are subject to risks of natural catastrophic events, widespread health epidemics, acts of war, and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks, any one of which could result in cancellation of orders, delays in deliveries or other business activities, or loss of customers and could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nOur operations and those of our customers and suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, health epidemics, fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, energy shortages, telecommunication failures, tsunamis, flooding or other natural disasters. Such disruption could materially increase our costs and expenses as well as cause delays in, among other things, shipments of products to our customers, our ability to perform services requested by our customers, or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites. Any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations.\nDamage, interference or interruption to our information technology networks and systems could hinder business continuity and lead to substantial costs or harm to our reputation.\nWe rely on various information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, including confidential data, and to carry out and support a variety of business activities, including manufacturing, research and development, supply chain management, sales and accounting. Attacks by hackers or computer viruses, wrongful use of the information security system, careless use, accidents or disasters could undermine the defenses we have established for these systems and disrupt business continuity, which could not only risk leakage or tampering of information but could also result in a legal claim, litigation, damages liability or an obligation to pay fines. If this were to occur, our reputation could be harmed, we could incur substantial costs, and it may have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and results of operation.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nIn the twelve months ended July 31, 2017, our stock price ranged from a low of $5.14 to a high of $10.01. The price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of events and factors, such as:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nvariances of our quarterly results of operations from securities analysts\u2019 estimates;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new products, acquisitions or strategic alliances; and\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends in our markets.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for semiconductor-related and electronics manufacturing companies in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies affected by these fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nWe may record impairment charges, which would adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe review our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable, in accordance with FASB Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other to the FASB ASC. We also review our other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable.\nOne potential indicator of goodwill impairment is whether our fair value, as measured by our market capitalization, has remained below our net book value for a significant period of time. Whether our market capitalization triggers an impairment charge in any future period will depend on the underlying reasons for the decline in stock price, the significance of the decline, and the length of time the stock price has been trading at such prices.\nIn the event that we determine in a future period that impairment exists for any reason, we would record an impairment charge, which would reduce the underlying asset\u2019s value in the period such determination is made, which would adversely impact our financial position and results of operations\nInternal control deficiencies or weaknesses that are not yet identified could emerge.\nOver time we may identify and correct deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal controls and, where and when appropriate, report on the identification and correction of these deficiencies or weaknesses. However, our internal control procedures can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that deficiencies or weaknesses are identified. Deficiencies or weaknesses that have not been identified by us could emerge and the identification and correction of these deficiencies or weaknesses could have a material impact on our results of operations. If our internal control over financial reporting are not considered adequate, we may experience a loss of public confidence, which could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nFluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nOur results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected as a result of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that reduce the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar, increase our costs and expenses and otherwise harm our business. Although our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a sizable portion of our revenues and costs are denominated in other currencies, primarily the Euro. Any hedging strategies that we may use in an effort to reduce the adverse impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may not be successful. In addition, our foreign currency exposure on assets and liabilities for which we do not hedge could have a material impact on our results of operations in periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to unhedged non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business.", "PERMNO": 48291, "SIC": 3825, "TIC": "XCRA"}
