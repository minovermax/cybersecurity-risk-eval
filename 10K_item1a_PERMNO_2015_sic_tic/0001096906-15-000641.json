{"cik": "1289636", "company": "PROFIRE ENERGY INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the risks discussed throughout this report we are subject to the following risks.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nChanges in the level of capital-spending by our customers could materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nOur principal customers are oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Our results of operations and financial condition depend on the level of capital spending by our customers. The energy industry\u2019s level of capital spending is tied to the prevailing commodity prices of natural gas and crude oil. Low commodity prices have the potential to reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas that our customers can economically produce, and volatility in commodity prices may make our customers reluctant to invest in oilfields where our products would be used. Although our products can enhance the operational efficiency of producing wells, a prolonged or substantial downturn in market price could lead to reductions or delays in the capital spending of our clients and therefore reduce the demand for our products and services, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nOur business depends on spending by the oil and gas industry; this spending and our business may be materially and adversely affected by industry conditions that are beyond our control.\nWe depend on our customers\u2019 willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to transport, refine and produce oil and natural gas. Industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, such as:\n\u00b7\nthe level of oil and gas production;\n\u00b7\nthe demand for oil and gas related products;\n\u00b7\ndomestic and worldwide economic conditions;\n\u00b7\npolitical instability in the Middle East and other oil producing regions;\n\u00b7\nthe actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n\u00b7\nthe price of foreign imports of oil and gas, including liquefied natural gas;\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters or weather conditions, such as hurricanes;\n\u00b7\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u00b7\nthe level of oil and gas inventories;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of producing oil and gas;\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u00b7\nmerger and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers; and\n\u00b7\ngovernmental regulations.\nThe volatility of the oil and gas industry and the consequent impact on the transportation, refinement and production of oil and natural gas could cause a decline in the demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in the dependence on crude oil and natural gas as major energy sources worldwide could materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nOur principal customers are oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. If new energy sources are further developed and adopted, our principal customers could experience a decline in demand for their products. If demand for customer products decreases, the business and financial condition of our customers could be materially and adversely impacted. Significant negative financial impact of our customers could reduce the demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur assets and operations, as well as the assets and operations of our customers, could be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena.\nOur assets and operations could be adversely affected by natural phenomena, such as tornados, earthquakes, wildfire, and landslides. A significant disruption in our operations or the operations of our customers due to weather or other natural phenomena could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nChanges in foreign exchange rates in countries where our business operates could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nA sizable portion of our consolidated revenue and consolidated operating expenses is in foreign currencies. As a result, we are subject to significant risks, including:\n\u00b7\nforeign currency exchange risks resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the execution of controls in this area;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund our operations in other countries.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business in Canada, whose currency lost substantial value compared to the United States Dollar (USD) during fiscal year 2015. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted our financial results in fiscal year 2015 and if there is prolonged downturn in the Canadian Dollar/USD exchange rate it could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nThe attractive nature of the oilfield services industry could lead to an increase of direct competitors.\nThe oilfield services industry is highly competitive. As our segment within the oil and gas exploration and production industry grows and matures we expect additional companies will seek to enter this market. New entrants to our industry may be more highly capitalized, more experienced, better recognized or better situated to take advantage of market opportunities. Any failure by us to adequately compete against current and future competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nOur future business strategies may include growth through the acquisitions of other businesses. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities or successfully acquire those opportunities that are identified. The possibility exists that even if there is success in integrating future acquisitions into existing operations, we may not derive the benefits, such as administrative or operational synergy or earnings obtained, that were expected from such acquisitions, which may result in the commitment of capital resources without the expected returns on the capital. The competition for acquisition opportunities may increase which in turn would increase our cost of making acquisitions.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, from time to time we evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions. To be successful, we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies, negotiate transaction terms, complete transactions and manage post-closing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses. We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities.\nThe risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture;\n\u00b7\nwe may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business;\n\u00b7\nwe may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases; and\n\u00b7\nwe may experience complexities associated with managing the combined businesses and consolidating multiple physical locations.\nThere can be no assurance as to the extent to which the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions will be realized, if at all, or that significant time and costs beyond those anticipated will not be required with the integration of new acquisitions to the existing business. If we are unable to accomplish the integration and management successfully, or achieve a substantial portion of the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions within the time frames anticipated by management, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and attention. They may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction. Failure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur proposed business strategies described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K incorporate our management\u2019s current analysis of potential markets, opportunities and difficulties that we face.\nWe cannot assure any party that our underlying assumptions accurately reflect current trends and conditions in our industry or that our current business strategy will be successful. Our business strategies may change substantially from time to time or may be abandoned as our management reassesses opportunities and reallocates resources. If we are unable to develop or implement our strategies, we may not operate profitably in future periods.\nOur operations involve operating hazards, which, if not insured or indemnified against, could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in our technology\u2019s use in oilfield service operations, oilfield development and oil production activities, including fire, explosions, blowouts, spills and damage or loss from natural disasters, each of which could result in substantial damage to the oil-producing formations and oil wells, production facilities, other property, equipment and the environment or in personal injury or loss of life. These hazards could also result in the suspension of purchasing or in claims by employees, customers or third parties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nSome of these risks are either not insurable or insurance is available only at rates that we consider uneconomical. Although we will maintain liability insurance in an amount that we consider consistent with industry practice, the nature of these risks is such that liabilities could exceed policy limits. We may not always be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification from our customers, and customers who provide contractual indemnification protection may not maintain adequate insurance or otherwise have the financial resources necessary to support their indemnification obligations. Our insurance or indemnification arrangements may not adequately protect us against liability or loss from all the hazards of our operations. The occurrence of a significant event that we have not fully insured or indemnified against or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges to governmental regulation of the oil and gas industry could materially and adversely affect our business.\nIf the laws and regulations governing oil and natural gas exploration and production were to become less stringent, we could experience a significant decline in the demand for our products, which we would expect would materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. These regulations are subject to change and new regulations may curtail or eliminate customer activities in certain areas where we currently operate. We cannot determine the extent to which new legislation may impact customer activity levels, and ultimately, the demand for our products and services.\nFurther, our operations are affected by local, provincial, state, federal and foreign laws and other regulations relating to oil, gas and electric standards. Such standards can be related to safety, environmental protection, or other regulatory dimensions for the oil and gas industry. We cannot predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations, how such existing laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings, whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted, or the effect such changes may have on us, our business or financial condition.\nAnti-fracking regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition.\nCertain states and municipalities have regulated, or are considering regulating, hydraulic fracturing (\u201cfracking\u201d), which, if accomplished, could impact some of our customers and their operations. While we do not believe that these fracking related regulations or considerations of future related regulations negatively impacted our activities to date, there can be no assurance that these actions, if taken on a wider scale, may not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.\nFailure to comply with applicable environmental and other laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and harm our results of operations.\nWe may use hazardous materials in our research and development and manufacturing processes, which are subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulations. These regulations govern the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and hazardous waste products that we generate. Although we believe that our procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of hazardous materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials and we may incur liability as a result of any such contamination or injury. In the event of an accident, including a discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our insurance and other resources. We have also incurred and may continue to incur expenses related to compliance with environmental laws. Such future expenses or liability could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we cannot assure you that the cost of complying with these laws and regulations will not materially increase in the future.\nWe are also subject to various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including new or revised safety or environmental standards, could give rise to significant liability and require us to incur substantial expenses and could materially harm our results of operations.\nOur international operations involve additional risks not associated with our domestic operations.\nWe intend to continue our expansion into international oil and gas producing areas. The effect on our international operations from the risks we describe will not be the same in all countries and jurisdictions. Risks associated with our operations outside of the United States include risks of:\n\u00b7\nmultiple, conflicting, and changing laws and regulations, export and import restrictions, and employment laws;\n\u00b7\nregulatory requirements, and other government approvals, permits, and licenses;\n\u00b7\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic instability, including wars and acts of terrorism, political unrest, boycotts, curtailments of trade and sanctions, and other business restrictions;\n\u00b7\nexpropriation, confiscation or nationalization of assets;\n\u00b7\nrenegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties and costs in recruiting and retaining individuals skilled in international business operations;\n\u00b7\nforeign exchange restrictions;\n\u00b7\nforeign currency fluctuations;\n\u00b7\nforeign taxation;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to repatriate earnings or capital;\n\u00b7\nchanging foreign and domestic monetary policies;\n\u00b7\ncultural and communication challenges;\n\u00b7\nindustry-process differences;\n\u00b7\nregional economic downturns; and\n\u00b7\nforeign governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of contracts to local contractors or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction that may harm our ability to compete.\nSanctions by the U.S. government against certain companies and individuals in Russia and Ukraine may hinder our ability to conduct business with potential or existing customers in these countries.\nWhile we have not historically derived significant revenue from business in either Russia or Ukraine, the continuation or escalation of the current geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine could negatively impact our future operations, sales, and future growth prospects in that region. Recently, the U.S. government imposed sanctions through several executive orders restricting U.S. companies from conducting business with specified Russian and Ukrainian individuals and companies. The sanctions imposed by the U.S. government may be expanded in the future to restrict us from engaging with existing and potential customers. If we are unable to conduct business with new or existing customers or pursue opportunities in Russia or Ukraine, our business, including revenue, profitability and cash flows, could be adversely affected.\nOur business has potential liability for litigation, personal injury and property damage claims assessments.\nMost of our products are used in hazardous production applications and involve exposure to inherent risks, including explosions and fires, where an accident or a failure of a product could result in liability for personal injury, loss of life, property damage, pollution or other environmental hazards or loss of production. Litigation may arise from a catastrophic occurrence at a location where our equipment and services are used. This litigation could result in large claims for damages, including consequential damages, and could impair the market\u2019s acceptance of our products. The frequency and severity of such incidents could affect our operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators. These occurrences could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur business may be subject to product liability claims or product recalls, which could be expensive and could result in a diversion of management\u2019s attention.\nThe oil industry experiences significant product liability claims. As an installer and servicer of oilfield combustion management technologies and related products, we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products, or the equipment into which our products are incorporated, could malfunction and result in personal injury or death. We may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our technology, products or services caused or contributed to the accidents. Product liability claims could result in significant losses as a result of expenses incurred in defending claims or the award of damages. In addition, we may be required to participate in recalls involving our products if any of our products prove to be defective, or we may voluntarily initiate a recall or make payments related to such claims as a result of various industry or business practices or the need to maintain good customer relationships. We cannot assure you that our product liability insurance will be sufficient to cover all product liability claims, that such claims will not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that such insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any product liability claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nUninsured or underinsured claims or litigation or an increase in our insurance premiums could adversely impact our results of operations.\nAlthough we maintain insurance protection for certain risks in our business and operations, we are not fully insured against all possible risks, nor are all such risks insurable. It is possible an unexpected judgment could be rendered against us in cases in which we could be uninsured or underinsured and beyond the amounts we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring. Significant increases in the cost of insurance and more restrictive coverage may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims and assessments that may arise.\nLiability to customers under warranties may materially and adversely affect our earnings.\nWe provide warranties as to the proper operation and conformance to specifications of the products we sell. Failure of our products to operate properly or to meet specifications may increase our costs by requiring additional engineering resources and services, replacement of parts and equipment or monetary reimbursement to a customer. We have in the past received warranty claims, and we expect to continue to receive them in the future. To the extent that we incur substantial warranty claims in any period, our reputation, our ability to obtain future business and our earnings could be adversely affected.\nSome of our products use equipment and materials that are available from a limited number of suppliers.\nWe purchase equipment provided by a limited number of manufacturers. During periods of high demand, these manufacturers may not be able to meet our requests for timely delivery, resulting in delayed deliveries of equipment and higher prices for equipment. There are a limited number of suppliers for certain materials used in burner management systems, our largest product line. Although these materials are generally available, supply disruptions may occur due to factors beyond our control. Such disruptions, delayed deliveries, and higher prices could limit our ability to provide services, or could increase the costs of providing services, thus possibly reducing revenues and profits.\nDependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation.\nAs part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we outsource our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers\u2019 orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays.\nHistorically, we have depended on a few major customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and our revenue could decline if we are unable to maintain those relationships, if customers reduce their orders for their products, or if we are unable to secure new customers.\nHistorically, we have derived a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers. For the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, sales to our largest four customers accounted for approximately 31% and 47%, respectively, of our revenue. While we continually seek to broaden our customer base, it is likely that for the foreseeable future we will remain dependent on these customers to supply a substantial portion of our revenue. Relationships with our customers are based on purchase orders rather than long-term formal supply agreements, and customers can discontinue or materially reduce orders without warning or penalty. Demand for our products is tied directly to the health of the oil industry. Accordingly, factors that affect the oil industry have a direct effect on our business, including factors outside of our control, such as sales slowdowns due to economic concerns, or as a result of natural disasters. The loss of one or more of our significant customers, or reduced demand from one or more of our significant customers, would result in an adverse effect on our revenue, our profitability, and our ability to continue our business operations.\nWe are exposed to risks of delay, cancellation, and nonpayment by customers in the ordinary course of our business activities.\nWe are exposed to risks of loss in the event of delay, cancellation, and nonpayment by our customers. Our customers are subject to their own operating and regulatory risks and may be highly leveraged. We may experience financial losses in our dealings with other parties. Any delay and any increases in the cancellation of contracts or nonpayment by our customers and/or counterparties could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operating results for certain components of our business may fluctuate on a seasonal basis.\nRevenues from the sale of our products can fluctuate depending on the season. The demand for oil, natural gas and other fuels peak during the winter months. Since oil and natural gas producers make up our customer base, the demand for our products could fluctuate seasonally with the demand for oil and natural gas and drilling seasonality. Demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the location of our customers.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be materially adversely affected if we are unable to obtain and maintain effective intellectual property rights for our technologies and planned products, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection is not sufficiently broad.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection with respect to our proprietary technology and products. In recent years patent rights have been the subject of significant litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of the patent rights is highly uncertain. Pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the same, especially in jurisdictions which we hope to secure protection, may diminish the value of patents or narrow the scope of patent protection. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications, in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we or were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Even if the patent applications we rely on issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope, validity or enforceability, and patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the U.S. and abroad. Such challenges may result in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop or prevent us from stopping others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours or otherwise provide us with a competitive advantage.\nWhile we are not currently engaged in any material intellectual property litigation, in the future we may commence lawsuits against others if we believe they have infringed our rights. We cannot be assured that we would be successful in any such litigation. Our involvement in any intellectual property litigation could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources, may adversely affect the development of sales of our products or intellectual property, our capital resources, or may divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our planned products throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive to us. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement is not as strong as in the U.S. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents, and our intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries may not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of any patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce any patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected, harming our business and competitive position.\nSome of our proprietary intellectual property is not protected by any patent, copyright or patent or copyright applications, and, despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use such intellectual property without authorization. We rely upon confidential proprietary information, including trade secrets, unpatented know-how, technology, software, and other proprietary information, to develop and maintain our competitive position. Any disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential proprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in the market. We seek to protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees and our collaborators and consultants. We also have agreements with our employees and selected consultants that obligate them to assign their inventions to us. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information; however, we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, or that technology relevant to our business will not be independently developed by a person that is not a party to such an agreement. Furthermore, if the employees, consultants or collaborators that are parties to these agreements breach or violate the terms of these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation, and we could lose our trade secrets through such breaches or violations. Further, our trade secrets could be disclosed, misappropriated or otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. In addition, intellectual property laws in foreign countries may not protect trade secrets and confidential information to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. If we are unable to prevent disclosure of the intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which would harm our ability to protect our rights and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our distributors, contract manufacturers, and suppliers to manufacture, market, and sell our products, and to use our proprietary technologies without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the proprietary rights or intellectual property of third parties. While we are not aware of any issued or pending patent applications that could restrict our ability to operate, we may in the future become party to, or be threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights. If we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may be temporarily or permanently prohibited from commercializing our products that are held to be infringing. We might, if possible, also be forced to redesign our products so that we no longer infringe the third party intellectual property rights, or we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. We may also elect to enter into such a license in order to settle pending or threatened litigation. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us, and could require us to pay significant royalties and other fees. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our products or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business.\nEven if we are successful in defending against intellectual property claims, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to such claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of litigation or other intellectual property related proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we do not develop and commercialize new competitive products, our revenue may decline.\nTo remain competitive in the market for oilfield combustion management technologies, we must continue to develop and commercialize new products. If we are not able to develop commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to industry demands, our business and revenues will be adversely affected. Our future ability to develop new products depends on our ability to:\n\u00b7\ndesign and commercially produce products that meet the needs of our customers;\n\u00b7\nattract and retain talented research-and-development management and personnel;\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully market new products; and\n\u00b7\nprotect our proprietary designs from our competitors.\nWe may encounter resource constraints or technical or other difficulties that could delay introduction of new products and services. Our competitors may introduce new products before we do and achieve a competitive advantage.\nAdditionally, the time and expense invested in product development may not result in commercial products or provide revenues. We could be required to write off our entire investment in a new product that does not reach commercial viability. Moreover, we may experience operating losses after new products are introduced and commercialized because of high start-up costs, unexpected manufacturing costs or problems, or lack of demand.\nNew technologies could render our existing products obsolete.\nNew developments in technology may negatively affect the development or sale of some or all of our products or make our products obsolete. Our success depends upon our ability to design, develop and market new or modified combustion management technologies and related products. Our inability to enhance existing products in a timely manner or to develop and introduce new products that incorporate new technologies, conform to stringent regulatory standards and performance requirements and achieve market acceptance in a timely manner could negatively impact our competitive position. New product development or modification is costly, involves significant research, development, time and expense and may not necessarily result in the successful commercialization of any new products.\nOur business and financial condition could be negatively impacted if we lose the services of certain members of senior management including the anticipated resignation of Andrew W. Limpert as our CFO.\nOur development to date has largely depended, and in the future will continue to largely depend, on the efforts of our senior management. We currently do not have key-person insurance for Brenton W. Hatch, CEO, Harold Albert, COO, or Andrew W. Limpert, CFO; however, our historical revenue growth, uplisting to Nasdaq, and corporate expansion-and the increased visibility and shareholder expectations entailed with such-could make the risks associated with the departures of such individuals greater than in the past. Mr. Limpert, our CFO, notified the Company of his intended resignation as an officer and director effective June 15, 2015. Mr. Limpert\u2019s expected departure and future departures by other members of our senior management could have a negative impact on our business, as we may not be able to find suitable personnel to replace departing members on a timely basis or at all. The loss of any member of our senior management could impair our ability to execute our business plan and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailing to attract and retain skilled employees could impair our growth potential and profitability.\nOur ability to remain productive and profitable depends substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees. Our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force. The demand for skilled oilfield employees is high and the supply is limited. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates paid by us, or both. If either of these events were to occur, our capacity and profitability could be diminished, and our growth potential could be impaired.\nIf we are unable to expand into new markets, our ability to grow our business as profitability as planned could be materially and adversely effected.\nAs market conditions improve, we intend to continue to pursue our aggressive growth strategy for the foreseeable future. Future operating results will depend largely upon our ability to expand to new markets and increase sales. To support this growth, we have and will continue to expand our marketing expenditures, add new employees and open additional offices in as prudent manner as possible. There can be no assurance that we will be able to expand our market share in our existing markets or successfully enter new or contiguous markets. Nor can there be any assurance that such expansion will not adversely affect our profitability and results of operations. If we are unable to enter into new markets, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to manage growth effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur ability to successfully expand to new markets, or expand our penetration in existing markets, depends on a number of factors including:\n\u00b7\nour ability to market our products and services to new customers;\n\u00b7\nour ability to provide increasingly large-scale support and training materials for a growing customer base;\n\u00b7\nour ability to hire, train and assimilate new employees;\n\u00b7\nthe adequacy of our financial resources; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to correctly identify and exploit new geographical markets and to successfully compete in those markets.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion, that our products will gain access to new markets or be accepted in new marketplaces, achieve greater market penetration in existing markets or that we will achieve planned operating results or results comparable to those we experience in existing markets, in the new markets we enter.\nOur stock options and other equity-based awards to employees may not have their intended effect.\nA portion of our total compensation program for key personnel has historically included awards of options to buy our common stock or other equity-based awards. If the price of our common stock performs poorly, such performance may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract critical personnel. In addition, any changes made to our equity compensation policies, or to any other of our compensation practices, which are made necessary by governmental regulations or competitive pressures could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel.\nRisks Relating to our Stock\nOur common stock lacks liquidity.\nA significant percentage of our outstanding common stock is \u201crestricted\u201d and therefore subject to the resale restrictions set forth in Rule 144 of the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933. These factors could adversely affect the liquidity, trading volume, price and transferability of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile, and fluctuates widely in price in response to various factors which are beyond our control. The price of our common stock is not necessarily indicative of our operating performance or long-term business prospects. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Factors such as the following could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially:\n\u00b7\nthe underlying price of the commodities in the oil and gas industry;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of capital budget changes by a major customer;\n\u00b7\nthe introduction of new products by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of technology advances by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\ncurrent events affecting the political and economic environment in the United States or Canada;\n\u00b7\nconditions or trends in the industry, including demand for our products and services and technological advances;\n\u00b7\nchanges to financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of our key personnel;\n\u00b7\ngovernment regulation of our industry;\n\u00b7\nseasonal, economic, or financial conditions;\n\u00b7\nour quarterly operating and financial results; or\n\u00b7\nlitigation or public concern about the safety of our products.\nThe realization of any of these risks and other factors beyond our control could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. In particular, the market price of our common stock may be influenced by variations in oil and gas prices, because demand for our products and services is closely related to those products.\nThe stock market in general experiences, from time to time, extreme price and volume fluctuations. Periodic and/or continuous market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock. Price volatility may be worse if the trading volume of our common stock is low.\nOur existing shareholders could experience further dilution if we elect to raise equity capital to meet our liquidity needs or to finance strategic transactions.\nAs part of our future growth strategy, we may desire to raise capital and or utilize our common stock to effect strategic business transactions, either of which will likely require that we issue equity (or debt) securities which would result in dilution to our existing stockholders. Although we anticipate attempting to minimize the dilutive impact of any future capital-raising activities or business transactions, we cannot offer any assurance that we will be effectively able to do so.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception that future sales may occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, even if our business is doing well.\nAs of May 26, 2015, we had 53,199,021 shares of our common stock outstanding, and options outstanding that are exercisable into 2,113,500 shares of our common stock. If any significant number of our outstanding shares are sold, such sales could have a depressive effect on the market price of our stock. We are unable to predict the effect, if any, that the sale of shares, or the availability of shares for future sale, will have on the market price of the shares prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress prevailing market prices for the shares. Such sales may also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price, which we deem appropriate.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting.\nWe are required by the SEC to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We are likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls. In Item 9A, we disclose that with respect to the standards of Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404, the internal controls-standard to which we are now audited, as of March 31, 2015 we reported material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. For additional information on this item, please see Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nAlthough we believe our historical efforts have strengthened our internal control over financial reporting (and we concluded that our financial statements were reliable, notwithstanding the material weakness we reported), we cannot be certain that our revised internal control practices will ensure that we will have or maintain adequate internal control over our financial reporting in future periods. Any failure to have or maintain such internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results accurately and on a timely basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the SEC and NASDAQ, we could face severe consequences from those authorities. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe could issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without stockholder approval with the effect of diluting existing stockholders and impairing their voting rights, and provisions in our charter documents and under Nevada corporate law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board. Our Board is empowered, without stockholder approval, to authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights which could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, our common stockholders. The issuance of a series of preferred stock could be used as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control. For example, it would be possible for the Board to authorize preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to effect a change in control of our company.\nAny aspect of the foregoing, alone or together, could delay or prevent unsolicited takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future, and therefore investors should not buy our stock if they wish to receive cash dividends.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our common stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings to support operations and to finance expansion and, therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent on the amount of funds legally available, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. Accordingly, you will need to rely on sales of your common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, in order to realize a return on your investment.\nOur management has a substantial ownership interest in our common stock and the availability of our common stock to the investing public may be limited.\nThe availability of our common stock to the investing public may be limited to those shares not held by our executive officers, directors and their affiliates, which could negatively impact our trading prices and affect the ability of our minority stockholders to sell their shares. Future sales by executive officers, directors and their affiliates of all or a portion of their shares could also negatively affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur management has significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval.\nOur management owns approximately 59% of our common stock, as of May 26, 2015. As a result, our management has sufficient voting power to control the outcome of many matters requiring shareholder approval. These matters may include:\n\u00b7\nthe composition of our Board, which has the authority to direct our business, appoint and remove our officers, and declare dividends;\n\u00b7\napproving or rejecting a merger, consolidation or other business combination;\n\u00b7\nraising future capital; and\n\u00b7\namending our articles of incorporation and bylaws.\nThis concentration of ownership of our common stock could delay or prevent proxy contests, mergers, tender offers, open-market purchase programs or other purchases of our common stock that might otherwise give our other stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may also adversely affect our share price. The interests of our management may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. Furthermore, this concentration of ownership may delay, prevent or deter a change in control, or deprive you of a possible premium for your common stock as part of a sale of our company.\nWe may not be able to maintain compliance with The NASDAQ Capital Market\u2019s continued listing requirements.\nOur common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. There are a number of continued listing requirements that we must satisfy in order to maintain our listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market. If we fail to maintain compliance with all applicable continued listing requirements for The NASDAQ Capital Market and NASDAQ determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock, our ability to obtain financing to repay any future debt we could incur and fund our operations.", "PERMNO": 14548, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "PFIE"}
