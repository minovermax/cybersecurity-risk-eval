RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a number of risks. You should carefully consider the risks described in \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d in addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before investing in our securities. These risks could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and cause the trading price of our securities to decline. You could lose part or all of your investment. You should bear in mind, in reviewing this Form 10-K, that past experience is no indication of future performance. You should read the section titled \u201cCautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of what types of statements are forward-looking statements, as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business depends on capital spending by the oil and natural gas industry, and reductions in capital spending could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business is directly affected by the capital spending of E&P companies to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the United States and Argentina. The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices that began in late 2014 caused a reduction in the exploration, development and production activities of most of these companies. These cuts in spending have curtailed drilling programs, which has resulted in a reduction in the demand for our services as compared to activity levels in late 2014, as well as the prices we can charge. In addition, certain of these companies could become unable to pay their vendors and service providers, including us, as a result of the decline in commodity prices. Reduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves in our areas of operation as a result of decreased capital spending may also have a negative long-term impact on our business, even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices. Any of these conditions or events could adversely affect our operating results. If the recent recovery in oil and natural gas prices does not continue or E&P companies fail to further increase their capital spending, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIndustry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u25cf domestic and foreign economic conditions and supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf the level of prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;\n\u25cf the level of domestic and global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u25cf the supply of and demand for pressure pumping services and equipment in the United States and Argentina;\n\u25cf federal, state and local regulation of hydraulic fracturing and exploration and production activities, and U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. governmental regulations and taxes as well as public pressure on governmental bodies and regulatory agencies to regulate our industry;\n\u25cf governmental regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u25cf political and economic conditions in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u25cf actions by the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) with respect to oil production levels and announcements of potential changes in such levels, including the failure of such countries to comply with announced production cuts;\n\u25cf worldwide political, military and economic conditions;\n\u25cf the cost of producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf the discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u25cf shareholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf the availability of water resources, suitable proppant and chemicals in sufficient quantities for use in hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u25cf advances in exploration, development and production technologies or in technologies affecting energy consumption;\n\u25cf the potential acceleration of development of alternative fuels; and\n\u25cf uncertainty in capital and commodities markets and the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise equity capital and debt financing.\nThe volatility of oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect the demand for our services and adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe demand for our services is primarily determined by current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices and the related levels of capital spending and drilling activity in the areas in which we have operations. Volatility or weakness in oil prices or natural gas prices (or the perception that oil prices or natural gas prices will decrease) affects the spending patterns of E&P companies and may result in the drilling of fewer new wells. This, in turn, could lead to lower demand for our services and may cause lower utilization of our assets. We may experience significant fluctuations in operating results as a result of the reactions of E&P companies to changes in oil and natural gas prices. For example, prolonged low commodity prices experienced by the oil and natural gas industry beginning in late 2014 and uncertainty about future prices even when prices increased, combined with adverse changes in the capital and credit markets, caused many E&P companies to significantly reduce their capital budgets and drilling activity. This resulted in a significant decline in demand for oilfield services and adversely impacted the prices oilfield services companies could charge for their services.\nPrices for oil and natural gas historically have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile. During the past four years, the posted West Texas Intermediate (\u201cWTI\u201d) price for oil has ranged from a low of $26.21 per barrel (\u201cBbl\u201d) in February 2016 to a high of $107.26 per Bbl in June 2014. During 2016, WTI prices ranged from $26.21 to $54.06 per Bbl and during 2017, WTI prices ranged from $42.48 to $57.21 per Bbl. As of the first week of March 2018, WTI prices were around $62 per Bbl. If the prices of oil and natural gas continue to be volatile, reverse their recent increases, or decline, our operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely affected by uncertainty in the global financial markets and the deterioration of the financial condition of E&P companies.\nOur future results may be impacted by the uncertainty caused by an economic downturn, volatility or deterioration in the debt and equity capital markets, inflation, deflation or other adverse economic conditions that may negatively affect us or parties with whom we do business resulting in a reduction in our customers\u2019 spending and their non-payment or inability to perform obligations owed to us, such as the failure of customers to honor their commitments or the failure of major suppliers to complete orders. Additionally, during times when the natural gas or crude oil markets weaken, E&P companies are more likely to experience financial difficulties, including being unable to access debt or equity financing, which could result in a reduction in spending for our services. In addition, in the course of our business we hold accounts receivable from our customers. In the event of the financial distress or bankruptcy of a customer, we could lose all or a portion of such outstanding accounts receivable associated with that customer. Further, if a customer was to enter into bankruptcy, it could also result in the cancellation of all or a portion of our service contracts with such customer at significant expense or loss of expected revenues to us.\nOur operations are subject to inherent risks, some of which are beyond our control. These risks may be self-insured, or may not be fully covered under our insurance policies.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, such as, but not limited to, accidents, blowouts, explosions, craterings, fires, oil spills and releases of hydraulic fracturing fluids or wastewater into the environment. These conditions can cause:\n\u25cf disruption in operations;\n\u25cf substantial repair or remediation costs;\n\u25cf personal injury or loss of human life;\n\u25cf significant damage to or destruction of property and equipment;\n\u25cf environmental pollution, including groundwater contamination;\n\u25cf unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures and industrial accidents;\n\u25cf impairment or suspension of operations; and\n\u25cf substantial revenue loss.\nIn addition, our operations are subject to, and exposed to, employee/employer liabilities and risks such as wrongful termination, discrimination, labor organizing, retaliation claims and general human resource related matters.\nThe occurrence of a significant event or adverse claim in excess of the insurance coverage that we maintain or that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, combined results of operations and combined financial condition. Claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in the oilfield services industry. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence at a location where our equipment and services are being used may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.\nWe do not have insurance against all foreseeable risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs. The occurrence of an event not fully insured against or the failure of an insurer to meet its insurance obligations could result in substantial losses. In addition, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. Insurance may not be available to cover any or all of the risks to which we are subject, or, even if available, it may be inadequate, or insurance premiums or other costs could rise significantly in the future so as to make such insurance prohibitively expensive\nWe have a limited operating history and are subject to the substantial risks inherent in the growth and development of a relatively new business enterprise.\nWe have a limited operating history and, accordingly, we are subject to substantial risks inherent in the growth and development of a relatively new business enterprise. We have been operating an oilfield services business in Argentina since December 2014, with 2015 as our first full year of operations in that country. We commenced our oilfield services operations in the United States in the second quarter of 2017, with our first U.S. spread commencing operations in May 2017 and our second U.S. spread commencing operations October 2017. Although the amount of revenue generated from our operations increased significantly in 2017 as compared to prior periods, we have sustained operating losses in each of the past three years and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to grow our revenues or attain operating profitability.\nIn addition, we have a very limited business history that investors can analyze to aid them in making an informed judgment as to the merits of an investment in our company. Any investment in our company should be considered a high-risk investment because the investor will be placing funds at risk in our company with unforeseen costs, expenses, competition, operational challenges, and other problems to which new ventures are often subjected. Investors should not invest in our company unless they can afford to lose their entire investment. As we are relatively early in the revenue-generation process, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties encountered in the establishment, growth and development of a new business in a highly competitive industry.\nWe may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a relatively new business enterprise, growth in accordance with our business plan, if achieved, could place a significant strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. As we expand the scope of our activities and our geographic coverage through either organic growth or acquisitions, there will be additional demands on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrences of unexpected expansion difficulties, including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers, engineers and other professionals in the oilfield services industry, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to successfully or timely execute our business plan. We do not have highly sophisticated systems to forecast our future revenue or profitability and therefore could experience difficulty in managing our growth and associated working capital needs.\nIf our intended expansion of our business is not successful, our financial condition, profitability and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may not achieve increases in revenue and profitability that we hope to realize.\nA key element of our business strategy involves the expansion of our services, geographic presence and customer base. These aspects of our strategy are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf an inability to retain or hire experienced crews and other personnel;\n\u25cf a lack of customer demand for the services we intend to provide;\n\u25cf an inability to secure necessary equipment, raw materials (particularly sand and other proppants) or technology to successfully execute our expansion plans;\n\u25cf shortages of water used in our hydraulic fracturing operations;\n\u25cf unanticipated delays that could limit or defer the provision of services by us and jeopardize our relationships with existing customers and adversely affect our ability to obtain new customers for such services; and\n\u25cf competition from new and existing services providers.\nEncountering any of these or any unforeseen problems in implementing our planned expansion could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and could prevent us from achieving the increases in revenues and profitability that we hope to realize.\nWe participate in a capital-intensive industry and have limited sources of liquidity. Accordingly, we may have capital needs for which our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity may not be adequate.\nThe oil and gas industry is capital intensive. We have substantial future capital requirements, including the need to fund growth through acquisition of additional equipment and assets, working capital and capital expenditures and any future debt service obligations. Since December 2013, our operations and growth have been funded primarily by proceeds from various equity and debt offerings and more recently by cash flows from operations. Our ability to fund future operations and our planned capital expenditures will depend upon our future operating performance and, more broadly, on the availability and terms of equity and debt financing since we have limited internal sources of liquidity. The availability and terms of financing will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, market conditions in the exploration and production industry, and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain additional capital on favorable terms or at all, we may be unable to continue growing our business or to sustain or increase our current level of profitability. Our inability to grow our business may adversely impact our ability to generate profits. Moreover, if we cannot generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise secure sufficient liquidity to support our capital requirements, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity.\nOur liquidity needs and indebtedness, and any indebtedness we may incur in the future, could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nAny indebtedness, whether incurred in connection with acquisitions, operations or otherwise, may adversely affect our operations and limit our growth. In addition, our obligations under our Recourse Receivables Purchase & Security Agreement with Porter Capital Corporation (the \u201cReceivables Agreement\u201d) are secured by liens on certain of our assets, including our accounts receivable, chattel paper, inventory and substantially all of our equipment for our U.S. operations (excluding equipment subject to vendor financing). If our obligations under the Receivables Agreement are accelerated pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds to repay such obligations and our other obligations arising under our indebtedness or other obligations.\nOur level of indebtedness may affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u25cf increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf the covenants that are contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness could limit our ability to borrow funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n\u25cf our debt covenants could also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry;\n\u25cf any failure to comply with the financial or other covenants of our debt, including covenants that impose requirements to maintain certain financial ratios, could result in an event of default, which could result in some or all of our indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u25cf our level of debt could impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; and\n\u25cf our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to meet our obligations under our indebtedness, and we may have difficulty making debt service payments on such indebtedness as payments become due.\nOur customer base is concentrated, and the loss of one or more of our significant customers could cause our revenues to decline substantially and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur customer base in both the United States and Argentina is concentrated. We commenced our operations in Argentina in December 2014 and our operations in the U.S. in May 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our first two U.S. customers accounted for approximately 99% of our total U.S. revenue. In November 2017, we negotiated an early release of our first U.S. spread from our contract with our first U.S. customer and we are redeploying that spread to serve other customers; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully redeploy this spread at attractive utilization or pricing levels or within a short period of time. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our largest customer in Argentina accounted for approximately 44% of our total revenue and approximately 99% of the revenue generated from our operations in Argentina.\nWe will likely continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers in the future. If a significant customer fails to pay us, our revenue would be adversely impacted and our operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed. Additionally, if we were to lose a major customer, we may not be able to redeploy our equipment at similar utilization or pricing levels or within a short period of time and such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business until the equipment is redeployed at similar utilization or pricing levels. In addition, contracts with our existing customers may contain provisions whereby the customers may terminate the agreement in the event we are unable to perform under the terms of the contract or make adjustments to service and/or materials fees payable thereunder based on changing market conditions. Our customer contracts are also subject to termination by customers under certain circumstances, and any such termination could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have incurred losses to date under our service contract with our largest customer in Argentina. If our efforts to renegotiate the terms of our existing contract and enter into a new agreement with more favorable terms are unsuccessful, we may continue to incur losses under the contract. Also, if our negotiations are unsuccessful and we are unable to reach agreement with our customer, we may be released from the contract. If we receive an early release from the contract, our operations in Argentina may continue to incur losses, which could be substantial, until we are able to obtain new work from other customers. In addition, we may determine to reduce the scale of, shut down, or sell our operations in Argentina, which could result in the incurrence of material losses and expenses.\nIn the second quarter of 2017, we entered into a two-year contract with the largest operator in Argentina to provide services for their tight gas completions program. To date, we have incurred losses under the contract due to lower than expected utilization of our assets, higher than expected third party costs incurred in order to provide the bundled services contemplated under the contract, and other factors. We have been engaged in extensive negotiations with our customer to seek modifications to the contract that would provide us with more favorable operating results. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts to renegotiate the terms of the contract will be successful, and we may continue to incur losses under the contract in the future. Our negotiations with our customer may also result in an early release from our obligations under the contract. If we receive an early release from the contract, we may incur further losses associated with our Argentina operations, which could be substantial, while we transition to new customers, and there can be no assurance that we obtain contracts with new customers on favorable terms. In addition, there can be no assurance that our negotiations will result in either modifications to the contract or a release from the contract prior to the end of its current term. In addition, our Argentina operations may require access to additional capital if we continue to incur losses under our existing contract or during any transition period from our current customer to work for new customers following an early release from our current contract, which could involve the incurrence of indebtedness, cash contributions to our Argentinian subsidiary from our parent company, or third-party financing. We may also incur other material costs in connection with our efforts to renegotiate or exit our current contract. In addition, we may determine to reduce the scale of, shut down, or sell our operations in Argentina, which could result in the incurrence of material losses and expenses.\nWe may not be able to fulfill, renew or replace our existing agreements on attractive terms or at all, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully fulfill, renew or replace our existing agreements with new agreements on or prior to their expiration on terms satisfactory to us or the customer or that we will be able to continue to provide services under those existing agreements without service interruption. We are dependent on entering into additional service agreements to grow our business. If we are not able to either renew or enter into additional service agreements, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, many of whose operations are concentrated solely in the exploration and production industry which, as described above, is subject to volatility and, therefore, credit risk. Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully reduce customer credit risk. If we are unable to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness, any resulting increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by them and our inability to re-market or otherwise use our equipment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to maintain or improve pricing on our core services.\nPressures stemming from fluctuating market conditions and oil and natural gas prices may make it difficult to maintain or improve the pricing for our services. We have faced in the past, and may continue to face in the future, reductions in demand for our services as well as pricing pressure from the competitors who are also competing for those same opportunities. If we are unable to maintain or improve pricing on our core services, our financial results will be negatively impacted.\nOur customers may choose to integrate their operations vertically by purchasing and operating their own well stimulation fleet, expanding the amount of well stimulation equipment they currently own or using alternative technologies for enhancing oil and gas production.\nOur customers may choose to integrate their operations vertically by purchasing and operating their own well stimulation fleets in lieu of using our well stimulation services. In addition, there are other technologies available for the artificial enhancement of oil and natural gas production and our customers may elect to use these alternative technologies instead of the well stimulation services we provide. Vertical integration increases or use of alternative technologies could result in decreased demand for our well stimulation services, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur assets require significant amounts of capital for maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment and we may require significant capital expenditures for additional equipment.\nOur pressure pumping and other related equipment requires significant capital investment for maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment to maintain their competitiveness. The costs of components and labor have increased in the past and may increase in the future with increases in demand, which will require us to incur additional costs to maintain our current equipment or upgrade and maintain any spreads we may acquire in the future. Our spreads and other equipment typically do not generate revenue while they are undergoing maintenance, upgrades or refurbishment. Any maintenance, upgrade or refurbishment project for our assets could increase our indebtedness or reduce cash available for other opportunities. Furthermore, such projects may require proportionally greater capital investments as a percentage of total asset value, which may make such projects difficult to finance on acceptable terms. To the extent we are unable to fund such projects, we may have less equipment available for service or our equipment may not be attractive to potential or current customers. Additionally, competition or advances in technology within our industry may require us to update or replace existing spreads or build or acquire new spreads. Such demands on our capital or reductions in demand for our pressure pumping services and the increase in cost of labor necessary for such maintenance and improvement, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nWe rely on a limited number of third parties for sand, proppant and chemicals, and delays in deliveries of such materials, increases in the cost of such materials or our contractual obligations to pay for materials that we ultimately do not require could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have established relationships with a limited number of suppliers of our raw materials (such as guar gum, sand, proppant and chemicals). Should any of our current suppliers be unable to provide the necessary materials or otherwise fail to deliver the materials in a timely manner and in the quantities required, any resulting delays in the provision of services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, increasing costs of such materials may negatively impact demand for our services or the profitability of our operations. In the past, our industry has faced sporadic proppant shortages associated with hydraulic fracturing operations requiring work stoppages, which has adversely impacted the operating results of some of our competitors. We may not be able to mitigate any future shortages of materials, including proppant. Furthermore, to the extent our contracts require us to purchase more materials, including proppant, than we ultimately require, we may be forced to pay for the excess amount under \u201ctake or pay\u201d contract provisions.\nOur ability to operate successfully depends on the availability of water.\nWell stimulation, and pressure pumping more generally, can require a significant supply of water, and water supply and quality are important requirements to our operations. We expect the water requirements necessary for us to conduct our operations will be obtained from sources on or near the well sites, but there is no assurance that there will be a sufficient supply of water from sources in these areas, some of which are prone to drought. For example, in December 2016, the Neuqu\u00e9n province in Argentina declared a 12-month state of emergency as a result of a severe drought. In response to this emergency, the Governor of Neuqu\u00e9n also established a special committee with broad powers to take any \u201curgent and immediate action deemed necessary to address the water emergency.\u201d While we cannot predict what measures may be taken in response to drought conditions, limitations on water use or increased costs to obtain water from alternative sources has the potential to adversely affect our operations, financial position, and results of operations.\nFederal or state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to induced seismicity could result in operating restrictions or delays in the drilling and completion of oil and natural gas wells that may reduce demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur E&P company customers dispose of flowback and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids gathered from oil and natural gas E&P operations in accordance with permits issued by government authorities overseeing such disposal activities. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change based on concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities. One such concern relates to recent seismic events near underground disposal wells that are used for the disposal by injection of flowback and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids resulting from oil and natural gas activities. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. Developing research suggests that the link between seismic activity and wastewater disposal may vary by region, and that only a very small fraction of the tens of thousands of injection wells have been suspected to be, or may have been, the likely cause of induced seismicity. In March 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arkansas. In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Oklahoma issued rules for wastewater disposal wells that imposed certain permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults and also, from time to time, is developing and implementing plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. The Texas Railroad Commission adopted similar rules. More recently, in December 2016, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission\u2019s (\u201cOCC\u201d) Oil and Gas Conservation Division and the Oklahoma Geological Survey released well completion seismicity guidance, which requires operators to take certain prescriptive actions, including an operator\u2019s planned mitigation practices, following certain unusual seismic activity within 1.25 miles of hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition, in February 2017, the OCC\u2019s Oil and Gas Conservation Division issued an order limiting future increases in the volume of oil and natural gas wastewater injected below ground into the Arbuckle formation in an effort to reduce the number of earthquakes in the state and imposed further reductions in the Edmond area in August 2017. Another consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal.\nThese developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells by our customers to dispose of flowback and produced water and certain other oilfield fluids. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity also could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for waste disposal. Any one or more of these developments may result in our customers having to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates or locations, or require our customers or third party disposal well operators that are used to dispose of customers\u2019 wastewater to shut down disposal wells, which developments could adversely affect our customers\u2019 business and result in a corresponding decrease in the need for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to provide services that meet the specific needs of oil and natural gas E&P companies at competitive prices.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and have relatively few barriers to entry, and the competitive environment has intensified as recent mergers among E&P companies have reduced the number of available customers. The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate are product and service quality and availability, responsiveness, experience, technology, equipment quality, reputation for safety and price. We compete with small companies capable of competing effectively in our markets on a local basis. We also compete with large national and multi-national companies that have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do. Our initial well stimulation fleet in Argentina currently does not have sufficient HHP to enable us to participate in unconventional or larger well stimulation jobs. See Part I - Item 1 - \u201cBusiness-Markets.\u201d\nThe inability to control the inherent risks of acquiring and integrating businesses in the future could adversely affect our operations.\nAs a part of our business strategy, we intend to pursue selected acquisitions or mergers. If we choose to grow our business through acquisitions or mergers, it is possible that companies acquired or merged into our company may have associated risks including:\n\u25cf Unanticipated costs and assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities;\n\u25cf Inherent difficulties in integrating the operations and assets of the acquired business and personnel;\n\u25cf Potential losses of key employees and customers of the acquired business;\n\u25cf Internal control weaknesses or limitations on our ability to properly assess and maintain an effective internal control environment over an acquired business, in order to comply with public reporting requirements;\n\u25cf Risks of entering markets in which we have limited prior experience; and\n\u25cf Increases in our expenses and working capital requirements.\nUnexpected equipment malfunctions, catastrophic events and scheduled maintenance may lead to decreased revenue and reduce our cash flows.\nOur performance is primarily dependent upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our pressure pumping fleets and, to a lesser extent, the functionality of our coiled tubing unit in Argentina. If our operation of such core equipment experiences unanticipated disruption due to an accident, mechanical failure, shortage of spare parts or other unforeseen event such as a fire, explosion, violent weather conditions or unexpected operational difficulties, or if we have to schedule a temporary shutdown to perform maintenance on any of our core equipment, our ability to provide timely services to our customers could be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be successful in implementing technology development and enhancements.\nThe market for our services and products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more reliable performance and services. If we are not able to provide commercially competitive services in a timely manner in response to changes in technology, our business and revenues could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if our technologies, equipment, or work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive and our business and revenues could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on the services of key executives, the loss of whom could materially harm our business.\nThe management of our Company is important to our success because they are instrumental in setting our strategic direction, operating the business, identifying, recruiting and training key personnel, and identifying expansion opportunities. Losing the services of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement could be found. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our management. As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees.\nWe may be unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled and qualified workers.\nThe delivery of our services requires personnel with specialized skills and experience who can perform physically demanding work. As a result of the volatility of the oilfield service industry and the demanding nature of the work, workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive. The demand for skilled workers is high and the supply is limited.\nWe may be adversely impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters.\nThe petroleum and oil-service industries in Argentina, where we operate, and certain other countries are unionized, and it is likely that we may experience work stoppages or other labor disruptions from time to time. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 90% of our Argentine employees were represented by unions and they are working under the conditions stated in their collective bargaining agreements. No assurance can be given that the collective bargaining agreements will be successfully extended or renegotiated as they expire from time to time. If any collective bargaining agreement is not extended or renegotiated, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, we could experience a significant disruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations or incur higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our combined results of operations and financial condition by disrupting our ability to perform well stimulation or pressure pumping and other services for the customers under our service contracts. In addition, although none of our U.S. employees are currently represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements, there can be no assurance that will be the case in the future or that we will not encounter work stoppages or labor disruptions in the U.S. market.\nIf we become subject to warranty, similar claims or litigation, it could be time-consuming and costly to defend.\nErrors, defects or other performance problems in the products that we sell or services that we offer could result in our customers seeking damages from us for losses associated with these errors, defects or other performance problems.\nOur business involves certain operating risks and our insurance coverage or proceeds, if any, may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we might incur in our operations.\nThe technical complexities of our operations are such that we are exposed to a wide range of significant worker health, safety and environmental risks. Our services involve production-related activities, radioactive materials, explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration, development and production environments. An accident involving our services or equipment, or a failure of a product, could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment, or suspension of operations. Our insurance policies may not protect us against liability for some kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nGeopolitical and terrorism risks continue to grow in a number of countries, including those where we do business. Geopolitical and terrorism risks could lead to, among other things, a loss of our investment in the country, impairment of the safety of our employees and impairment of our ability to conduct our operations.\nRecently enacted changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRecently enacted legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, made significant changes to the U.S. federal income taxation of business entities. These changes include a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate. Such rate reduction, however, could be offset by other changes intended to broaden the tax base, including (i) imposing new limitations on the utilization of net operating losses, (ii) limiting the deductibility of interest expense, and (iii) eliminating the deduction for certain domestic production activities. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is highly complex and subject to interpretation. We continue to examine the impact the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may have on us, and it could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $84.0 million of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d), which begin to expire in 2018. Utilization of these NOLs depends on many factors, including our future income, which cannot be assured. In addition, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOLs that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an \u201cownership change\u201d (as determined under Section 382). An ownership change generally occurs if one or more shareholders (or groups of shareholders) who are each deemed to own at least 5% of our stock change their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. In the event that an ownership change has occurred, or were to occur, utilization of our NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382, determined by multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate as defined in Section 382, subject to certain adjustments. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years. We may have previously experienced and may in the future experience one or more \u201cownership changes.\u201d As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. We believe that the the Fir Tree transaction (noted in Part III - Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Transactions with Fir Tree) may constitute a change in control, which could impact our ability to utilize our NOLs; however, we have not yet fully evaluated the impact this transaction will have on us. Furthermore, as discussed above, we continue to examine the impact the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may have on us with respect to our ability to utilize our NOLs as well as the value of our NOLs to us as a result of the decrease in corporate income tax rates. See \u201cRecently enacted changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Operations in Argentina and Other Foreign Jurisdictions\nOur business may be impacted by economic conditions in Argentina.\nOur business may be impacted by economic conditions prevailing in Argentina. The Argentine economy has experienced significant volatility in past decades, including numerous periods of low or negative growth and high and variable levels of inflation and devaluation. If economic conditions in Argentina contract, or if the Argentine government\u2019s measures to attract or retain foreign investment and international financing in the future are unsuccessful, such developments could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nArgentine economic conditions are dependent on a variety of factors, including (but not limited to) the following:\n\u25cf international demand for Argentina\u2019s principal exports;\n\u25cf international prices for Argentina\u2019s principal commodity exports;\n\u25cf stability and competitiveness of the Argentine Peso against foreign currencies;\n\u25cf levels of consumer consumption and foreign and domestic investment and financing; and\n\u25cf the rate of inflation.\nIn recent years, Argentina has confronted inflationary pressure. Increased rates of inflation in Argentina could increase our cost of operation and may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that inflation rates will not be higher in the future.\nIn addition, Argentina\u2019s economy is vulnerable to adverse developments affecting its principal trading partners. A significant decline in the economic growth of any of Argentina\u2019s major trading partners, such as Brazil, China or the U.S., could have a material adverse impact on Argentina\u2019s balance of trade and adversely affect Argentina\u2019s economic growth and may consequently adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Argentine Peso has been subject to significant devaluation in the past and may be subject to significant fluctuations in the future, consequently affecting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows (see additionally Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - \u201cWe may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\u201d)\nThe Argentinian government has fixed oil and gas prices for domestic producers. Any decrease or removal of the fixed price could result in a corresponding reduction in drilling activity in Argentina, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Argentinian government has historically fixed the price of oil and natural gas. More recently, the government has been supportive of fixed prices for natural gas but has indicated a desire to allow the oil prices to adjust to international prices. We have no assurance that the government will not lower the fixed prices for oil or natural gas in the future or remove them altogether. If the fixed price for oil or natural gas were to be reduced or removed, there may be less drilling activity in Argentina, which could have a corresponding adverse effect on the demand for our products or services.\nCertain risks are inherent in any investment in a company operating in an emerging market such as Argentina.\nArgentina is an emerging market economy and investing in emerging markets generally carries risks. These risks include political, social and economic instability that may affect Argentina\u2019s economic results which can stem from many factors, including the following:\n\u25cf high interest rates;\n\u25cf abrupt changes in currency values;\n\u25cf high levels of inflation;\n\u25cf exchange controls;\n\u25cf wage and price controls;\n\u25cf regulations to import equipment and other necessities relevant for operations;\n\u25cf changes in governmental economic or tax policies; and\n\u25cf political and social tensions.\nAny of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nThe Argentine economy has been adversely affected by economic developments in other markets.\nFinancial and securities markets in Argentina, and the Argentine economy, are influenced by economic and market conditions in other markets worldwide. Considering the current international turmoil, Argentina\u2019s economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including those relating to or similar to the global economic crisis that began in 2008 and the more recent uncertainties surrounding European sovereign debt. Although economic conditions vary from country to country, investors\u2019 perceptions of events occurring in one country may substantially affect capital flows into and investments in securities from issuers in other countries, including Argentina.\nConsequently, there can be no assurance that the Argentine financial system and securities markets will not continue to be adversely affected by events in developed countries\u2019 economies or events in other emerging markets, which could in turn adversely affect the Argentine economy and, as a consequence, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe implementation of new export duties, other taxes and import regulations could adversely affect our results.\nChanges in export duties, taxes and import regulations may negatively affect our business, financial condition and cash flows. For example, in 2012, the Argentine government adopted an import procedure pursuant to which local authorities must pre-approve any import of products and services to Argentina as a precondition to allow importers access to the foreign exchange market for the payment of such imported products and services. We cannot assure you that these taxes and import regulations will not continue or be increased in the future or that other new taxes or import regulations will not be imposed.\nWe may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nOur results of operations are exposed to currency fluctuation and any devaluation of the Argentine Peso against the U.S. dollar and other hard currencies may adversely affect our business and results of operations. The value of the Argentine Peso has fluctuated significantly in the past and may do so in the future. We are unable to predict whether, and to what extent, the value of the Argentine Peso may further depreciate or appreciate against the U.S. dollar and how any such fluctuations would affect our business.\nWe are subject to exchange and capital controls.\nIn the past, Argentina imposed exchange controls and transfer restrictions substantially limiting the ability of companies to retain foreign currency or make payments abroad. Although the Macri government lifted exchange controls and liberalized capital controls as described above, there can be no assurances regarding future modifications to exchange and capital controls. Exchange and capital controls could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and our ability to meet our foreign currency obligations and execute our financing plans.\nOperating internationally subjects us to significant risks and regulations inherent in operating in foreign countries.\nWe may conduct operations in a number of countries as part of our growth strategy. Our international operations will be subject to a number of risks inherent to any business operating in foreign countries, and especially those with emerging markets, including the following risks, among others:\n\u25cf government instability, which can cause investment in capital projects by our potential customers to be withdrawn or delayed, reducing or eliminating the viability of some markets for our services;\n\u25cf potential expropriation, seizure, nationalization or detention of assets, such as the 2012 nationalization of Repsol S.A.\u2019s interest in YPF;\n\u25cf difficulty in repatriating foreign currency received in excess of local currency requirements;\n\u25cf foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, import/export tariffs and quotas;\n\u25cf civil uprisings, riots and war, which can make it unsafe to continue operations, adversely affect both budgets and schedules and expose us to losses;\n\u25cf availability of suitable personnel and equipment, which can be affected by government policy, or changes in policy that limit the importation of qualified crewmembers or specialized equipment in areas where local resources are insufficient;\n\u25cf decrees, laws, regulations, interpretation and court decisions under legal systems, which are not always fully developed and which may be retroactively applied and cause us to incur unanticipated and/or unrecoverable costs as well as delays which may result in real or opportunity costs; and\n\u25cf terrorist attacks, including kidnappings of our personnel.\nWe cannot predict the nature and the likelihood of any such events. However, if any of these or other similar events should occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flow.\nCertain of the equipment that we use in certain foreign countries may require prior U.S. government approval in the form of an export license and may otherwise be subject to tariffs and import/export restrictions. The delay in obtaining required governmental approvals could affect our ability to timely commence a project, and the failure to comply with all such controls could result in fines and other penalties.\nWe may be subject to taxation in many foreign jurisdictions and the final determination of our tax liabilities involves the interpretation of the statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide. Our tax returns will be subject to routine examination by taxing authorities, and these examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes, penalties and/or interest.\nOur overall success as an international company may depend, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing economic, social and political conditions. We may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business, which could negatively affect our profitability.\nOur international operations involve the use of foreign currencies, which subjects us to exchange rate fluctuations, difficulty in repatriating foreign currencies and other currency risks.\nWe and our foreign subsidiaries from time to time will hold foreign currencies. Exchange rate fluctuations will subject us to currency risk as well as to other risks sometimes associated with international operations. In the future, we could experience fluctuations in financial results from our operations outside the U.S., and there can be no assurance that payments received in foreign currencies can be repatriated to the U.S. or that we will be able, contractually or otherwise, to reduce the currency risks associated with our international operations. In addition, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act imposes one-time taxation on offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated. The overall impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is uncertain, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-bribery laws.\nThe United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making, offering or authorizing improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We do business and may do additional business in the future in countries or regions where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices.\nAs a company subject to compliance with the FCPA, our business may suffer and we may be subject to competitive disadvantages because our efforts to comply with U.S. laws could restrict our ability to do business in foreign markets relative to our competitors who are not subject to U.S. law. Additionally, our business plan involves establishing close relationships with stakeholders in certain foreign markets. Any determination that we or foreign shareholders, directors or officer\u2019s partners have violated the FCPA may adversely affect our business and operations.\nViolations of anti-bribery laws (either due to our acts or our inadvertence) may result in criminal and civil sanctions and could subject us to other liabilities in the U.S. and elsewhere. Even allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\nWe may face intense competition in our industry and in the markets where we operate.\nThe industry in which we compete is highly competitive, and most of our potential competitors will have greater financial resources than we do. Our ability to renew or replace existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain or improve current revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors and our customers. If our competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to the development and marketing of competitive services or substantially decrease the prices at which they offer their services, we may be unable to compete effectively. Some of these competitors may expand or construct newer, more powerful or more flexible well stimulation fleets that would create additional competition for us. Furthermore, reductions in drilling activity in markets such as North America may drive other oilfield services companies to relocate their equipment to the regions outside the U.S. in which we operate or intend to operate. Such increase in supply relative to demand could negatively impact pricing and utilization of our services. All of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter markets served or proposed to be served by us, that we will be able to compete successfully, or that we will have adequate funds to compete.\nRegulatory compliance costs and restrictions, as well as delays in obtaining permits by the customers for their operations, such as for well stimulation and pressure pumping, or by us for our operations, could impair our business.\nOur operations and the operations of our customers are subject to or impacted by a wide array of regulations in the jurisdictions in which our and their operations are located. As a result of changes in regulations and laws relating to the oil and natural gas industry, including well stimulation, our operations or the operations of our customers could be disrupted or curtailed by governmental authorities. The high cost of compliance with applicable regulations may cause customers to discontinue or limit their operations, and may discourage companies from continuing development activities. As a result, demand for our services could be substantially affected by regulations adversely impacting the oil and natural gas industry.\nOur operations are subject to hazards and environmental risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry.\nWe are a provider of well stimulation and pressure pumping services, a process involving the injection of fluids-typically consisting mostly of water and also including several chemical additives-as well as sand in order to create fractures extending from the well bore through the rock formation to enable oil or natural gas to move more easily through the rock pores to a production well. In addition, we provide a range of services to onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production operations, consisting of, among other things, coiled tubing services. Risks inherent to our industry create the potential for significant losses associated with damage to the environment or natural resources, such as the potential for contamination of drinking water resources.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental, worker health and safety laws and regulations that may subject us to substantial liability or require us to take actions that will adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is significantly affected by stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety matters. The cost of compliance with these laws can be significant. Failure to properly handle, transport or dispose of these materials or otherwise conduct our operations in accordance with these and other environmental laws could expose us to substantial liability for administrative, civil and criminal penalties, cleanup and site restoration costs and liability associated with releases of such materials, damages to natural resources and other damages, as well as potentially impair our ability to conduct our operations. We could be exposed to liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages and other damages under these and other environmental laws. Such liability can be on a strict, joint and several liability basis, without regard to fault. Liability may be imposed as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Environmental laws and regulations have changed in the past, and they are likely to change in the future. If existing environmental requirements or enforcement policies change and become more stringent, we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures.\nThe adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for oil and natural gas.\nIn recent years, many national, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. For example, in the United States, the EPA has finalized a series of greenhouse gas monitoring, reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions including carbon dioxide and methane. In December 2015, the United States and Argentina participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake \u201cambitious efforts\u201d to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases. The Agreement, which went into effect in November 2016, establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department officially informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States\u2019 adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. In addition, we cannot predict what additional steps, if any, Argentina may take as a result of participation in the Paris Agreement. Argentina has also passed a number of energy-efficiency related measures as well as requirements for the blending of ethanol and other biofuels with petroleum fuels. These measures could reduce demands for petroleum products, which in turn could have an adverse impact on demand for our services.\nMoreover, climate change may cause more extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our services and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather. At this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.\nNew technology may cause us to become less competitive.\nThe oilfield services industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling and completion techniques and services using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent protection. If competitors and others use or develop new technologies in the future that are more efficient or productive than ours, we may lose market share or be placed at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe industry is affected by excess equipment inventory levels.\nBecause of the long-life nature of oilfield service equipment and the lag between when a decision to build additional equipment is made and when the equipment is placed into service, the inventory of oilfield service equipment in the industry does not always correlate with the level of demand for service equipment.\nCompliance with governmental regulations may impact our or our customers\u2019 operations and may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur operations are dependent on our customers\u2019 decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves and on the regulatory environment in which our customers and we operate. The ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed, as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells. Advanced technologies, such as horizontal drilling and well stimulation and pressure pumping, improve total recovery, but they also result in a more rapid production decline and may become subject to more stringent regulations in the future.\nAccess to prospects is also important to our customers and such access may be limited because host governments do not allow access to the reserves or because another oil and natural gas exploration company owns the rights to develop the prospect. Government regulations and the costs incurred by oil and natural gas exploration companies to conform to and comply with government regulations may also limit the quantity of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced. This could lead our customers to curtail their operations and result in a decrease in demand for our services, which in turn could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nAny of these factors could affect the supply of oil and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives relating to well stimulation could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays for our operations or the operations of our customers.\nMany national, provincial, and local governments and agencies have adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using well stimulation, which is part of the overall services we provide to our customers. Well stimulation is a treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs. Specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated, causing cracks in the target formation. Proppant, such as sand of a particular size, is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the cracks open when the treatment is complete. In response to concerns related to potential impacts to the environment and natural resources from well stimulation, governmental authorities have issued new rules and regulations governing the practice and are also pursuing studies related to its potential effects. Also, some national, state, and local governments have adopted bans or other measures restricting well stimulation activities. For example, the Province of Neuqu\u00e9n in Argentina, where we operate, has approved a set of rules regarding the extraction of shale oil and gas. These rules require, amongst other things, that operators performing well stimulation obtain permits prior to commencing drilling activities and file reports with the provincial government regarding the chemicals used in the well stimulation process and an analysis of the flowback water returning to the surface. In certain regions, the indigenous people have voiced their opposition to the increased shale development although to date these protests have been peaceful and have yet to disrupt activity in a meaningful way. In addition, several other provinces and local governments have voted to ban well stimulation within their borders, and some groups continue to advocate for a national ban on well stimulation in Argentina. The EPA and states, including Oklahoma, have also taken steps to regulate hydraulic fracturing. There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, induced seismic activity, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. Legislative or regulatory changes could cause us or our customers to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential national, state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing.\nFuture well stimulation-related legislation or regulations that further restrict or prohibit such activities could lead to operational delays and increased costs for our operations or the operations of our customers. Any adverse impacts on the operations of our customers could in turn reduce demand for our services. If such additional legislation or regulations are enacted and implemented, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, increased costs and risks as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with most, but not all, of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d), as well as rules and regulations implemented by the SEC. Changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of SOX and rules adopted by the SEC, have resulted in, and will continue to result in, increased costs to us as we respond to these requirements. Given the risks inherent in the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting is uncertain. If our internal controls are not designed or operating effectively, we may not be able to issue an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as required. Investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and which could affect our ability to run our business as we otherwise would like to. New rules could also make it more difficult or costlier for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the coverage that is the same or similar to our current coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board, the committees of our Board, and as executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the total amount of the costs we may incur or the timing of such costs to comply with these rules and regulations.\nCompliance with SOX requirements will continue to strain our limited financial and management resources.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses in connection with our status as a reporting public company. SOX and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC have imposed various requirements on public companies, including corporate governance practices. As such, our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time-consuming and costly. In addition, SOX requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure of controls and procedures. Our testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. Our compliance with Section 404 of SOX requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and therefore only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to our stockholders.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, capital requirements, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our Board. In addition, the terms of our existing indebtedness and any indebtedness we may incur in the future may restrict our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may not occur, is expected to provide a return to our stockholders.\nWe currently have a sporadic, illiquid, volatile market for our common stock, and the market for our common stock may remain sporadic, illiquid, and volatile in the future.\nWe currently have a highly sporadic, illiquid and volatile market for our common stock, which market is anticipated to remain sporadic, illiquid and volatile in the future and will likely be subject to wide fluctuations in response to several factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;\n\u25cf our ability or inability to generate revenues, profits or positive cash flow;\n\u25cf the number of shares in our public float;\n\u25cf increased competition; and\n\u25cf conditions and trends in the market for oil and natural gas and oilfield services.\nFurthermore, our stock price may be impacted by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. These market fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rates or international currency fluctuations, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Stockholders and potential investors in our common stock should exercise caution before making an investment in our Company and should not place undue reliance on the publicly quoted or traded stock prices in determining our common stock value.\nFir Tree may have significant influence over us, including influence over decisions that require stockholder approval, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Fir Tree beneficially owned approximately 67.1% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, Fir Tree currently has the right to nominate up to a total of three individuals to the Board. As a result, Fir Tree has influence over our decisions to take certain corporate actions including those specified in the Amended and Restated Stockholder Rights Agreement we have entered into with Fir Tree and certain other stockholders (the \u201cA&R Stockholder Rights Agreement\u201d).\nMoreover, Fir Tree has a contractual right to maintain its percentage ownership in our Company. Specifically, under the terms of the A&R Stockholder Rights Agreement, for so long as Fir Tree beneficially owns more than 10% of our issued and outstanding common stock (calculated on a fully diluted basis), Fir Tree, subject to certain exclusions, has a preemptive right to purchase up to the amount of any new securities we propose to issue or sell as is necessary to maintain Fir Tree\u2019s percentage ownership of us. As a result, Fir Tree\u2019s preemptive right will apply to any securities we issue during an underwritten public offering. Therefore, while other holders of our stock would risk suffering a reduction in percentage ownership in connection with a new issuance of securities by us, Fir Tree would, through this preemptive right, have the opportunity to avoid a reduction in percentage ownership. As long as Fir Tree continues to hold a significant portion of our outstanding common stock, it will have the ability to influence the vote in any election of directors and over decisions that require stockholder approval. Please read Part III - Item 13 - \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence.\u201d\nWe may issue preferred stock with terms that could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 15290, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "ESESQ"}
