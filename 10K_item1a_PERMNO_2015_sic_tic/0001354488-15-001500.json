RISK FACTORS\nThere are numerous factors that affect our business and operating results, many of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of significant factors that may cause our future operating results to differ materially from those currently expected. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not specified herein, not currently known to us, or currently deemed to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur operations are highly dependent on our relationships with Genesis and LEH, and, if we are unable to successfully maintain these relationships, our operations, liquidity and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe are party to a variety of contracts and agreements with Genesis and its affiliates that enable the purchase of crude oil and condensate, transportation of crude oil and condensate, and other services. Certain of these agreements with Genesis and its affiliates have an initial term of three years and successive one-year renewals until August 12, 2019 unless sooner terminated by Genesis or its affiliates with 180 days prior written notice. Further, we have an understanding with Genesis related to inventory risk management, which is intended to reduce the commodity price risk of our refined petroleum product inventories and generate a more consistent gross profit margin for each barrel of refined petroleum products.\nLEH manages our property and the property of our subsidiaries, including the Nixon Facility, in the ordinary course of business pursuant to the Operating Agreement. The Operating Agreement expires on the earliest to occur of: (a) the termination date of a certain agreement with a Genesis affiliate, which has an initial term of three years and successive one-year renewals until August 12, 2019 unless sooner terminated by the Genesis affiliate with 180 days prior written notice, (b) August 12, 2015, or (c) upon written notice of either party to the Operating Agreement of a material breach of the Operating Agreement by the other party.\nThese agreements and understandings require us to have a close working relationship with Genesis and LEH in order for us to be successful in fully executing our business strategy. If we are unable to maintain these relationships or our relationships are not on good terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe may have capital needs for which our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity may not be adequate.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise secure sufficient liquidity to support our short-term and long-term capital requirements, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations or pursue our business strategies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity. Our short-term working capital needs are related to repayment of debt obligations and capital expenditures for maintenance, upgrades, and refurbishment of equipment at the Nixon Facility. Our long-term working capital needs primarily relate to repayment of long-term debt obligations. In addition, we continue to utilize capital to reduce operational, safety and environmental risks. We may incur substantial compliance costs in connection with any new environmental, health and safety regulations. Our liquidity will affect our ability to satisfy any of these needs.\nOur ability to use NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cIRC Section 382\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Within the meaning of IRC Section 382, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs when the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% shareholders, applying certain look-through rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders' lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).\nAs of December 31, 2014, we reported a net deferred tax asset of approximately $5.7 million. Blue Dolphin experienced ownership changes in 2005 in connection with a series of private placements, and in 2012 as a result of the reverse acquisition of LE. The 2012 ownership change limits our ability to utilize NOLs following the 2005 ownership change that were not previously subject to limitation. Limitations imposed on our ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect, and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. NOLs generated after the 2012 ownership change are not subject to limitation.\nGenesis and LEH may, but are not required to, fund our working capital requirements in the event our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity are inadequate.\nHistorically, we have relied on Genesis and/or LEH to fund our working capital requirements when cash reserves and revenue from operations, including sales of refined petroleum products and rental of storage tanks, were insufficient to fund our working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, working capital requirements financed by LEH were $1,174,168 and $3,659,340, respectively, and are reflected in accounts payable, related party in our consolidated balance sheets. We expect that these resources will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated working capital requirements over the next 12 to 18 months. In the event our working capital requirements are not funded by Genesis and/or LEH, or we are otherwise unable to secure sufficient liquidity to support our short term and/or long-term capital requirements, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations, comply with certain deadlines related to environmental regulations and standards or pursue our business strategies, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity. Our long-term needs for cash include ongoing capital expenditures for equipment to improve the Nixon Facility and reduce operational, safety and environmental risks. Our liquidity will affect our ability to satisfy any of these needs.\nThe dangers inherent in oil and gas operations could expose us to potentially significant losses, costs or liabilities and reduce our liquidity.\nOil and gas operations are inherently subject to significant hazards and risks. These hazards and risks include, but are not limited to, fires, explosions, ruptures, blowouts, spills, third-party interference and equipment failure, any of which could result in interruption or termination of operations, pollution, personal injury and death, or damage to our assets and the property of others. These risks could harm our reputation and business, result in claims against us, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe geographic concentration of our assets creates a significant exposure to the risks of the regional economy and other regional adverse conditions.\nOur primary operating asset, the Nixon Facility, is located in Nixon, Wilson County, Texas in Texas\u2019 Eagle Ford Shale and we market our refined petroleum products in a single, relatively limited geographic area. In addition, our onshore facilities assets are located in Freeport, Brazoria County, Texas, and all of our pipelines and oil and gas properties are located within the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, our operations are more susceptible to regional economic conditions than our more geographically diversified competitors. Any changes in market conditions, unforeseen circumstances or other events affecting the area in which our assets are located could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These factors include, among other things, changes in the economy, weather conditions, demographics, and population.\nCompetition from companies having greater financial and other resources than we do could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe refining industry is highly competitive. Our refining operations compete with domestic refiners and marketers in PADD 3 (Gulf Coast), domestic refiners in other PADD regions, and foreign refiners that import products into the United States. Certain of our competitors have larger, more complex refineries and may be able to realize higher margins per barrel of production. Several of our principal competitors are integrated national or international oil companies that are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do and have access to proprietary sources of controlled crude oil production. Unlike these competitors, we obtain all of our feedstocks from a single supplier. Because of their integrated operations and larger capitalization, larger, more complex refineries may be more flexible in responding to volatile industry or market conditions, such as crude oil and other feedstocks supply shortages or commodity price fluctuations. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose existing customers or fail to acquire new customers.\nWe are subject to strict laws and regulations regarding personnel and process safety, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and profitability.\nWe are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers, and the proper design, operation and maintenance of our equipment. In addition, OSHA and certain environmental regulations require that we maintain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that we provide this information to personnel and state and local governmental authorities. Failure to comply with these requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring and control of occupational exposure to regulated substances, may result in significant fines or compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may incur significant liability under, or costs and capital expenditures to comply with, environmental, health and safety regulations, which are complex and change frequently.\nOur refinery, pipelines and other operations are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of petroleum and hazardous substances, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, characteristics and composition of diesel and other matters otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Our operations are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. Compliance with the complex array of federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety is difficult and likely will require us to make significant expenditures. Moreover, our business is inherently subject to accidental spills, discharges or other releases of petroleum or hazardous substances into the environment including at neighboring areas or third-party storage, treatment or disposal facilities. Certain environmental laws impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct in connection with the investigation and cleanup of such spills, discharges or releases. As such, we may be required to pay more than our fair share of such investigation or cleanup. We may not be able to operate in compliance with all applicable environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permits at all times. Violations of applicable legal or regulatory requirements could result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions, permit revocations, injunctions and/or facility shutdowns.\nWe may also be required to make significant capital expenditures, incur increased operating costs, or change operations to achieve compliance with applicable standards and regulations. For example:\n\u25cf\nWe review, on an ongoing basis, our compliance with relevant federal, state and local environmental laws. During the course of our review, we may discover that we are not in compliance with existing environmental regulations. To the extent that we are out of compliance, we may incur significant liabilities, costs and capital expenditures to comply with such environmental regulations, which are complex and change frequently. Costs of compliance are often unpredictable, and there can be no assurance that the future costs will not be material. It is possible that we may identify additional costs in the future, which could result in additional obligations and expenses, including fines and penalties;\n\u25cf\nOn September 12, 2012, the EPA published final amendments to NSPS for petroleum refineries to be effective November 13, 2012. These amendments include standards for emissions of nitrogen oxides from process heaters and work practice standards and monitoring requirements for flares. We continue to evaluate the regulation and amended standards, as may be applicable to the operations at our refinery. We cannot currently predict costs we may incur, if any, to comply with the amended NSPS, but the costs could be material; and\n\u25cf\nNew environmental regulations became effective in June 2014 that require most refineries to produce transportation-related fuels for highway and non-highway use at 15 ppm sulfur. In order to meet the lower sulfur content requirement for NRLM in the United States, the Nixon Facility will require capital upgrades in excess of approximately $50 million. In order to complete the required capital upgrades, we will have to finance such capital expenditures primarily through the issuance of debt and/or equity, which would result in dilution to existing stockholders and/or subject us to higher debt levels. The Nixon Facility can continue to sell diesel with high sulfur content in the United States to other refineries and blenders as a feedstock and to other countries as a finished petroleum product. There can be no assurance that we can: (i) obtain financing for capital expenditures at rates or at terms acceptable to us, if at all, (ii) sell diesel with a higher sulfur content in the United States to other refineries and blenders as feedstock or overseas as a finished petroleum product, or (iii) sell higher sulfur diesel content at prices that we deem reasonable or at all.\nCapital expenditures or costs for compliance with existing environmental, health and safety regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and profitability. We cannot predict the extent to which additional environmental, health and safety legislation or regulations will be enacted or become effective in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time.\nOur insurance policies may be inadequate or expensive.\nOur insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses, costs or liabilities. We could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of our existing insurance coverage. Our ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which we have no control. In addition, if we experience insurable events, our annual premiums could increase further or insurance may not be available at all or if it is available, on limited coverage items. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance or the loss of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and, as a result, our ability to make distributions.\nLEH holds a significant interest in us, and our related party transactions with LEH and its affiliates may cause conflicts of interest that may adversely affect us.\nJonathan P. Carroll, our Chief Executive Officer, President, Assistant Treasurer and Secretary, and Tommy L. Byrd, our interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary, are also a member and employee, respectively, of LEH and as a result may, under certain circumstances, have interests that differ from or conflict with our interests. Further, pursuant to the Operating Agreement, LEH manages and operates the Nixon Facility and Blue Dolphin\u2019s other operations. As a result of their relationship with LEH, Messrs. Carroll and Byrd may experience conflicts of interest in the execution of their duties on behalf of Blue Dolphin including with respect to the Operating Agreement.\nLEH owns approximately 81% of our Common Stock. Mr. Carroll is the majority owner of LEH. Through its ownership of such a large amount of Common Stock, LEH has significant influence over matters such as the election of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), control over our business, policies and affairs and other matters submitted to our stockholders. LEH is entitled to vote the Common Stock it owns in accordance with its interests, which may be contrary to our interests and those of other stockholders. LEH has interests that differ from the interests of our stockholders and, as a result, there is a risk that important business decisions will not be made in the best interest of some of our stockholders. LEH and its other affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us and are not obligated to offer us business opportunities. We believe that the transactions and agreements that we have entered into with LEH and its affiliates are on terms that are at least as favorable as could reasonably have been obtained at such time from third-parties. However, these relationships could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our Board is faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and LEH or its affiliates. The appearance of conflicts, even if such conflicts do not materialize, might adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of us, as well as our relationship with other companies and our ability to enter into new relationships in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business.\nOur business may suffer if any of the executive officers or other key employees discontinues employment with us. Furthermore, a shortage of skilled labor or disruptions in our labor force may make it difficult for us to maintain productivity.\nOur future success depends to a large extent on the services of the executive officers and other key employees and on our continuing ability to recruit, train and retain highly qualified employees in all areas of our operations. Furthermore, our operations require skilled and experienced employees with proficiency in multiple tasks. The competition for these employees is intense, and the loss of these executives or employees could harm our business. If any of these executives or other key personnel resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Primarily Related to Our Refining Operations\nThe price volatility of crude oil, other feedstocks, refined petroleum products, and fuel and utility services may have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur refining earnings, cash flows and liquidity from operations depend primarily on the margin above operating expenses (including the cost of refinery feedstocks, such as crude oil and condensate that are processed and blended into refined petroleum products) at which we are able to sell as refined petroleum products. Crude oil refining is primarily a margin-based business. In order to improve margins, it is important for a crude oil refinery to maximize the yields of high value finished petroleum produces and to minimize the costs of feedstocks and operating expenses. When the margin between refined petroleum product prices and crude oil and other feedstock costs decreases, our margins are negatively affected. Crude oil refining margins have historically been volatile, and are likely to continue to be volatile, as a result of a variety of factors, including fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, other feedstocks, refined petroleum products, and fuel and utility services. While an increase or decrease in the price of crude oil may result in a similar increase or decrease in prices for refined petroleum products, there may be a time lag in the realization of the similar increase or decrease in prices for refined petroleum products. The effect of changes in crude oil and condensate prices on our refining margins therefore depends, in part, on how quickly and how fully refined petroleum product prices adjust to reflect these changes.\nPrices of crude oil, other feedstocks and refined petroleum products depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, other feedstocks, and refined petroleum products. Such supply and demand are affected by, among other things:\n\u25cf\nchanges in global and local economic conditions;\n\u25cf\ndomestic and foreign demand for fuel products, especially in the United States, China and India;\n\u25cf\nworldwide political conditions, particularly in significant oil producing regions such as the Middle East, West Africa and Latin America;\n\u25cf\nthe level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil, other feedstocks, and refined petroleum products and the volume of crude oil, feedstocks, and refined petroleum products imported into the United States;\n\u25cf\navailability of and access to transportation infrastructure;\n\u25cf\ncapacity utilization rates of refineries in the United States;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to affect oil prices and maintain production controls;\n\u25cf\ndevelopment and marketing of alternative and competing fuels;\n\u25cf\ncommodities speculation;\n\u25cf\nnatural disasters (such as hurricanes and tornadoes), accidents, interruptions in transportation, inclement weather or other events that can cause unscheduled shutdowns or otherwise adversely affect our refineries;\n\u25cf\nfederal and state government regulations and taxes; and\n\u25cf\nlocal factors, including market conditions, weather conditions and the level of operations of other refineries and pipelines in our markets.\nRefining margins are volatile, and a reduction in anticipated refining margins will adversely affect the amount of cash we will have available for working capital.\nHistorically, refining margins have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship, or margin, between our refined petroleum product sales prices and our crude oil and condensate costs. Our crude oil and condensate acquisition costs and the prices at which we can ultimately sell our refined petroleum products depend upon numerous factors beyond our control.\nThe prices at which we sell refined petroleum products are strongly influenced by the commodity price of crude oil. If crude oil prices increase, our \u201crefinery operations\u201d business segment margins will fall unless we are able to pass along these price increases to our wholesale customers. Increases in the selling prices for refined petroleum products typically lag behind the rising cost of crude oil and may be difficult to implement when crude oil costs increase dramatically over a short period of time.\nPotential downtime at the Nixon Facility could result in lost margin opportunity, increased maintenance expense, increased inventory, and a reduction in cash available for payment of our obligations.\nThe safe and reliable operation of the Nixon Facility is key to our financial performance and results of operations, and we are particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our operations because all of our refining operations are conducted at a single facility. Although currently operating at anticipated levels, the Nixon Facility is still in a recommissioning phase and may require unscheduled downtime for unanticipated reasons, including maintenance and repairs, voluntary regulatory compliance measures, or cessation or suspension by regulatory authorities. Occasionally, the Nixon Facility experiences a temporary shutdown due to power outages as a result of high winds and thunderstorms. In the case of such a shutdown, the refinery must initiate a standard start-up process, and such process can last several days although we are typically able to resume normal operations the next day. Any scheduled or unscheduled downtime may result in lost margin opportunity, increased maintenance expense and a build-up of refined petroleum products inventory, which could reduce our ability to meet our payment obligations.\nLoss of market share by a key customer or consolidation among our customer base, could harm our operating results.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, 89% of our refined petroleum products sales came from five customers. These customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us, including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms, which often results in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier. Our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance. If we lose a key customer, if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our refined petroleum products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs, if a customer is acquired by one of our competitors or if a key customer suffers financial hardship, our operating results could be harmed.\nAdditionally, if there is consolidation among our customer base, our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale, which could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, if, as a result of increased leverage, customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished, we could decide not to sell our refined petroleum products to a particular customer, which could result in a decrease in our revenue. Consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products, replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders, each of which could harm our operating results.\nThe sale of refined petroleum products to the wholesale market is our primary business, and if we fail to maintain and grow the market share of our refined petroleum products, our operating results could suffer.\nOur success in the wholesale market depends in large part on our ability to maintain and grow our image and reputation as a reliable operator and to expand into and gain market acceptance of our refined petroleum products. Adverse perceptions of product quality, whether or not justified, or allegations of product quality issues, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish our reputation and cause our wholesale customers to choose refined petroleum products offered by our competitors.\nWe are dependent on third-parties for the transportation of crude oil and condensate into and refined petroleum products out of our Nixon Facility, and if these third-parties become unavailable to us, our ability to process crude oil and condensate and sell refined petroleum products to wholesale markets could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on trucks for the receipt of crude oil and condensate into and the sale of refined petroleum products out of our Nixon Facility. Since we do not own or operate any of these trucks, their continuing operation is not within our control. If any of the third-party trucking companies that we use, or the trucking industry in general, become unavailable to transport crude oil, condensate, and/or our refined petroleum products because of acts of God, accidents, government regulation, terrorism or other events, our revenue and net income would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend exclusively on GEL for our supply of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the loss of GEL or a material decrease in the supply of crude oil and other feedstocks generally available to the Nixon Facility could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nWe purchase 100% of our crude oil and other feedstocks exclusively from GEL under the Crude Supply Agreement. We have the ability to purchase crude oil and condensate from other suppliers with the prior consent of GEL. We are dependent on GEL for the provision of our crude oil and condensate. The loss of GEL as our crude oil and condensate supplier, to the extent we were unable to find another crude oil and condensate supplier, would adversely affect our financial results.\nTo the extent that GEL reduces the volume of crude oil and other feedstocks that they supply to us as a result of declining production, competition, or otherwise, our sales, net income and cash available for payments of our debt obligations would decline unless we were able to acquire comparable supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks on comparable terms from other suppliers. Fluctuations in crude oil prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by third-parties in the development of new oil reserves. Drilling activity generally decreases as crude oil prices decrease. We have no control over the level of drilling activity in the fields that supply the Nixon Facility, the amount of reserves underlying the wells in these fields, the rate at which production from a well will decline or the production decisions of producers. A material decrease in either crude oil and condensate production or drilling activity in the fields that supply the Nixon Facility, as a result of depressed commodity prices, natural production declines, governmental moratoriums on drilling or production activities, the availability and the cost of capital or otherwise, could result in a decline in the volume of crude oil and condensate that we refine.\nOur supplier sources a substantial amount, if not all, of our crude oil and condensate from the Eagle Ford Shale and may experience interruptions of supply from that region.\nOur supplier sources a substantial amount, if not all, of our crude oil and condensate from the Eagle Ford Shale. As a result, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of supply from that region caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, unavailability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of oil or natural gas produced from the wells in that area.\nOur refining operations and customers are primarily located within the Eagle Ford Shale and changes in the supply/demand balance in this region could result in lower refining margins.\nOur primary operating asset, the Nixon Facility, is located in Texas\u2019 Eagle Ford Shale and we market our refined petroleum products in a single, relatively limited geographic area. As a result, we are more susceptible to regional economic conditions than our more geographically diversified competitors. Should the supply/demand balance shift in our region as a result of changes in the local economy, an increase in refining capacity or other reasons, resulting in supply in the PADD 3 (Gulf Coast) region to exceed demand, we would have to deliver refined petroleum products to customers outside of our current operating region and thus incur considerably higher transportation costs, resulting in lower refining margins.\nHedging of our refined petroleum products and crude oil and condensate may limit our gains and expose us to other risks.\nWe are exposed to commodity price risk related to our refined petroleum products and crude oil and condensate inventories. The spread between the cost of crude oil and condensate and refined petroleum product sales prices is the primary factor affecting our operations, liquidity and financial condition. Our feedstock acquisition costs and refined petroleum products sales prices depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline, and refined petroleum products. Supply and demand for these products depend on various factors, including changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, availability of imports and exports, marketing of competitive fuels, and government regulation.\nUnder our inventory risk management policy, Genesis may, but is not required to, use derivative instruments as certain of our refined petroleum product inventories exceed certain thresholds in an effort to reduce our commodity price risk. However, Genesis\u2019 execution of the inventory risk management plan is outside of our control. Accordingly, there could be situations in which Genesis fails to execute on the plan or executes on the plan in a manner that causes significant losses to us, all of which are beyond our control. In the event that our inventory risk management system fails and/or is implemented poorly or not at all, we could experience a material and negative adverse effect on our operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nIf sufficient RINs are unavailable for purchase or if we have to pay a significantly higher price for RINs, or if we are otherwise unable to meet the EPA's RFS mandates, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nPursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the EPA has promulgated the Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS, which requires refiners to blend \"renewable fuels,\" such as ethanol, with their petroleum fuels or purchase renewable energy credits, known as RINs, in lieu of blending. Under the RFS, the volume of renewable fuels refineries like us are obligated to blend into their finished petroleum products increases annually over time until 2022. Beginning in February 2012, the Nixon Facility was required to blend renewable fuels into its diesel fuel or purchase RINs in lieu of blending. We submitted an application with the EPA requesting a small refinery exemption under the RFS mandate (\u201cHardship Exemption\u201d) due to disproportionate economic hardship and disparate impact that compliance with the RFS mandate would have on the Nixon Facility. In September 2014, the EPA granted the Nixon Facility a small refinery exemption from RFS requirements for 2013 and 2014. Recently the price of RINs has been extremely volatile.\nRegulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase our operational costs and reduce demand for our products.\nContinued political attention to issues concerning climate change, the role of human activity in it, and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on our operations and financial results.\nInternational agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, our activities in the particular jurisdiction and market conditions. Greenhouse gas emissions that could be regulated include those arising from the conversion of crude oil and other hydrocarbons into refined petroleum products, the transportation of crude oil and natural gas, and the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. Some matters related to these activities, such as actions taken by our competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond our control.\nThe effect of regulation on our financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, among others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which we would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the impact of legislation or other regulation on our ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of our products. Material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could also reduce demand for products we currently sell and adversely affect our sales volumes, revenues and margins.\nRisks Related to Our Pipelines and Oil and Gas Properties\nAsset retirement obligations for our pipelines and facilities assets and oil and gas properties are estimates, and actual costs could vary significantly.\nWe are required to record a liability for the discounted present value of our asset retirement obligations to plug and abandon inactive pipelines and related assets and non-producing oil and gas properties in which we have a working interest. Such asset retirement obligations may include complete structural removal and/or restoration of the land or seabed. Although management has used its best efforts to determine future asset retirement obligations, assumptions and estimates can be influenced by many factors beyond management\u2019s control, including, but not limited to, changes in regulatory requirements, which may be more restrictive in the future, changes in costs for abandonment related services and technologies, which could increase or decrease based on supply and demand, and/or extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, which may cause structural or other damage to pipeline and related assets and oil and gas properties. Accordingly, our estimate of future asset retirement obligations could differ materially from actual costs that may be incurred. As of December 31, 2014, our estimated future asset retirement obligations were $3.3 million. See \u201cPart II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note (12) Asset Retirement Obligations\u201d of this report for additional information regarding asset retirement obligations.", "PERMNO": 76310, "SIC": 4922, "TIC": "BDCO"}
