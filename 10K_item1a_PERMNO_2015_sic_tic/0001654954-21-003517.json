The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition, the global economic climate amplifies many of these risks.\nWe Face Intense Competition\nThe pharmaceutical industry is an expanding and rapidly changing industry characterized by intense competition. The Company believes that our ability to compete will be dependent in large part upon our ability to successfully operate business lines, continue recapitalization, and steadily enhance and improve our core technology products. In order to do so, we must effectively utilize and expand our research and development capabilities and, once developed, quickly convert new technology into products and processes, which can then be commercialized. Competition is based primarily on scientific and technological superiority, technical support, availability of patent protection, access to adequate capital, the ability to develop, acquire and market products and processes successfully, the ability to obtain governmental approvals and the ability to serve the particular needs of commercial customers. Corporations and institutions with greater resources therefore, have a significant competitive advantage.\nOur potential competitors include entities that develop and produce therapeutic agents and/or medical devices for treatment of human and animal disease. These include numerous public and private academic and research organizations and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies pursuing production of, among other things, biologics from cell cultures, genetically engineered drugs and natural and chemically synthesized drugs. Many of these potential competitors have substantially greater capital resources, research and development capabilities, manufacturing and marketing resources. Competitors may succeed in developing products or processes that are more effective or less costly or that gain regulatory approval prior to our products. The Company expects that the number of competitors and potential competitors will increase as more anti-viral and cytotoxic products receive commercial marketing approvals from the FDA or analogous foreign regulatory agencies. Any of these competitors may be more successful in manufacturing, marketing and distributing its products.\nOur Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\nIncreasing our product and service offerings will require scaling our management, financial and research and development resources. The complexity of the current focus of our business on innovative biotechnologies and treatments can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\nOur Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off.\nOur International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks\nWe have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations, sales and marketing channels, and research and development and licensing capacity. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis.\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf\nlocal economic and political conditions;\n\u25cf\ngovernment regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\nbusiness licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, medical devices and medical treatments;\n\u25cf\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties;\n\u25cf\nlaws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and\n\u25cf\ngeopolitical events, including war and terrorism.\nOur Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks\nOur business growth depends on commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide access to our research library and clinical data as part of licensing and sales and marketing agreements. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include research and development, clinical trials, diagnostic software and hardware design, and engaging third parties to perform services.\nOur licensing agreements partially dependent on the volume of the other company\u2019s sales. Therefore, when the other company\u2019s offerings are not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services.\nWe Face Significant Supply Risk\nWe are exposed to significant supply risks that may adversely affect our operating results. The Company\u2019s long-time human interferon producer is no longer manufacturing interferon. Plans for further clinical trials and commercialization of a low-dose interferon product have been placed on hold until a new source of interferon is found. The Company is actively seeking a new manufacturing partner and exploring sourcing options with pharmaceutical companies that have a supply of either recombinant interferon or natural human interferon made in a similar manner, but from a different cell line as our previous product.\nProcuring a new source of interferon may require additional studies to compare results to the Company\u2019s research and further clinical trials will have to be performed. The Company\u2019s inability to secure interferon supplies may adversely affect our operating results.\nGovernment Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing biologics, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices and treatments. A large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses expand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews and investigations by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations. Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our operations.\nClaims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations\nAs a company focusing on diagnostics and treatments for a wide range of human health care needs, we may be subject to actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide range of issues, including patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, product liability, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.", "PERMNO": 83840, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "AMAR"}
