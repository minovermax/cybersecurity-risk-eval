{"cik": "1399855", "company": "National American University Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-09-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\nRisks Related to the Extensive Regulation of our Business\nIf we fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements governing our university, we could incur significant monetary liabilities, fines and penalties, including loss of access to federal student loans and grants for our students, on which we are substantially dependent.\nFor our fiscal year ended May 31, 2018, we derived approximately 82.1% of our revenues (calculated on a cash basis) from federal student financial aid programs, known as Title IV programs, administered by the United States Department of Education, or the Department of Education. A significant percentage of our students rely on the availability of Title IV program funds to finance their cost of attending NAU. To participate in Title IV programs, a postsecondary institution must be authorized by the appropriate state education agency or agencies, be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the Department of Education, and be certified as an eligible institution by the Department of Education. In addition, NAU\u2019s operations and programs are regulated by other state education agencies and additional accrediting commissions. We are subject to extensive regulation by the education agencies of multiple states, the HLC, which is our institutional accrediting commission, various specialized accrediting commissions, and the Department of Education. These regulatory requirements cover the vast majority of our operations, including our educational programs, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, student recruiting and admissions, and financial operations. These regulatory requirements also affect our ability to open additional schools and locations, add new educational programs, change existing educational programs and change our ownership structure.\nThe agencies and commissions that regulate our operations periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements. Regulatory requirements are not always precise and clear, and regulatory agencies may sometimes disagree with the way we interpret or apply these requirements. Any misinterpretation by us of regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to comply with any of these regulatory requirements, we could suffer financial penalties, limitations on our operations, loss of accreditation, termination of or limitations on our ability to grant degrees and certificates, or limitations on or termination of our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, each of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we are charged with regulatory violations, our reputation could be damaged, which could have a negative impact on our enrollments and materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict with certainty how all of these regulatory requirements will be applied, or whether we will be able to comply with all of the applicable requirements in the future.\nIf we lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs for any reason, we would experience a dramatic and adverse decline in revenue, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects. Furthermore, we would be unable to continue our business as it currently is conducted, which would be expected to have a material effect on our ability to continue as a going concern.\nCongress may revise the laws governing Title IV programs or reduce funding for those programs which could reduce our enrollment and revenue and increase costs of operations.\nPolitical and budgetary concerns significantly affect Title IV programs. The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (the \u201cHEA\u201d), which is a federal law that governs Title IV programs, must be periodically reauthorized by Congress and was most recently reauthorized in August 2008. Congress also must determine funding levels for Title IV programs on an annual basis and can change the laws governing Title IV programs at any time. Apart from Title IV programs, eligible veterans and military personnel may receive educational benefits for the pursuit of higher education. A reduction in federal funding levels for Title IV programs, or for programs providing educational benefits to veterans and military personnel, could reduce the ability of some students to finance their education. We cannot predict with certainty the nature of any new regulatory requirements, other future revisions to the law or funding levels for Title IV programs. Because a significant percentage of our revenue is and is expected to be derived from Title IV programs, any action by Congress that significantly reduces Title IV program funding or the ability of us or our students to participate in Title IV programs could have a material effect on our enrollments, business, financial condition and results of operations. Congressional action also may require us to modify our practices in ways that could increase administrative costs and reduce profit margins, which could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf Congress significantly reduced the amount of available Title IV program funding, we would attempt to arrange for alternative sources of financial aid for our students, such as private sources. We cannot provide assurance that one or more private organizations would be willing or able to provide sufficient loans to students attending one of our schools or programs, or that the interest rate and other terms of such loans would be as favorable as Title IV program loans or acceptable to our students or that such private sources would be adequate to replace the full amount of the reduction in Title IV program funding. Therefore, even if some form of private financing sources becomes available, our enrollment could be materially affected. In addition, private organizations could require us to guarantee all or part of this assistance resulting in additional costs to us. If we were to provide more direct financial assistance to our students, we would assume increased credit risks and incur additional costs, which could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOn December 13, 2017, the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation to reauthorize the HEA. If enacted in its current form, this legislation would substantially amend the HEA, including changes to Title IV programs and provisions governing institutional participation therein. We cannot predict when or whether the full House of Representatives will vote on the legislation, nor when or whether similar legislation will be considered by the U.S. Senate. Furthermore, we cannot predict with any certainty the outcome of the HEA reauthorization process nor the extent to which any legislation, if adopted, could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNew rulemaking by the Department of Education could result in regulatory changes that could reduce our enrollment and revenue, increase costs of operations, and adversely affect our business.\nNegotiated rulemaking is a process whereby the Department of Education consults with members of the postsecondary education community to identify issues of concern and attempts to agree on proposed regulatory revisions to address those issues before the Department of Education formally proposes any regulations. If the Department of Education and negotiators cannot reach consensus on the entire package of draft regulations, the Department of Education is authorized to propose regulations without being bound by any agreements made in the negotiation process. In recent years, the Department of Education has held negotiated rulemaking sessions and published regulations on various topics, as described further in \u201cItem 1 - Business - Regulatory Matters - Changes in Department of Education Regulations.\u201d\nWe cannot predict with certainty when or whether the Department of Education will propose or finalize regulations on topics that may impact us, or the impact of any regulations resulting from the Department of Education\u2019s current or future rulemaking activities. In addition, Congress may promulgate legislation, and the executive branch may issue executive orders which would impact us. Any such actions could reduce our enrollments, increase our cost of doing business, and have a material effect on our business. In addition, any regulations that reduce or eliminate our students\u2019 access to Title IV program funds, that require us to change or eliminate programs or that increase our costs of compliance could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe recently increased focus by Congress on the for-profit education sector could result in legislation or further Department of Education rulemaking restricting Title IV program participation by proprietary schools in a manner that could materially affect our business.\nIn recent years, Congress has placed increased focus on the role that for-profit educational institutions play in higher education, which is described further in \u201cItem 1 - Business - Regulatory Matters - Changes in Department of Education Regulations.\u201d As described above, the HELP Committee and other Congressional members and committees have scrutinized various aspects of the education industry, including student debt, student recruiting, student outcomes and accreditation matters. The HELP Committee held a series of hearings on the proprietary education sector and released a report in July 2012, which could lead to further investigations of proprietary schools and additional regulations promulgated by the Department of Education. The executive branch and the Department of Defense have also increased their focus on the provision of educational benefits for military personnel and veterans.\nWe cannot predict whether, or the extent to which, these hearings, reports and review will result in legislation or further rulemaking affecting our participation in Title IV programs. To the extent that any laws or regulations are adopted that limit our participation in Title IV programs or the amount of student financial aid for which the students at our institutions are eligible, our enrollments, revenues and results of operation could be materially affected. Any actions that change the requirements for our participation in Title IV Programs or the amount of student financial aid for which our students are eligible would negatively impact our business.\nRecent statutory and regulatory changes substantially increased reporting and other requirements that could impair our reputation and adversely affect our enrollments. Our failure to comply with or accurately interpret pertinent disclosure requirements may subject us to penalties and other sanctions.\nThe most recent reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, in August 2008, contains numerous revisions to the requirements governing Title IV programs. Among other things, institutions participating in Title IV programs are subject to extensive additional reporting and disclosure requirements. Additionally, the Department of Education\u2019s gainful employment regulations require a number of specific disclosures to students and prospective students regarding our educational programs. Such disclosures include the occupations that NAU\u2019s educational programs prepare students to enter upon completing their program, total program costs and median student debt incurred for our programs, along with program completion and placement rates for our programs. Any failure by us to properly interpret these new requirements could subject us to limitation, suspension or termination of our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, the imposition of conditions on our participation in Title IV programs, monetary liabilities, fines and penalties or other sanctions imposed by the Department of Education, which could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The prospect of such sanctions may cause us to conservatively interpret the new reporting requirements of Title IV programs by the Department of Education, which may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nIf any of the education regulatory agencies or commissions that regulate us do not approve or delay any required approvals of transactions involving a change of control, our ability to operate or participate in Title IV programs may be impaired.\nIf we experience a change in control under the standards of the Department of Education, the HLC, any applicable state educational licensing agency, or any specialized accrediting agency commission, we must notify or seek the approval of each such agency. These agencies do not have uniform criteria for what constitutes a change in control. Transactions or events that typically constitute a change in control include significant acquisitions or dispositions of the voting stock of an institution or its parent company, and significant changes in the composition of the board of directors of an institution or its parent company. Some of these transactions or events may be beyond our control. Our failure to obtain, or a delay in receiving, approval of any change in control from the Department of Education, the HLC or applicable state educational licensing agencies could impair our ability to operate or participate in Title IV programs, which could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to obtain, or a delay in receiving, approval of any change in control from any state in which we are currently licensed or authorized, or from any of our specialized accrediting commissions, could require us to suspend our activities in that state or suspend offering the applicable programs until we receive the required approval, or could otherwise impair our operations. The potential adverse effects of a change in control could influence future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance or redemption of our stock, which could discourage bids for outstanding shares of the stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares.\nWe cannot offer new programs, expand our operations into certain states or acquire additional schools if such actions are not approved by the applicable regulatory and accrediting agencies, and we may have to repay Title IV funds disbursed to students enrolled in any such programs, schools or states if we do not obtain prior approval.\nOur expansion plans include offering new educational programs, expanding operations in additional states and potentially acquiring existing schools from other companies. If we are unable to obtain the necessary approvals for such new programs, operations or acquisitions from the Department of Education, the HLC or any applicable state educational licensing agency or accrediting commission, or if we are unable to obtain such approvals in a timely manner, our ability to consummate the planned actions and provide Title IV program funds to any affected students would be impaired, which could have a material effect on our expansion plans and growth. If we were to determine erroneously that any such action did not need approval or that we had obtained all required approvals, including all required approvals for each of our current programs and locations, we could be liable for repayment of Title IV program funds provided to students in that program or at that location.\nIf the Department of Education does not recertify us to continue participating in Title IV programs, our students would lose their access to Title IV program funds, or we could be recertified but required to accept significant limitations as a condition of our continued participation in Title IV programs.\nThe Department of Education certification to participate in Title IV programs lasts a maximum of six years, and institutions are required to seek recertification from the Department of Education on a regular basis to continue their participation in Title IV programs. An institution must also apply for recertification by the Department of Education if it undergoes a change in control, as defined by Department of Education regulations, and may be subject to similar review if it expands its operations or educational programs in certain ways. Generally, the recertification process includes a review by the Department of Education of the institution\u2019s educational programs and locations, administrative capability, financial responsibility and other oversight categories. The Department of Education could limit, suspend or terminate an institution\u2019s participation in Title IV programs for violations of the Higher Education Act or Title IV regulations. Our current certification to participate in the Title IV programs became effective in June 2013 and extends through March 31, 2019. There can be no assurance that the Department of Education will recertify us after our current period of certification or that it would not impose restrictions in connection with any such recertification. In addition, the Department of Education may take emergency action to suspend our certification without advance notice if it receives reliable information that we are violating Title IV requirements and it determines that immediate action is necessary to prevent misuse of Title IV funds. If the Department of Education does not renew or withdraws our certification to participate in Title IV programs at any time, our students would no longer be able to receive Title IV program funds. Similarly, the Department of Education could renew our certification, but restrict or delay our students\u2019 receipt of Title IV funds, limit the number of students to whom it could disburse such funds or impose other restrictions. Any of these outcomes could have a material effect on NAU\u2019s enrollments and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe would lose our ability to participate in Title IV programs if we fail to maintain our institutional accreditation, and our student enrollments could decline if we fail to maintain any of our accreditations or approvals.\nAn institution must be accredited by a postsecondary accrediting commission recognized by the Department of Education to participate in Title IV programs. We have been granted institutional accreditation by the HLC, which is a regional accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education. To remain accredited, we must continuously meet accreditation standards relating to, among other things, performance, governance, institutional integrity, educational quality, faculty, administrative capability, resources and financial stability. Our accreditation by the HLC was most recently continued in January 2015. In addition, many of our individual educational programs are also accredited by specialized accrediting commissions or approved by specialized state agencies. If we fail to satisfy the standards of any of those specialized accrediting commissions or state agencies, we could lose the specialized accreditation or approval for the affected programs, which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs and have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain any of our state authorizations, we would lose our ability to operate in that state and for campuses in the state to participate in Title IV programs.\nWe operate physical facilities offering educational programs in South Dakota, Colorado, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. To maintain our state authorizations, we must continuously meet standards relating to, among other things, educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, marketing and recruitment, financial operations, addition of new locations and educational programs and various operational and administrative procedures. We may need to apply for additional authorization in these or other states in which we are authorized in order to comply with the Department of Education\u2019s state authorization requirements, and the authorization process could result in unexpected delays or other setbacks that could jeopardize our Title IV eligibility. If we fail to satisfy any of these standards, we could lose our authorization from the applicable state educational agency to offer educational programs and could be forced to cease operations in such state. Such a loss of authorization would also cause our physical campus in the state to lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. Some states may also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of the Department of Education and many require the posting of surety bonds. If we fail to comply with state licensing requirements, we may lose our state licensure or authorizations. If we lose state licensure in a state in which we have a physical location, we would also lose Title IV eligibility in that state. Any such event could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn December 19, 2016, the Department of Education published final regulations regarding state authorization for programs offered through distance education and state authorization for foreign locations of institutions. Among other provisions, these final regulations require that an institution participating in the Title IV federal student aid programs and offering postsecondary education through distance education be authorized by each state in which the institution enrolls students, if such authorization is required by the state. These final regulations, which became effective July 1, 2018, are further described in See \u201cItem 1 - Business - Regulation of Federal Financial Aid Programs - State Authorization.\u201d Independent of this matter of federal regulation, several states have asserted jurisdiction over educational institutions offering online programs that have no physical location or other presence in the state, but that have some activity in the state, such as enrolling or offering educational services to students who reside in the state, conducting practice or sponsoring internships in the state, employing faculty who reside in the state or advertising to or recruiting prospective students in the state. Thus, our activities in certain states constitute a presence requiring licensure or authorization under requirements of state law, regulation or policy of the state educational agency, even though we do not have a physical facility in such states. Therefore, in addition to the states where we maintain physical facilities, we have either obtained approvals or exemptions, or are currently in the process of obtaining such approvals or exemptions, that we believe are necessary in connection with our activities that may constitute a presence in such states requiring licensure or authorization by the state educational agency based on the laws, rules or regulations of that state. Notwithstanding our efforts to obtain approvals or exemptions, state regulatory requirements for online education vary among the states, are not well developed in many states, are imprecise or unclear in some states and can change frequently. Because we enroll students in online programs in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, we expect that regulatory authorities in other states where we are not currently licensed or authorized may request that we seek additional licenses or authorizations for these institutions in their states in the future. In recent years several states have voluntarily entered into State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (\u201cSARA\u201d) that establish standards for interstate offering of post-secondary distance education courses and programs. If an institution\u2019s home state participates in SARA and authorizes the institution to provide distance education in accordance with SARA standards, then the institution need not obtain additional authorizations for distance education from any other SARA member state. The SARA participation requirements and process are administered by the four regional higher education compacts in the United States (the Midwestern Higher Education Compact, the New England Board of Higher Education, the Southern Regional Education Board and the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education) and are overseen by the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements. NAU is approved to participate in SARA, through the SARA Coordinator of the South Dakota Board of Regents as a state portal agency with its most recent approval effective from April 20, 2018 through April 19, 2019.\nIf we fail to comply with state licensing or authorization requirements for a state, or fail to obtain licenses or authorizations when required, we could lose state licensure or authorization by that state, which could prohibit us from recruiting prospective students or offering services to current students in that state. We could also be subject to other sanctions, including restrictions on activities in that state, fines and penalties. We review the licensure requirements of other states when we believe that it is appropriate to determine whether our activities in those states may constitute a presence or otherwise may require licensure or authorization by the respective state education agencies. New laws, regulations or interpretations related to offering educational programs online could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students in particular states, which could, in turn, adversely affect our enrollments and revenues and have a material effect on our business.\nIf we do not comply with the Department of Education\u2019s \u201cadministrative capability\u201d standards, we could suffer financial penalties, be required to accept other limitations to continue participating in Title IV programs or lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nDepartment of Education regulations specify extensive criteria an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite \u201cadministrative capability\u201d to participate in Title IV programs. These criteria require, among other things, that we:\n\u25cf\ncomply with all applicable Title IV program regulations;\n\u25cf\nhave capable and sufficient personnel to administer the federal student financial aid programs;\n\u25cf\nnot have student loan cohort default rates in excess of specified levels;\n\u25cf\nhave acceptable methods of defining and measuring the satisfactory academic progress of our students;\n\u25cf\nhave various procedures in place for safeguarding federal funds;\n\u25cf\nnot be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension;\n\u25cf\nprovide financial aid counseling to our students;\n\u25cf\nrefer to the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Inspector General any credible information indicating that any applicant, student, employee or agent of the institution has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs;\n\u25cf\nsubmit in a timely manner all reports and financial statements required by Title IV regulations; and\n\u25cf\nnot otherwise appear to lack administrative capability.\nIf an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria or comply with any other Department of Education regulations, the Department of Education may:\n\u25cf\nrequire the institution to repay Title IV program funds;\n\u25cf\ntransfer the institution from the \u201cadvance\u201d system of payment of Title IV program funds to cash monitoring status or to the \u201creimbursement\u201d system of payment;\n\u25cf\nplace the institution on provisional certification status; or\n\u25cf\ncommence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate the participation of the institution in Title IV programs.\nIf we were found not to have satisfied the Department of Education\u2019s \u201cadministrative capability\u201d requirements, we could be limited in our access to, or lose, Title IV program funding, which could significantly reduce our enrollments and have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Department of Education may adopt regulations governing federal student loan debt forgiveness that could result in liability for amounts based on borrower defenses or affect the Department of Education\u2019s assessment of our institutional capability.\nOn November 1, 2016, the Department of Education published final regulations that among other provisions, establish new standards and processes for determining whether a Direct Loan Program borrower has a defense to repayment on a loan due to acts or omissions by the institution at which the loan was used by the borrower for educational expenses. These final regulations (the \u201c2016 Borrower Defense Final Rule\u201d) were published with an effective date of July 1, 2017. Among other topics, the 2016 Borrower Defense Final Rule establishes permissible borrower defense claims for discharge, procedural rules under which claims will be adjudicated, time limits for borrowers\u2019 claims, and guidelines for recoupment by the Department of Education of discharged loan amounts from institutions of higher education. The 2016 Borrower Defense Final Rule also prohibits schools from using any pre-dispute arbitration agreements, prohibits schools from prohibiting relief in the form of class actions by student borrowers, and invalidates clauses imposing requirements that students pursue an internal dispute resolution process before contacting authorities regarding concerns about an institution. For proprietary institutions, the 2016 Borrower Defense Final Rule describes the threshold for loan repayment rates that will require specific disclosures to current and prospective students and the applicable loan repayment rate methodology. The 2016 Borrower Defense Final Rule also establishes important new financial responsibility and administrative capacity requirements for both not-for-profit and for-profit institutions participating in the Title IV programs. For example, certain events would automatically trigger the need for a school to obtain a letter of credit, including for publicly traded institutions, if the SEC warns the school that it may suspend trading on the school\u2019s stock, the school failed to timely file a required annual or quarterly report with the SEC, or the exchange on which the stock is traded notifies the school that it is not in compliance with exchange requirements or the stock is delisted. Other events would will require a recalculation of an institution\u2019s composite score of financial responsibility, including, for a proprietary institution whose score is less than 1.5, any withdrawal of an owner's equity by any means, including by declaring a dividend, unless the equity is transferred within the affiliated entity group on whose basis the composite score was calculated. The 2016 Borrower Defense Final Rule also sets forth events that are discretionary triggers for letters of credit, meaning that if any of them occur, the Department of Education may choose to require a letter of credit, increase an existing letter of credit requirement or demand some other form of surety from the institution. The 2016 Borrower Defense Final Rule provides that if an institution fails to meet the composite score requirement for longer than three years under provisional certification, the Department of Education may mandate additional financial protection from the institution or any party with \u201csubstantial control\u201d over the institution. Such parties with \u201csubstantial control\u201d must agree to jointly and severally guarantee the Title IV program liabilities of the institution at the end of the three-year provisional certification period. Under current regulations, a party may be deemed to have \"substantial control\" over an institution if, among other factors, the party directly or indirectly holds an ownership interest of 25% or more of an institution, or is a member of the board of directors, a general partner, the chief executive officer or other executive officer of the institution.\nOn June 15, 2017, the Department of Education announced an indefinite delay to its implementation of the 2016 Borrower Defense Final Rule, and on June 16, 2017 published a notice of intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed revisions to the rule. On August 30, 2017, the Department of Education published a Federal Register notice requesting nominations for individuals to serve on this negotiated rulemaking committee, and on October 24, 2017, the Department of Education promulgated an interim final rule under which the effective date of most substantive provisions of the 2016 Borrower Defense Final Rule were delayed until July 1, 2019. The negotiated rulemaking committee sessions occurred in November 2017, January 2018, and February 2018, during which the Department of Education and negotiators failed to reach consensus on a revised regulation. Additionally, on July 6, 2017, the attorneys general of 18 states and the District of Columbia filed suit against the Department of Education claiming that its delay of the 2016 Borrower Defense Final Rule violated applicable law, including the Administrative Procedure Act. On September 12, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a decision concluding that the above-describeddelay of the 2016 Borrower Defense Final Rule was improper. The Court further ordered additional oral argument on the matter of remedies, and thus has not yet entered or finalized a remedial order in connection with its decision. The Department of Education may appeal the court\u2019s decision and any subsequent remedial order. We therefore cannot predict with any certainty the final outcome or impact of this litigation.\nOn July 31, 2018, the Department of Education published in the Federal Register a proposed rule (the \u201c2018 Borrower Defense Proposed Rule\u201d) which would replace most substantive provisions of the 2016 Borrower Defense Final Rule. The 2018 Borrower Defense Proposed Rule would establish a federal standard for individual borrowers to raise as a defense to repaying loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2019. This proposed regulation would permit borrowers to challenge repayment of loans based on misrepresentation, defined to include acts or omissions by an institution which are false, misleading or deceptive, and which are made with knowledge of their falsity, deception, or misleading nature, or with reckless disregard for the truth. The 2018 Borrower Defense Proposed Rule seeks comment as to whether such a defense may be raised affirmatively or may only arise defensively, out of a collection action. The proposed regulation also would establish a five-year window following a final decision on borrower defense for the Department of Education to seek recoupment from an institution. The 2018 Borrower Defense Proposed Rule would permit schools to use class-action waivers and pre-dispute arbitration agreements, but would require schools to provide additional disclosures and borrower counseling when including such provisions in enrollment agreements. The 2018 Borrower Defense Proposed rule also sets forth automatic and discretionary triggers under which the Department of Education may require the school to provide a letter of credit, cash, or other form of surety, or may agree to provide surety through an offset of future Title IV funds for a six-to-twelve month period. For example, certain events would automatically trigger the need for a school to obtain a letter of credit or other surety, including for publicly traded institutions, if the SEC warns the school that it may suspend trading on the school\u2019s stock, the school failed to timely file a required annual or quarterly report with the SEC, or the exchange on which the stock is traded notifies the school that it is not in compliance with exchange requirements or the stock is delisted. Other events would require a recalculation of an institution\u2019s composite score of financial responsibility including, for a proprietary institution whose score is less than 1.5, any withdrawal of an owner\u2019s equity by any means, including by declaring a dividend, unless the equity is transferred within the affiliated group on whose basis the composite score was calculated; or for any institution, the incursion of a borrower defense liability which reduces the institution\u2019s composite score to under 1.0. The 2018 Borrower Defense Proposed Rule also sets forth events that are discretionary triggers for letters of credit or other forms of surety, meaning that if any of them occur, the Department of Education may choose to require a letter of credit, increase an existing letter of credit requirement or demand some other form of surety from the institution. The 2018 Borrower Defense Proposed Rule also includes provisions regarding the treatment of operating leases in the financial responsibility composite score methodology, would more specifically define and require disclosures concerning the composite score\u2019s inclusion of debt obtained for long-term purposes, and would revise limited aspects of the composite score formula to account for changes in accounting terminology. Following a 30-day public comment period, the Department of Education is expected to issue a final rule by November 1, 2018, taking effect July 1, 2019. We cannot predict the extent to which that final rule may differ from the 2018 Borrower Defense Proposed Rule, or may differ from the previously promulgated 2016 Borrower Defense Final Rule, or the impact that any such revised rule might have on our business. Any regulation that increases potential borrower defense liabilities or affects the Department of Education\u2019s assessment of our institutional capability could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not meet specific financial responsibility standards established by the Department of Education, we may be required to post a letter of credit or accept other limitations to continue participating in Title IV programs, or we could lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nTo participate in Title IV programs, an eligible institution must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the Department of Education, or post a letter of credit in favor of the Department of Education and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in Title IV programs. These financial responsibility tests are applied to each institution on an annual basis based on the institution\u2019s audited financial statements, and may be applied at other times, such as if the institution undergoes a change in control. The Department of Education may also apply such measures of financial responsibility to the operating company and ownership entities of an eligible institution and, if such measures are not satisfied by the operating company or ownership entities, require the institution to post a letter of credit in favor of the Department of Education and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in Title IV programs. The operating restrictions that may be placed on an institution that does not meet the quantitative standards of financial responsibility include being transferred from the \u201cadvance payment\u201d method of receiving Title IV program funds to either the \u201creimbursement\u201d or the \u201cheightened cash monitoring\u201d system, which could result in a significant delay in the institution\u2019s receipt of those funds. Limitations on, or termination of, our participation in Title IV programs as a result of our failure to demonstrate financial responsibility would limit our students\u2019 access to Title IV program funds, which could significantly reduce enrollments and have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs described in more detail under \u201cItem 1 - Business - Regulatory Matters - Regulation of Federal Student Aid Programs - Financial Responsibility,\u201d the Department of Education annually assesses our financial responsibility through a composite score determination. Our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017 indicated our composite score was 1.8, respectively, which is sufficient to be deemed financially responsible under the Department of Education\u2019s requirements. Our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018 indicate our composite score is 1.3. This score is subject to a final determination by the Department of Education once it receives and reviews our consolidated audited financial statements for the 2018 fiscal year, but we believe it is likely that the Department of Education will determine that we are \u201cin the zone\u201d and that we will be required to operate under the \u201czone alternative\u201d requirements as well as any other requirements that the Department of Education might impose in its discretion. If we are unable to meet the minimum composite score or to comply with the other standards of financial responsibility, and could not post a required letter of credit or comply with the alternative bases for establishing financial responsibility, then our students could lose their access to Title IV program funding.\nOn November 1, 2016, as part of the 2016 Borrower Defense Final Rule, the Department of Education adopted final regulations that revise its general standards of financial responsibility to include various actions and events that would require institutions to provide the Department of Education with irrevocable letters of credit. On June 15, 2017, the Department of Education announced an indefinite delay to its implementation of the 2016 Borrower Defense Final Rule, and on June 16, 2017 published a notice of intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed revisions to the rule. Additionally, on July 6, 2017, the attorneys general of 18 states and the District of Columbia filed suit against the Department of Education claiming that its delay of the 2016 Borrower Defense Final Rule violated applicable law, including the Administrative Procedure Act. On September 12, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a decision concluding that the above-described delay of the 2016 Borrower Defense Final Rule was improper. The Court further ordered additional oral argument on the matter of remedies, and thus has not yet entered or finalized a remedial order in connection with its decision. The Department of Education may appeal the court\u2019s decision and any subsequent remedial order. We therefore cannot predict with any certainty the final outcome or impact of this litigation. In addition, on August 30, 2017, the Department of Education published a Federal Register notice requesting nominations for individuals to serve on this negotiated rulemaking committee, and on October 24, 2017, the Department of Education promulgated an interim final rule under which the effective date of most substantive provisions of the 2016 Borrower Defense Final Rule were delayed until July 1, 2019. The rulemaking committee sessions occurred in November 2017, January 2018, and February 2018, during which the Department of Education and negotiators failed to reach consensus on a revised regulation.\nOn July 31, 2018, the Department of Education published in the Federal Register the 2018 Borrower Defense Proposed Rule, which would replace most substantive provisions of the 2016 Borrower Defense Final Rule. For additional information regarding the 2016 Borrower Defense Final Rule and the 2018 Borrower Defense Proposed Rule, see \u201c- The Department of Education may adopt regulations governing federal student loan debt forgiveness that could result in liability for amounts based on borrower defenses or affect the Department of Education\u2019s assessment of our institutional capability.\u201d We cannot predict with certainty the timing or substance of any future regulations concerning financial responsibility standards for Title IV program participation, nor the impact that such regulations might have on our business. Any Department of Education regulations that require NAU to post letters of credit or accept other limitations to continue participating in Title IV programs could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may lose our eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs if the percentage of our revenues derived from Title IV programs is too high.\nA provision of the Higher Education Act commonly referred to as the 90/10 Rule, as amended in August 2008, provides that a for-profit educational institution loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if, under a complex regulatory formula that requires cash basis accounting and other adjustments to the calculation of revenue, the institution derives more than 90% of its revenues from Title IV program funds for any two consecutive fiscal years. An institution that derives more than 90% of its revenue (on a cash basis) from Title IV programs for any single fiscal year will be placed on provisional certification for at least two fiscal years and may be subject to additional conditions or sanctions imposed by the Department of Education. During the period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions included in the institution\u2019s program participation agreement with the Department of Education. In addition, the Department of Education may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for recertification or approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another school or make any other significant change. If the Department of Education determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, the Department of Education may seek to revoke the institution\u2019s certification to participate in Title IV programs without advance notice or opportunity for the institution to challenge the action. If we were to violate the 90/10 Rule, we would become ineligible to participate in Title IV programs as of the first day of the fiscal year following the second consecutive fiscal year in which we exceeded the 90% threshold and would be unable to regain eligibility for two fiscal years thereafter. Under regulations that were published by the Department of Education in October 2009, a proprietary institution must disclose in a footnote to its annual audited financial statements its 90/10 calculation and the amounts of the federal and non-federal revenues, by source, included in its 90/10 calculation. The certified public accountant that prepares the institution\u2019s audited financial statements is required to review that information and test the institution\u2019s calculation. For our 2018, 2017 and 2016 fiscal years, we derived approximately 82.1%, 82.6% and 86.8%, respectively, of our revenues (calculated on a cash basis) from Title IV program funds. If we violate the 90/10 Rule and continue to disburse Title IV program funds to students after the effective date of our loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, we would be required to return those funds to the Department of Education. We are exploring the feasibility of various potential measures that would be intended to reduce the percentage of NAU\u2019s cash basis revenue attributable under the 90/10 Rule to Title IV Program funds. Among other things, we expect to expand our non-Title IV continuing education programming. If we were to violate the 90/10 Rule, we would become ineligible to participate in Title IV programs as of the first day of the fiscal year following the second consecutive fiscal year in which we exceeded the 90% Title IV program funds threshold and would be unable to regain eligibility for two fiscal years thereafter.\nIncreases in Title IV grant and loan limits currently or in the future may result in an increase in the revenues we receive from Title IV programs. Further, a significant number of states in which we operate have faced budget constraints, which have caused or may cause them to reduce state appropriations in a number of areas, including with respect to the amount of financial assistance provided to postsecondary students, which could further increase our percentage of revenues derived from Title IV program funds. Also, the employment circumstances of our students or their parents could also increase reliance on Title IV program funds. Furthermore, from time to time, legislation is introduced that would make a proprietary institution ineligible to participate in Title IV programs if it derives more than 85% of its revenues from federal funds, including Title IV programs, revenues from the GI Bill and Department of Defense Tuition Assistance funds. We are exploring the feasibility of various potential measures that would be intended to reduce the percentage of NAU\u2019s cash basis revenue attributable under the 90/10 Rule to Title IV Program funds. Certain measures that could be taken to maintain compliance with the 90/10 Rule may reduce our revenues, increase our operating expenses, or both, perhaps significantly. If we become ineligible to participate in Title IV programs as a result of noncompliance with the 90/10 Rule, it can be expected to have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if our student loan default rates are too high.\nAn educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if, for three consecutive years, 30% or more of its students who were required to begin repayment on their student loans in the relevant fiscal year default on their payment by the end of the next federal fiscal year or the subsequent fiscal year. In addition, an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if the default rate of its students exceeds 40% for any single year.\nThe Department of Education generally publishes draft cohort default rates in February of each year for the prepayment period that ended the prior September. Draft cohort default rates do not result in sanctions, are subject to subsequent data corrections and appeals by an institution, and can change between their issuance to institutions and the Department of Education\u2019s release of official cohort default rates, which are typically issued annually in September. Our official cohort default rates for federal fiscal years 2014 and 2013 are 24.1% and 23.4%, respectively. The draft cohort rate for federal fiscal year 2015 is 23.7%. Any increase in interest rates or reliance on \u201cself-pay\u201d students, as well as declines in income or job losses for our students, could contribute to higher default rates on student loans. Exceeding the student loan default rate thresholds and losing eligibility to participate in Title IV programs would have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any future changes in the formula for calculating student loan default rates, economic conditions or other factors that cause our default rates to increase, could place us in danger of losing our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which would have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe would be subject to sanctions if we were to pay impermissible commissions, bonuses or other incentive payments to individuals involved in certain recruiting, admission or financial aid activities.\nThe Higher Education Act prohibits an educational institution that participates in Title IV programs from making any commission, bonus or other incentive payments based directly or indirectly on securing enrollments or financial aid to any persons or entities involved in student recruiting or admissions activities, or in making decisions about the award of student financial assistance. The statutory prohibition against incentive compensation applies to any person engaged in student recruitment or admissions activities or in making financial aid award decisions, and any higher level employees with responsibility for such activities. Since July 1, 2011, the Department of Education\u2019s implementing regulations have effectively deemed any commission, bonus or other incentive compensation based in any part, directly or indirectly, on securing enrollment or awarding financial aid to be inconsistent with the statutory prohibition against incentive compensation payments. The Department of Education also issued a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter in March 2011, providing additional guidance regarding the scope of the prohibition on incentive compensation and to what employees and types of activities the prohibition applies. The July 1, 2011 revisions to the Department of Education\u2019s regulations required us to change our compensation practices and has had and will continue to have a significant impact on the rate at which students enroll in our programs and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, in recent years, other postsecondary educational institutions have been named as defendants to whistleblower lawsuits, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d cases, brought by current or former employees pursuant to the Federal False Claims Act, alleging that their institution\u2019s compensation practices did not comply with the incentive compensation rule. A qui tam case is a civil lawsuit brought by one or more individuals, referred to as a relator, on behalf of the federal government for an alleged submission to the government of a false claim for payment. The relator, often a current or former employee, is entitled to a share of the government\u2019s recovery in the case, including the possibility of treble damages. A qui tam action is always filed under seal and remains under seal until the government decides whether to intervene in the case. If the government intervenes, it takes over primary control of the litigation. If the government declines to intervene in the case, the relator may nonetheless elect to continue to pursue the litigation at his or her own expense on behalf of the government. Any such litigation could be costly and could divert management\u2019s time and attention away from the business, regardless of whether a claim has merit.\nWe are subject to sanctions if we fail to correctly calculate and timely return Title IV program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program.\nAn institution participating in Title IV programs must calculate the amount of unearned Title IV program funds that it has disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completing such programs and must return those unearned funds to the appropriate lender or the Department of Education in a timely manner, generally within 45 days of the date the institution determines that the student has withdrawn. If the unearned funds are not properly calculated and timely returned for a sufficient percentage of students, we may have to post a letter of credit in favor of the Department of Education equal to 25% of Title IV program funds that should have been returned for such students in the prior fiscal year, and we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by the Department of Education. If we do not correctly calculate and timely return unearned Title IV program funds, we may have to post letters of credit in favor of the Department of Education, may be liable for repayment of Title IV funds and related interest and may otherwise be subject to adverse actions by the Department of Education, including termination of our participation in Title IV programs, any of which could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf any of our educational programs fail to qualify as programs that lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation, it could reduce our enrollment and revenue, increase costs of operations, and adversely affect our business.\nUnder the Higher Education Act, proprietary schools generally are eligible to participate in Title IV programs in respect of educational programs that lead to \u201cgainful employment in a recognized occupation.\u201d Historically, the concept of \u201cgainful employment\u201d has not been defined in detail. On October 31, 2014, the Department of Education published final regulations to define \u201cgainful employment\u201d which became effective on July 1, 2015. The gainful employment regulations define this concept using ratios, one based on annual DTE and another based on DTI ratio. Under the gainful employment regulations, an educational program with a DTE ratio at or below 8% or a DTI ratio at or below 20% is considered \u201cpassing.\u201d An educational program with a DTE ratio greater than 8% but less than or equal to 12% or a DTI ratio greater than 20% but less than or equal to 30% is considered to be \u201cin the zone.\u201d An educational program with a DTE ratio greater than 12% and a DTI ratio greater than 30% is considered \u201cfailing.\u201d An educational program will cease to be eligible for students to receive Title IV program funds if its DTE and DTI ratios are failing in to out of any three consecutive award years or if both of these rates are failing or in the zone for four consecutive award years. On January 9, 2017, the Department of Education issued final debt-to-earnings rates to institutions for the first gainful employment debt measurement year. For a discussion of the performance of our current educational programs against the required debt measures, see \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulatory Matters - Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs.\u201d\nAdditionally, the gainful employment regulations require an institution to certify to the Department of Education that its educational programs subject to the regulations, which include all programs offered by us, meet the applicable requirements for graduates to be professionally or occupationally licensed or certified in the state in which the institution is located. If we are unable to certify that our programs meet the applicable state requirements for graduates to be professionally or occupationally certified in that state, then we may need to cease offering certain programs in certain states or to students who are residents in certain states. The gainful employment regulations further include requirements for the reporting of student and program data by institutions to the Department of Education and expand the disclosure requirements that have been in effect since July 1, 2011.\nOn June 16, 2017, the Department of Education published a notice of intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed revisions to the gainful employment regulations. On August 30, 2017, the Department of Education published a Federal Register notice requesting nominations for individuals to serve on this negotiated rulemaking committee, and announced that this committee would meet for three sessions. The sessions occurred in December 2017, February 2018, and March 2018. The Department of Education and negotiators failed to reach consensus on a revised rule, and on August 14, 2018, the Department of Education published in the Federal Register a proposed rule (the \u201cGainful Employment Proposed Rule\u201d) which, if enacted as a final rule, would rescind the current gainful employment regulations applicable to all of our educational programs. Among other things, the Gainful Employment Proposed Rule would remove from the Department of Education\u2019s regulations the debt-to-earnings metric calculations for our programs, and sanctions and alternate earnings appeals related to those calculations, and related reporting, disclosure, and certification requirements. In the Gainful Employment Proposed Rule, the Department of Education also seeks comment on whether all institutions participating in the federal student financial aid programs should be required to disclose net price, completion rates, withdrawal rates, program size, graduate eligibility for state licensure, or any other items currently required under the gainful employment regulations. Following a 30-day public comment period, the Department of Education is expected to issue a final rule by November 1, 2018, taking effect July 1, 2019. We cannot predict the extent to which that final rule may differ from the Gainful Employment Proposed Rule, or may differ from the current gainful employment regulations, or the impact that any such revised rule might have on our business.\nOn July 5, 2017, the Department of Education announced that it would allow additional time, until July 1, 2018, for institutions to comply with certain disclosure requirements in the gainful employment regulations. On June 15, 2018, the Department of Education further announced that it would allow more additional time, until July 1, 2019, for institutions to comply with those disclosure requirements. Continued compliance with the gainful employment regulations could increase our cost of doing business, reduce our enrollments and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe failure of any program or programs offered by NAU to satisfy any gainful employment regulations could render that program or programs ineligible for Title IV program funds. Additionally, any gainful employment data released by the Department of Education about our programs or warnings provided to students under the regulations could influence current students not to continue their studies, discourage prospective students from enrolling in our programs or negatively impact our reputation. If a particular educational program ceased to become eligible for Title IV program funds, either because it fails to prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation or due to other factors, we may choose to cease offering the program. We could also be required to make changes to certain programs in the future in order to comply with the regulations or to avoid the uncertainty associated with such compliance. Any of these factors could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be held liable for any misrepresentation regarding the nature of our educational programs, financial charges and financial assistance or the employability of our graduates.\nAn institution participating in Title IV programs is prohibited from making misrepresentations regarding the nature of its educational programs, the nature of financial charges and availability of financial assistance, or the employability of graduates. A misrepresentation is defined in the regulations as any false, erroneous or misleading statement to any student or prospective student, any member of the public, an accrediting agency, a state agency or the Department of Education. If we - or any entity, organization, or person with whom we have an agreement to provide educational programs or to provide marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services - commit a misrepresentation for which a person could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person\u2019s detriment, the Department of Education could initiate proceedings to revoke our Title IV eligibility, deny applications made by us, impose fines, or initiate a limitation, suspension or termination proceeding against us. Further, although the Department of Education claims not to have created any private right of action, the Department of Education\u2019s recent modifications to its misrepresentation regulations could increase risk of qui tam actions under the False Claims Act.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent activity in student enrollment and financial aid, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nInstitutions of higher education are susceptible to an increased risk of fraudulent activity by outside parties with respect to student enrollment and student financial aid programs. The Department of Education\u2019s regulations require institutions that participate in Title IV programs to refer to the Office of Inspector General credible information indicating that any applicant, employee, third-party servicer or agent of the institution that acts in a capacity that involves administration of the Title IV programs has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs. We cannot be certain that our systems and processes will always be adequate in the face of increasingly sophisticated and ever-changing fraud schemes. The potential for outside parties to perpetrate fraud in connection with the award and disbursement of Title IV program funds, including as a result of identity theft, may be heightened due to our offering various educational programs via distance education. Any significant failure by NAU to adequately detect fraudulent activity related to student enrollment and financial aid could result in loss of accreditation, which would result in the institution losing eligibility for Title IV programs, or in direct action by the Department of Education to limit or terminate NAU's Title IV program participation. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our students experience a loss or reduction of state financial aid, we could be materially affected.\nSome of our students rely on state financial aid to fund a portion of their education. Many states in which we operate have faced budget constraints, which have caused or may cause them to reduce or eliminate state appropriations, including with respect to the amount of financial assistance provided to postsecondary students, and additional states may reduce or eliminate such appropriations in the future. In addition, state financial aid programs generally are subject to annual appropriation by the state legislatures, which may eliminate or significantly decrease the amount of state financial aid available to students. We cannot predict whether future reductions in state financial aid programs will occur or how long such reductions will persist. For fiscal year ended May 31, 2018, we derived less than 1% of our total revenue from state financial aid programs, although the percentage derived by each of our campus locations may vary on an individual basis. The loss or reduction of state financial aid could decrease our student enrollment and could have a material effect on our business.\nA substantial decrease in private student financing options or a significant increase in financing costs for our students could have a material effect on us.\nSome of our eligible students have used private (i.e., non-Title IV) loan programs to fund a portion of their education costs not covered by Title IV program funds or state financial aid sources. Recent adverse market conditions for consumer and federally guaranteed student loans (including lenders\u2019 increasing difficulties in reselling or syndicating student loan portfolios) have resulted, and could continue to result, in providers of private loans reducing the availability of or increasing the costs associated with providing private loans to postsecondary students. In particular, loans to students with low credit scores who would not otherwise be eligible for credit-based private loans have become increasingly difficult to obtain. Prospective students may find that these increased financing costs make borrowing prohibitively expensive and abandon or delay enrollment in postsecondary education programs. If our students are unable to finance their education our student population could decrease, which would have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment and regulatory agencies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews, bring claims or initiate litigation against us.\nBecause we operate in a highly regulated industry, we may be subject to compliance reviews and claims of non-compliance and lawsuits by government agencies, regulatory agencies and third parties, including claims brought by third parties on behalf of the federal government. If the results of these reviews or proceedings are unfavorable to us, or if we are unable to defend successfully against lawsuits or claims, we may be required to pay money damages or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of eligibility for Title IV funding, injunctions or other penalties. Even if we adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim, we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those reviews or to defend against those lawsuits or claims. Additionally, we may experience adverse collateral consequences as a result of any negative publicity associated with such claims, including declines in student enrollments and lessened willingness of third parties to do business with us. Claims and lawsuits brought against us may damage our reputation or cost us to incur expenses, even if such claims and lawsuits are without merit.\nOur regulatory environment and our reputation may be negatively influenced by the actions of other postsecondary institutions.\nIn recent years, regulatory investigations and civil litigation have been commenced against several postsecondary educational institutions. These investigations and lawsuits have alleged, among other things, deceptive trade practices and non-compliance with Department of Education regulations. These allegations have attracted adverse media coverage and have been the subject of federal and state legislative hearings. Although the media, regulatory and legislative focus has been primarily on the allegations made against these specific companies, broader allegations against the overall postsecondary sector may negatively impact public perceptions of postsecondary educational institutions, including us. Such allegations could result in increased scrutiny and regulation by the Department of Education, U.S. Congress, accrediting bodies, state legislatures or other governmental authorities on all postsecondary institutions.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we continue to decline in revenue and profitability, we may not have adequate liquidity and capital resources to\nexecute our business plan.\nThe Company has experienced a decrease in revenue since 2013 due to enrollment declines at National American University, and this long-term decline in revenue has resulted in increasing net losses and decreases in our liquidity and capital resources. To counter the decrease in net losses, the Company consolidated students at thirteen locations into locations in the same market since the third quarter of 2017. Ten locations were consolidated in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. The reduction of overhead as the result of these campus consolidations, while maintaining student services, has positively impacted operating cash flow and cash balances. The recent formation of the College of Military Studies and the acquisition of academic programs in strategic security and related fields from Henley Putnam University also have positive impact on our enrollment.\nFor the year ended May 31, 2018, our cash used in operating activities was $3.7 million. As of May 31, 2018, the Company had $5.3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and negative working capital of $652 thousand, which may not be sufficient to fund our forecasted operating and cash requirements without additional financing or other actions by management. The following management actions occurred after May 31, 2018, the results of which management believes are probable of occurring and will be sufficient to meet its forecasted liquidity needs for the next twelve months from the issuance of the Company\u2019s financial statements:\n\u25cf\nThe Company has identified certain, non-revenue producing assets, specifically two aircraft that it will divest in order to further reduce operating expenses and support its liquidity needs. The estimated proceeds from the sale of the assets as well as the savings from the related maintenance and operating costs are approximately $2.3 million.\n\u25cf\nThe Company estimates a $3 million decrease in payroll expenses by eliminating positions through the reorganization of our enrollment function, which is now under one leadership team to provide transparency and accountability.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and competitors with greater resources could harm our business, decrease market share and put downward pressure on our tuition rates.\nThe postsecondary education market is highly fragmented and competitive. We compete for students with traditional public and private two-year and four- year colleges and universities, and other for-profit schools, including those that offer online learning programs, and alternatives to higher education, such as employment and military service. Many public and private schools, colleges and universities, including most major colleges and universities, offer online programs. We expect to experience additional competition in the future as more colleges, universities and for-profit schools offer an increasing number of online programs. Public institutions receive substantial government subsidies, and public and private non-profit institutions have access to government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions and other financial resources generally not available to for-profit schools. Accordingly, public and private nonprofit institutions may have instructional and support resources superior to those in the for-profit sector, and public institutions can offer substantially lower tuition prices. Some of our competitors in both the public and private sectors also have substantially greater financial and other resources than us. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and may face competitive pressures that could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur online and distance learning programs operate in a highly competitive market with rapid technological changes.\nOnline education is a highly fragmented and competitive market subject to rapid technological change. Competitors vary in size and organization from traditional colleges and universities, many of which offer some form of online education programs, to for-profit schools and software companies providing online education and training software. We expect the online education and training market to be subject to rapid changes in delivery, interaction and other future innovation and advancement. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to adapt to changing technologies in online and distance learning and offer an attractive online/distance education option while maintaining competitive pricing. Furthermore, the expansion of our online programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by the online education market. In addition, a general decline in Internet use for any reason, including due to security or privacy concerns, the cost of Internet service or changes in government regulation of Internet use, may result in less demand for online educational services, in which case we may not be able to recruit and retain students and grow our online programs as planned. Accordingly, if we are unable to keep pace with changes in technology or maintain technological relevance, or if the use of the Internet changes, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf our graduates are unable to obtain professional licenses or certifications in their chosen field of study, we may face declining enrollments and revenues or be subject to student litigation.\nCertain students, particularly in the healthcare programs, require or desire professional licenses or certifications after graduation to obtain employment in their chosen fields. Their success in obtaining such licensure depends on several factors, including the individual merits of the student, whether the institution and the program were approved by the state or by a professional association, whether the program from which the student graduated meets all state requirements and whether the institution is accredited. If one or more states refuses to recognize our graduates for professional licensure in the future based on factors relating to us or our programs, the potential growth of our programs would be negatively impacted, which could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we could be exposed to litigation that would force us to incur legal and other expenses that could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe payment and amount of future dividends is subject to Board of Director discretion and to various risks and uncertainties.\nThe payment and amount of future quarterly dividends is within the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on factors the Board deems relevant at the time declaration of a dividend is considered. These factors include, but are not limited to: available cash; management\u2019s expectations regarding future performance and free cash flow; and the effect of various risks and uncertainties described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nOur financial performance depends on our ability to continue to develop awareness among, and attract and retain, new students.\nBuilding awareness of NAU and the programs and services we offer is critical to our ability to attract prospective students. If we are unable to successfully market and advertise our educational programs, our ability to attract and enroll students could be adversely affected, and, consequently, our ability to increase revenue or generate profitability could be impaired. It is also critical to our success that we convert prospective students to enrolled students in a cost-effective manner and that these enrolled students remain active in our programs. Some of the factors that could prevent us from successfully enrolling and retaining students include:\n\u25cf\nthe reduced availability of, or higher interest rates and other costs associated with, Title IV loan funds or other sources of financial aid;\n\u25cf\nthe emergence of more successful competitors;\n\u25cf\nfactors related to our marketing, including the costs and effectiveness of Internet advertising and broad-based branding campaigns and recruiting efforts;\n\u25cf\nperformance problems with our online systems;\n\u25cf\nfailure to maintain institutional and specialized accreditations;\n\u25cf\nfailure to obtain and maintain required state authorizations;\n\u25cf\nthe requirements of the education agencies that regulate us that restrict the initiation of new locations, new programs and modification of existing programs;\n\u25cf\nthe requirements of the education agencies that regulate us that restrict the ways schools can compensate their recruitment personnel;\n\u25cf\nincreased regulation of online education, including in states in which we do not have a physical presence;\n\u25cf\nrestrictions that may be imposed on graduates of online programs that seek certification or licensure in certain states;\n\u25cf\nstudent dissatisfaction with our services and programs;\n\u25cf\nadverse publicity regarding us, our competitors, or online or for-profit education generally;\n\u25cf\nprice reductions by competitors that we are unwilling or unable to match;\n\u25cf\na decline in the acceptance of online education;\n\u25cf\nan adverse economic or other development that affects job prospects in our core disciplines;\n\u25cf\na decrease in the perceived or actual economic benefits that students derive from our programs;\n\u25cf\nlitigation or regulatory investigations that may damage our reputation; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in the general economy, including employment.\nIf, for any reason or reasons, including those presented above, we are unable to maintain and increase our awareness among prospective students, recruit students and convert prospective students into enrolled students, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur growth may place a strain on our resources that could adversely affect our systems, controls and operating efficiency.\nWe believe that future growth will be based upon an expansion of our current programs, the addition of new programs, an increase in our online presence, affiliation agreements and increasing enrollments. The growth and expansion of our domestic and international operations may place a significant strain on our resources and increase demands on our management information and reporting systems, financial management controls and personnel. Any failure to effectively manage or maintain growth could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we cannot maintain student enrollments, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur strategy for growth and profitability depends, in part, upon the retention of our students. While we provide certain services to our students (e.g., tutoring) in an effort to retain students and lower attrition rates, many of our students face financial, personal or family constraints that require them to withdraw within a term or at the end of a given term. Additionally, some students may decide to continue their education at a different institution. If for any reason, we are unable to predict and manage student attrition, our overall enrollment levels would likely decline, which could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the proportion of students who are enrolled in our Associate degree programs increases, we may experience increased costs and reduced margins.\nIf increases in Associate degree programs take effect, we may experience additional consequences, such as higher costs per start, lower retention rates, higher student services costs, an increase in the percentage of our revenue derived from Title IV programs under the 90/10 Rule, more limited ability to implement tuition price increases and other effects that could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn increase in interest rates could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain students.\nFor the fiscal years ended May 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, NAU derived cash receipts equal to approximately 82.1%, 82.6%, and 86.8%, respectively, of its net revenue from tuition financed under Title IV programs, which include student loans with interest rates subsidized by the federal government. Additionally, some students finance their education through private loans that are not subsidized. If our students\u2019 employment circumstances are adversely affected by regional or national economic downturns, they may be more heavily dependent on student loans. Interest rates have reached relatively low levels in recent years, creating a favorable borrowing environment for students. However, if interest rates increase or Congress decreases the amount available for Title IV funding, our students may have to pay higher interest rates on their loans. Any future increase in interest rates will result in a corresponding increase in educational costs to our existing and prospective students, which could result in a significant reduction in our student population and revenues. Higher interest rates could also contribute to higher default rates with respect to our students\u2019 repayment of their education loans. Higher default rates may in turn adversely impact our eligibility to participate in some or all of the Title IV programs, which could result in a material effect on our enrollments and future growth prospects and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reputation and the value of our stock may be negatively affected by the actions of other postsecondary educational institutions.\nIn recent years, regulatory proceedings and litigation have been commenced against various postsecondary educational institutions relating to, among other things, deceptive trade practices, false claims against the government and non-compliance with Department of Education requirements, state education laws and state consumer protection laws. These proceedings have been brought by students, the Department of Education, the United States Department of Justice, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and state governmental agencies, among others. These allegations have attracted adverse media coverage and have been the subject of legislative hearings and regulatory actions at both the federal and state levels, focusing not only on the individual schools but in some cases on the larger for-profit postsecondary education sector as a whole. Adverse media coverage regarding other for-profit education companies or other educational institutions could damage our reputation, result in lower enrollments, revenues and results of operations and have a negative impact on the value of our stock. Such coverage could also result in increased scrutiny and regulation by the Department of Education, Congress, accrediting commissions, state legislatures, state attorneys general, state education agencies or other governmental authorities of all educational institutions, including us.\nOur expansion into new markets outside the United States will subject us to risks inherent in international operations, are subject to significant start- up costs and will place strain on our management.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to continue to establish markets outside the United States, subject to approvals from the HLC and other appropriate accrediting or regulatory agencies. Our operations in each of the foreign jurisdictions may subject us to additional educational and other regulations of foreign jurisdictions, which may differ materially from the regulations applicable to our domestic operations. Such international expansion is expected to require a significant amount of start-up costs. Additionally, our management does not have significant experience in operating a business at the international level. As a result, we may be unsuccessful in carrying out our plans for international expansion, obtaining the necessary licensing, permits or market saturation, or in successfully navigating other challenges posed by operating an international business.\nIf we do not maintain existing and develop additional relationships with employers, our future growth may be impaired.\nCurrently, we have relationships with certain employers to provide their employees with an opportunity to enroll in classes and obtain degrees through us while maintaining their employment. These relationships are an important part of our strategy because they provide us with a steady source of potential working adult students for particular programs and increase our reputation among employers. If we are unable to develop new relationships or maintain our existing relationships, this source of potential students may be impaired and enrollments and revenue may decrease, any of which could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf students fail to pay their outstanding balances, our business may be harmed.\nFrom time to time, students may carry balances on portions of their education expense not covered by financial aid programs. These balances are unsecured and not guaranteed. Furthermore, disruptive economic events could adversely affect the ability or willingness of our former students to repay student loans, which may increase our student loan cohort default rate and require the devotion of increased time, attention and resources to manage these defaults. As a result, losses related to unpaid student balances in excess of the amounts we have reserved for bad debts, or the failure of students to repay their debt obligations, could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment regulations relating to the Internet could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to grow.\nThe increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other online services has led and may lead to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the United States or foreign countries and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. These new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as online privacy, copyrights, trademarks and service marks, sales taxes, fair business practices and the requirement that online education institutions qualify to do business as foreign corporations or be licensed in one or more jurisdictions where they have no physical location. As the proportion of our students who take online courses increases, new laws, regulations or interpretations related to doing business over the Internet could increase our costs of compliance or doing business and materially affect our ability to offer online courses, which would have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to keep pace with changing market needs.\nIncreasingly, prospective employers of NAU students require their new employees to possess appropriate technological skills and interpersonal skills, such as communication, critical thinking and teamwork skills. These skills evolve rapidly in a changing economic and technological environment. Accordingly, it is important for our programs to evolve in response to those economic and technological changes. The expansion of existing programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by current or prospective students or the employers of our graduates. Even if NAU is able to develop acceptable new programs, we may not be able to begin offering those new programs as quickly as required by prospective employers or as quickly as our competitors offer similar programs. In addition, we may be unable to obtain specialized accreditations or licensures that may make certain programs desirable to students. To offer a new academic program, NAU may be required to obtain appropriate federal, state and accrediting agency approvals that may be conditioned or delayed in a manner that could significantly affect our growth plans. In addition, to be eligible for Title IV programs, a new academic program may need to be approved by the Department of Education, the HLC and state educational agencies. If we are unable to adequately respond to changes in market requirements due to regulatory or financial constraints, unusually rapid technological changes or other factors, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired, the rates at which our graduates obtain jobs involving their fields of study could suffer and our reputation among students, prospective students and employers may be impaired, which could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEstablishing new academic programs or modifying existing programs requires us to invest in management and business development, incur marketing expenses and reallocate other resources. We may have limited experience with any courses in new academic areas and may need to modify our systems, strategy and delivery platform or enter into arrangements with other educational institutions to provide such programs effectively and profitably. If we are unable to offer new courses and programs in a cost-effective manner, or are otherwise unable to effectively manage the operations of newly established academic programs, it could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCapacity constraints of our computer networks and changes to the acceptance and regulation of online programs could have a material effect on student retention and growth.\nIf we are successful in increasing student enrollments, additional resources in the forms of human, intellectual and financial capital, as well as information technology resources, will be necessary. We have invested and continue to invest significant resources in information technology when such technology systems and tools have become impaired or obsolete. In an attempt to utilize recent technology, we could install new information technology systems without accurately assessing its costs or benefits or experience delayed or ineffective implementation of new information technology systems. Similarly, we could fail to respond in a timely or sufficiently competitive way to future technological developments in our industry. As a result, this growth may place a significant strain on our operational resources, including our computer networks and information technology infrastructure, thereby restricting our ability to enroll and retain students and grow our online programs.\nSystem disruptions and security threats to our computer networks could have a material effect on our ability to attract and retain students.\nThe performance and reliability of our computer network infrastructure is critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain students. Any computer system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in traffic on our computer networks, including those that host our online programs, may cause network outages and disrupt our online and on-ground operations that may damage our reputation.\nAdditionally, we face a number of threats to our computer systems, including unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses and other security problems and system disruptions. We have devoted and will continue to devote significant resources to the security of our computer systems, but they are still vulnerable to security threats. A user or hacker who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations. As a result, we expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these system disruptions and security breaches and may have to spend more to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches, which could have a material effect on our reputation, ability to retain and store data and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure of our information systems to store, process and report relevant data may reduce management\u2019s effectiveness, interfere with regulatory compliance and increase operating expenses.\nWe are heavily dependent on the integrity of our data management systems. If these systems do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies or human error, our ability to plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations, including the Higher Education Act, will be impaired. Any such impairment of our information systems could materially affect our reputation and our ability to provide student services or accurately budget or forecast operating activity, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe personal information that we collect may be vulnerable to breach, theft or loss, and could subject us to liability or adversely affect our reputation and operations.\nPossession and use of personal information in our operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business and reputation. We collect, use and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our students and their families, including social security numbers, tax return information, personal and family financial data and credit card numbers. We also collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of business. Some of this personal information is held and managed by certain of our vendors. Although we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information, a third party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, which could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. In addition, errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. Possession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to U.S. federal and state legislative and regulatory burdens that could require us to implement certain policies and procedures, such as the procedures we adopted to comply with the Red Flags Rule that was promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, which requires the establishment of guidelines and policies regarding identity theft related to student credit accounts, and could require us to make certain notifications of data breaches and restrict our use of personal information. The risk of hacking and cyber-attacks has increased, as has the sophistication of such attacks, including email phishing schemes targeting employees to give up their credentials. We cannot provide any assurances that a breach, loss, or theft of personal information will not occur. A breach, theft, or loss of personal information regarding our students and their families or our employees that is held by us or our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations and result in liability under U.S. federal and state privacy statutes and legal actions by state authorities and private litigants, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, certain of our operations may involve the collection of personal information from individuals outside the U.S., which may render us subject to global privacy and data security laws. For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became enforceable May 25, 2018, contains a number of requirements that are different from or exceed those in U.S. federal and state privacy and data security laws. The GDPR may apply to certain of our operations. Were it to apply and if we were out of compliance, there is the potential for administrative, civil, or criminal liability with significant monetary penalties as well as reputational harm to us and our employees.\nWe may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of class materials posted online for class discussions.\nIn some instances, our faculty members or students may distribute to students in class or post various articles or other third-party content on class discussion boards. We may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of this material distributed in class or posted online for class discussions. As a for-profit organization, we may be subject to a greater risk of liability for the unauthorized duplication of materials under the Copyright Act than a non-profit institution of higher education. Third parties may raise claims against us for the unauthorized duplication of this material. Any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on financial resources and management personnel, regardless of whether the claims have merit. Our general liability insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter the content of our courses or pay monetary damages, which could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on exclusive proprietary rights and intellectual property that may not be adequately protected under current laws.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property. We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, domain names and contractual agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We rely on trademark protection in both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions to protect our rights to various marks, as well as distinctive logos and other marks associated with them. We also rely on agreements under which we obtain intellectual property or license rights to own or use content developed by faculty members, content experts and other third-parties. We cannot assure that these measures are adequate, that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate protections for all of our proprietary rights in the United States or any foreign jurisdictions, or that third parties will not terminate license rights or infringe upon or otherwise violate our proprietary rights. Despite our efforts to protect these rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to infringe our trademarks, use, duplicate or copy the proprietary aspects of our student recruitment and educational delivery methods, curricula, online resource material and other content. Our management\u2019s attention may be diverted by these attempts and we have in the past, and may in the future, need to use funds in litigation to protect our proprietary rights against any infringement or violation, which could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be involved in disputes from time to time relating to our intellectual property and the intellectual property of third parties.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, become parties to disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, and we may not always prevail in these disputes. Third parties may allege that we have not obtained sufficient rights in the content of a course or other intellectual property. Third parties may also raise claims against us alleging infringement or violation of the intellectual property of that third party. Some third party intellectual property rights may be extremely broad, and it may not be possible for us to conduct our operations in such a way as to avoid violating those intellectual property rights. Any such intellectual property claim could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether such claim has merit. Our general liability and cyber liability insurance, if any, may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter the content of our courses or pay monetary damages or license fees to third parties, which could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to retain key personnel or hire and retain the personnel we need to sustain and grow our business.\nOur success depends largely on the skills, efforts and motivations of our executive officers, who have significant experience with our business and within the education industry. Due to the nature of the education industry, we face significant competition in attracting and retaining personnel who possess the skills necessary to sustain and grow our business. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced faculty members and staff members on acceptable terms, could impair our ability to sustain and grow our business.\nOur business may be affected by changing economic conditions.\nThe United States economy and the economies of other key industrialized countries currently have recessionary characteristics, including reduced economic activity, increased unemployment and substantial uncertainty about the financial markets. In addition, homeowners in the United States have experienced an unprecedented reduction in wealth due to the decline in residential real estate values across much of the country. The reduction in wealth, unavailability of credit and unwillingness of employers to sponsor non-traditional educational opportunities for their employees could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war, natural disasters or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, tornadoes and other natural disasters or breaches of security at our educational sites could disrupt our operations. Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war, natural disasters or breaches of security that directly impact our physical facilities, online offerings or ability to recruit and retain students and employees could adversely affect our ability to deliver our programs to our students and, thereby, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war, natural disasters or breaches of security could adversely affect the economy and demographics of the affected region, which could cause significant declines in the number of our students in that region and could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 93399, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "NAUH"}
