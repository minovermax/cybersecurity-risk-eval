{"cik": "1103601", "company": "WGL HOLDINGS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-11-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risk factors described below should be read in conjunction with other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K, including an in-depth discussion of these risks in the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nThe risk factors discussed below are separated into three sections. The first discusses those factors that affect the consolidated entity of WGL Holdings and all of its subsidiaries, including Washington Gas. The second section describes other risk factors affecting Washington Gas included under \u201cRisks Affecting Washington Gas.\" The final section focuses on those factors affecting non-utility entities.\nRISKS RELATING TO WGL AND ALL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nThe merger with AltaGas may not achieve its anticipated results, and WGL may be unable to integrate the operations of AltaGas in the manner expected.\nWGL and AltaGas entered into the Merger Agreement with the expectation that the merger will result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses of WGL and AltaGas can be integrated in an efficient, effective and timely manner. The combination of two independent businesses is complex, costly and time-consuming and may divert significant management attention and resources to combining WGL\u2019s and AltaGas\u2019 business practices and operations, which could otherwise have been devoted to WGL\u2019s business opportunities. This process may disrupt WGL\u2019s and AltaGas\u2019 respective businesses.\nIn addition, it is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the disruption of WGL\u2019s businesses, processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices and policies, any of which could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger as and when expected. The overall combination of WGL\u2019s and AltaGas\u2019 businesses may also result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses and loss of customer and other business relationships. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits or the incurrence of unanticipated expenses and liabilities could materially adversely affect WGL\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and prospects, as well as that of the combined company.\nUncertainties associated with the merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees, which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company.\nWGL and AltaGas are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their officers and other key employees to execute their respective business plans. The combined company\u2019s success will depend in part upon its ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees of WGL and AltaGas. Current and prospective employees of WGL and AltaGas may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company, which may materially adversely affect the ability of each of WGL and AltaGas to attract and retain key personnel going forward. WGL may also have difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to retain key management personnel and other key employees of WGL and AltaGas, which could materially adversely affect WGL\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWGL may incur unexpected transaction fees and merger-related costs in connection with the merger.\nWGL expects to incur a number of non-recurring expenses associated with consummating the merger, as well as expenses related to combining the operations of the two companies. WGL may incur additional unanticipated costs in the integration of the businesses of WGL and AltaGas. Although WGL expects that the elimination of certain duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses, will offset the incremental transaction and merger-related costs over time, the combined company may not achieve this net benefit in the near term, or at all.\nWGL may encounter unexpected difficulties or costs in meeting commitments made under various orders and agreements associated with regulatory approvals for the merger.\nAs a result of the process to obtain regulatory approvals required for the merger, WGL is committed to various programs, contributions and investments in several agreements and regulatory approval orders. It is possible that WGL may encounter delays, unexpected difficulties or additional costs in meeting these commitments in compliance with the terms of the relevant agreements and orders. Failure to fulfill the commitments in accordance with their terms could result in increased costs or result in penalties or fines that could materially adversely affect WGL\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nWGL and AltaGas may become targets of securities class action suits and derivative suits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management attention and resources.\nSecurities class action suits and derivative suits are often brought against companies who have entered into mergers and acquisition transactions. There can be no assurance that WGL or AltaGas will not be targets of such suits in the future, and no guarantee that WGL or AltaGas can successfully defend against any such actions. Defending against these claims, even if meritless, could result in substantial costs to WGL and AltaGas and could divert the attention of management.\nA downgrade in WGL\u2019s or AltaGas\u2019 credit ratings could negatively affect WGL\u2019s cost of and ability to access capital.\nWGL\u2019s ability to obtain adequate and cost-effective financing depends in part on its credit ratings. A negative change in its ratings outlook or any downgrade in its current investment-grade credit ratings by the rating agencies, particularly below investment grade, could adversely affect WGL\u2019s costs of borrowing and/or access to sources of liquidity and capital. Further, a negative change in AltaGas\u2019 ratings outlook or any downgrade in its credit ratings could negatively impact WGL\u2019s ratings outlook or downgrade its credit ratings. Such downgrades could limit WGL\u2019s access to the credit markets and increase the costs of borrowing under available credit lines. Should WGL\u2019s credit ratings be downgraded, the interest rate on its borrowings under its existing credit facilities and commercial paper program, as well as on any future public or private debt issuances, would increase. An increase in borrowing costs without the ability to recover these higher costs in the rates charged to WGL\u2019s customers, which would be impacted by the merger-related commitment that prohibits Washington Gas from recovering any incremental financing costs due to a credit downgrade, could adversely affect earnings or cash flows by limiting WGL\u2019s ability to earn its allowed rate of return. And if WGL falls below investment grade, WGL may need to obtain additional credit support which may include obtaining a parent guarantee from AltaGas.\nWGL may be unable to access capital or the cost of capital may significantly increase.\nWGL\u2019s ability to obtain adequate and cost-effective financing is dependent upon the liquidity of the financial markets, in addition to its credit ratings. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets or waning investor sentiment could adversely affect WGL\u2019s ability to access short-term and long-term capital. WGL\u2019s access to funds under its commercial paper program is dependent on investor demand for its commercial paper. Disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets could limit the demand for WGL\u2019s commercial paper or result in the need to offer higher interest rates to investors, which would result in higher expense and could adversely impact liquidity.\nAs a subsidiary of AltaGas, WGL also may become a party to AltaGas\u2019 existing debt arrangements or rely on access to short-term intercompany borrowings. The inability to access adequate capital or the increase in cost of capital may require WGL to conserve cash, prevent or delay WGL from making capital expenditures, require WGL to reduce or eliminate distributions to AltaGas or other discretionary uses of cash or could negatively affect its future growth or earnings. A significant reduction in WGL\u2019s liquidity could cause a negative change in its ratings outlook or even a reduction in its credit ratings. This could in turn further limit WGL\u2019s access to credit markets and increase its costs of borrowing.\nAs an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of AltaGas, WGL is affected by AltaGas\u2019 strategic decisions and performance.\nAs an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of AltaGas, WGL\u2019s business and operating performance can be affected by a wide range of strategic decisions that AltaGas may make from time to time. Significant changes in AltaGas\u2019 strategy, its relationship with WGL, as well as material adverse changes in the performance of AltaGas, could have a material adverse effect on WGL\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nChanges to government fiscal and trade policies and state/local renewable energy mandates could adversely affect WGL\u2019s strategic decisions and operating performance.\nAny changes in the US trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected companies resulting in increased costs for goods used in our normal course of business, such as solar panels and steel pipe. Additionally, state and local initiatives adopting or increasing renewable portfolio standards could result in lower demand of natural gas due to mandatory or voluntary efforts.\nWGL is a holding company and we depend on the receipt of dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to pay dividends to our parent company and to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt.\nWGL is a holding company whose assets consist primarily of investments in subsidiaries. Accordingly, we conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries. Our ability to pay dividends to our parent company and to pay principal and accrued interest on our outstanding debt depends on the payment of dividends to us by certain of our subsidiaries or the repayment of funds to us by our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries, in turn, may be restricted from paying dividends, making repayments or making other distributions to us for financial, regulatory, legal or other reasons. The extent to which our subsidiaries are not able to pay dividen\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nds or repay funds to us may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to our parent company and principal and interest to holders of our debt.\nIf we are unable to access sources of liquidity or capital, or if the cost of funds increases significantly, our business, financial results and strategic growth plans may be adversely affected.\nWGL and Washington Gas require access to sources of liquidity to fund our operations and to support our growth strategy. Our ability to obtain adequate and cost-effective financing depends on the credit ratings of WGL and Washington Gas and the liquidity of financial markets. A material downgrade in WGL\u2019s or Washington Gas\u2019 credit ratings or disruptions in the credit market, including as a result of natural disasters and catastrophic events (including terrorist acts), could adversely affect our access to sources of liquidity and increase our borrowing costs.\nOur strategic growth plans assume that we will have continued access to liquidity and capital. In addition, the ability of our non-utility subsidiaries to purchase natural gas and electricity from their suppliers is partly dependent upon the creditworthiness of WGL, and upon access to cash collateral through the issuance of commercial paper and unsecured short-term bank loans by WGL. If WGL\u2019s credit ratings are materially downgraded, we may be required to provide additional credit support. If we are required to provide significant additional credit support, or if there is significant disruption in the credit markets, our ability to implement our strategic plans and the ability of our non-utility subsidiaries to make commodity purchases at reasonable prices may be impaired.\nCyber-attacks, including cyber-terrorism or other information technology security breaches, or information technology failures may disrupt our business operations, increase our costs, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage our reputation.\nSecurity breaches of our information technology infrastructure, including cyber-attacks and cyber-terrorism, or other failures of our information technology infrastructure could lead to disruptions of our natural gas distribution operations and otherwise adversely impact our ability to safely and effectively operate our pipeline and distributed generation systems and serve our customers. In addition, an attack on or failure of information technology systems could result in the unauthorized release of customer, employee or Company data that is crucial to our operational security or could adversely affect our ability to deliver and collect on customer bills. Such security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could adversely affect our business reputation, diminish customer confidence, subject us to financial liability or increased regulation, increase our costs and expose us to material legal claims and liability and adversely affect our operations and financial results. We have implemented preventive, detective and remediation measures to manage these risks, and we maintain cyber risk insurance to mitigate the effects of these events. Nevertheless, these may not effectively protect all of our systems all of the time. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these cyber-events is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect WGL\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAs an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of AltaGas, WGL is dependent on AltaGas for certain services under a services agreement. Loss of such services, if any, could have a material impact on WGL\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWGL receives general corporate services from AltaGas under a service agreement approved by SCC of VA. Under the agreement, WGL relies on AltaGas for certain administrative and management functions and services, including human resources, employee benefits, finance, legal, accounting, tax, information technology, and office services. Should AltaGas not be able to provide such services to WGL for any reason, WGL will need to utilize its own resources for such services or otherwise find a substitute provider for such services. WGL, however, may not have sufficient internal resources to effectively provide such services or may not be able to contract with a substitute service provider on similar terms or at all. Moreover, the costs of obtaining a substitute service provider, if found, may also be substantial and overly burdensome for WGL. WGL may also experience an interruption in the provision of such services to it. In addition, in light of AltaGas' familiarity with WGL, a substitute service provider, if any, may not be able to provide the same level of service due to lack of preexisting synergies. If WGL cannot support necessary services from its internal resources or otherwise locate providers that are able to provide it with substantially similar services, WGL\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to meet our customers\u2019 requirements may be impaired if contracted supply is not available, if supplies are not delivered in a timely manner, if we lose key suppliers or if we are not able to obtain additional supplies during significant spikes in demand.\nWashington Gas must acquire adequate natural gas supply and pipeline and storage capacity to meet current and future customers\u2019 annual and seasonal natural gas requirements. Similarly, WGL Energy Services requires adequate natural gas and\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nelectric supplies to serve the demands of its customers and WGL Midstream requires adequate natural gas supply and storage and pipeline capacity to meet its delivery obligations to its customers. We depend on the ability of natural gas producers, pipeline gatherers, natural gas processors, interstate pipelines, suppliers of electricity and regional electric transmission operators to meet these requirements. If we are unable to secure adequate supplies in a timely manner because of a failure of our suppliers to deliver the contracted commodity, capacity or storage, if we are unable to secure additional quantities during significant abnormal weather conditions, or if Washington Gas' or WGL Energy Services' interruptible customers fail to comply with requests to curtail their gas usage during periods of sustained cold weather, we may be unable to meet our customers\u2019 requirements. Such inability could result in defaults under contracts with customers, penalties and financial damage payments, costs relating to procedures to recover from a disruption of service, the loss of key licenses and operating authorities, and the loss of customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nNatural disasters and catastrophic events, including terrorist acts, may adversely affect our business.\nNatural disasters and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornados, terrorist acts, and other similar occurrences, could damage our operational assets, including utility facilities, information technology infrastructure, distributed generation assets and pipeline assets owned by investees of our non-utility subsidiaries. Such events could likewise damage the operational assets of our suppliers or customers. These events could disrupt our ability to meet customer requirements, significantly increase our response costs, and significantly decrease our revenues. Unanticipated events or a combination of events, failure in resources needed to respond to events, or a slow or inadequate response to events may have an adverse impact on our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The availability of insurance covering catastrophic events, sabotage and terrorism may be limited or may result in higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms.\nWe are exposed to counterparty and contract-related risks that could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe extend credit to counterparties, including other utilities, holding companies, banks, gas exploration and production companies, government-backed utilities and other participants in the energy industry. Although we believe we have prudent policies in place to manage our credit risk, including credit policies, netting arrangements and margining provisions incorporated in contractual agreements, we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nIn addition, we enter into agreements with counterparties relating to the sale, purchase and delivery of commodity, transportation capacity, energy system design and construction, investment terms, and other matters. Our decisions to enter into these agreements are based on our expectations about the ongoing viability of our counterparties, assumptions and expectations underlying pricing terms and conditions, and commercial terms and other matters. These expectations may prove to be incorrect or our counterparties may dispute key terms of our agreements in ways that we do not anticipate. Such developments could result in our incurring losses or otherwise not achieving anticipated financial returns, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We are currently involved in legal proceedings with Antero Resources (Antero) relating to a dispute over the gas being delivered under natural gas purchase contracts. To date, WGL Midstream has incurred losses associated with this dispute of approximately $29.6 million. Separately, Antero has initiated suit against Washington Gas and WGL Midstream, claiming that they have failed to purchase specified daily quantities of gas and seeking alleged cover damages exceeding $100 million as of April 4, 2018, according to Antero's complaint. Washington Gas and WGL Midstream oppose both the validity and amount of Antero\u2019s claim. If we are not successful in these proceedings, our results of operations would be negatively affected.\nOur risk management strategies and related hedging activities may not be effective in managing risks and may cause increased volatility in our earnings and, in our utility segment, may result in costs and losses for which rate recovery may be disallowed.\nWe are exposed to commodity price, weather and interest rate risks. In addition, WGL Energy Services is exposed to pricing of certain ancillary services provided by the power pool in which it operates.\nFor gas purchases to serve utility customers, Washington Gas attempts to manage its exposure to these risks, in part, through regulatory recovery mechanisms. Our other subsidiaries primarily seek to manage risks by matching natural gas and electricity purchase obligations with sales commitments in terms of volume and pricing. In addition, we attempt to mitigate risks by hedging, setting risk limits and employing other risk management tools and procedures. These risk management activities may not be effective and cannot eliminate these risks in their entirety. If these tools and procedures are ineffective, we could incur significant losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and liquidity. In addition, although Washington Gas generally anticipates rate recovery of its costs or losses incurred in connection with these risk management\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nactivities, a regulator could subsequently disallow these costs or losses from the determination of revenues, which could adversely affect our financial results and increase the volatility of our earnings.\nRules implementing the derivatives transaction provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act regulates derivatives transactions, which include certain instruments, such as interest rate swaps, and commodity options, financial and other contracts, used in our risk management activities. The Dodd-Frank Act requires that most swaps be cleared through a registered clearing facility and that they be traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility, with certain exceptions for entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. The Dodd-Frank requirements relating to derivative transactions have not been fully implemented by the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. When fully implemented, the law and any new regulations could increase the operational and transactional cost of derivatives contracts and affect the number and/or creditworthiness of available counterparties.\nIn addition, we may transact with counterparties based in the European Union, Canada or other jurisdictions which, like the U.S., are in the process of implementing regulations to regulate derivatives transactions, some of which are currently in effect and may impose costs on our derivatives activities.\nOur business, earnings and cash requirements are highly weather sensitive and seasonal.\nThe earnings of Washington Gas can vary from year to year depending, in part, on weather conditions. Warmer-than-normal weather can reduce our utility margins as customer consumption declines. In Maryland and Virginia, we have in place regulatory mechanisms and rate designs intended to stabilize the level of net revenues that we collect from customers by eliminating the effect of deviations in customer usage caused by variations in weather from normal levels, and other factors such as conservation. If our rates and tariffs are modified to eliminate these provisions, then we would be exposed to significant risk associated with weather.\nThe operations of WGL Energy Services, our retail energy-marketing subsidiary, are weather sensitive and seasonal, with a significant portion of revenues derived from the sale of natural gas to retail customers for space heating during the winter months, and from the sale of electricity to retail customers for cooling during the summer months. Weather conditions directly influence the volume of natural gas and electricity delivered to customers. Weather conditions can also affect the short-term pricing of energy supplies that WGL Energy Services may need to procure to meet the needs of its customers. Similarly, the business of WGL Midstream is seasonal due to the tendency of storage and transportation spreads to increase during the winter. In addition, the distributed generation operations of WGL Energy Systems, which derive significant revenues from the sale of electricity to customers from solar generating assets, are weather sensitive because weather conditions directly influence the generation of electricity that is delivered to customers.\nDeviations from normal weather conditions and the seasonal nature of these businesses can create large fluctuations in these subsidiaries\u2019 short-term cash requirements and earnings.\nWashington Gas and WGL Midstream may face regulatory and financial risks related to pipeline safety legislation.\nA number of proposals to require increased oversight over pipeline operations and increased investment in and inspections of pipeline facilities are pending or have previously been proposed in the United States Congress. Additional operating expenses and capital expenditures may be necessary to remain in compliance with the increased federal oversight resulting from such proposals. While we cannot predict with certainty the extent of these expenses and expenditures or when they will become effective, the adoption of such proposals could result in significant additional costs to Washington Gas\u2019 and WGL Midstream\u2019s businesses. Washington Gas may be unable to recover from customers through the regulatory process all or some of these costs and may be unable to earn its authorized rate of return on these costs.\nFailure of our service providers could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our information technology, customer service, supply chain, pipeline and infrastructure installation and maintenance, engineering, payroll and human resources functions that we rely on are provided by third-party vendors. Some of these services may be provided by vendors from centers located outside of the United States. Services provided pursuant to these agreements could be disrupted due to events and circumstances beyond our control. Our reliance on these service providers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Tax Act could adversely affect WGL.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Act, which significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. While WGL has made an initial assessment of the impacts of the Tax Act on it and its subsidiaries, it\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nremains unknown at this time how the Treasury Department may interpret certain provisions of the Tax Act. These interpretations could have a negative impact on the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition of WGL and its subsidiaries.\nThe Tax Act may impact WGL\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards.\nThe Tax Act includes a limitation on the utilization of net operating losses beginning October 1, 2018 to 80% of current year taxable income and eliminates any NOL carrybacks. Such net operating losses have an unlimited carryforward. These provisions may affect the timing of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and investment tax credit carryforwards.\nRISKS RELATING TO WASHINGTON GAS\nChanges in the regulatory environment or unfavorable rate regulation may restrict or delay Washington Gas\u2019 ability to earn a reasonable rate of return on its capital invested to provide utility service and to recover fully its operating costs.\nWashington Gas is regulated by several regulatory commissions and agencies. These regulatory commissions generally have authority over many of the activities of Washington Gas\u2019 business including, but not limited to, the rates it charges to its customers, the amount and type of securities it can issue, the nature of investments it can make, the nature and quality of services it provides, safety standards, collection practices and other matters. These regulators also may modify Washington Gas\u2019 rates to change the level, type and methods that it utilizes to recover its costs, including the costs to acquire, store, transport and deliver natural gas. In addition, the regulatory environment and rate regulation can be affected by new laws and political considerations. Most significantly, we incur both planned and unplanned costs to operate, improve, maintain and repair our operational assets. The amount of these costs may vary from our expectations due to significant unanticipated repairs, maintenance and remediation of our assets, changes in legal and regulatory requirements, natural disasters, terrorism, changes in interest rates of our indebtedness and other events. To the extent these costs are not included in approved rates or tariffs, we seek our recovery through rate cases; however, the regulatory process may be lengthy and costs may be disallowed, causing us to suffer the negative financial effects of costs incurred without the benefit of rate relief. Additionally, the actions of regulatory commissions may restrict or delay Washington Gas\u2019 ability to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital.\nWashington Gas must acquire additional capacity to deliver natural gas into growth areas and it may not be able to do so in a timely manner.\nWashington Gas must acquire additional interstate pipeline transportation or storage capacity and construct transmission and distribution pipe to deliver additional capacity into growth areas on our system. The specific timing of any larger customer additions to our market may not be forecasted with sufficiently long lead time and the availability of these supply options to serve any of our customer additions may be limited by market supply and demand, the timing of Washington Gas\u2019 participation in new interstate pipeline construction projects, local permitting requirements and the ability to acquire necessary rights of way. These limitations could result in an interruption in Washington Gas\u2019 ability to satisfy the needs of some of its customers.\nLeaks, mechanical problems, incidents or other operational issues could affect public safety and the reliability of Washington Gas\u2019 distribution system, which could materially affect Washington Gas\u2019 results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWashington Gas\u2019 business is exposed to operational issues, hazards and risks inherent in storing and transporting natural gas that could affect the public safety and reliability of its distribution system. While Washington Gas, with support from each of its regulatory commissions, is accelerating the replacement of aging pipeline infrastructure prioritized on a risk-based approach, there are potential operating issues. These issues such as leaks, equipment problems and incidents, including explosions and fire, could result in legal liability, repair and remediation costs, increased operating costs, significant increased capital expenditures, regulatory fines and penalties and other costs and a loss of customer confidence. Any liabilities resulting from the occurrence of these events may not be fully covered by insurance, and Washington Gas may be unable to recover from customers through the regulatory process all of these repair, remediation and other costs and earn its authorized rate of return on these costs.\nWashington Gas has implemented preventive and remedial measures to address increased leak rates in its distribution system caused by an increase in the volume of natural gas containing low concentration of HHCs received from its suppliers. These measures include the injection of hexane to increase the concentration of HHCs and the implementation of pipe replacement programs. If Washington Gas were unable to inject hexane into its natural gas supply due to limited availability of hexane, equipment or operational problems, or damage to our facilities at which hexane is injected, our leak rates could increase, which\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nwould exacerbate the risks discussed above. In addition, Washington Gas\u2019 ability to continue to recover the cost of these preventive and remedial measures and to earn its authorized rate of return on these costs is subject to the regulatory process.\nCurrent and future environmental regulations may adversely affect Washington Gas\u2019 operations and financial results.\nWashington Gas is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations related to environmental matters. These evolving laws and regulations may require expenditures over a long timeframe. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may expose Washington Gas to fines, penalties and operational interruptions that could adversely affect its financial results. Moreover, new environmental requirements, revisions and reinterpretations of existing environmental requirements and changes in environmental enforcement policies and practices may stretch Washington Gas\u2019 operational resources and adversely affect its financial results.\nIn the past, the United States Congress has considered legislative proposals to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Future proposals to limit GHG emissions could adversely affect our operating and service costs and demand for our product. Should future proposals become law, operating and service costs may increase and demand for our product could decrease, and utility costs and prices charged to utility customers may increase, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in the relative prices of alternative forms of energy may weaken the competitive position of Washington Gas\u2019 delivery service, which could reduce growth in natural gas customers, reduce the volume of natural gas delivered and negatively affect Washington Gas\u2019 cash flows and earnings.\nThe price of natural gas delivery service that Washington Gas provides competes with the price of other forms of energy such as electricity, oil and propane. An increase in the price of natural gas compared to other sources of energy may cause the competitive position of our natural gas delivery service to decline. A decline in the competitive position of natural gas service may lead to fewer natural gas customers, lower volumes of natural gas delivered, lower cash flows and lower earnings.\nA decline in the local economy in which Washington Gas operates may reduce net revenue growth and reduce future earnings and cash flows.\nApproximately 71% of our assets are attributable to our regulated utility businesses, and the dividends paid by Washington Gas to WGL constituted approximately 84% of the amount of WGL Holdings' dividends paid for fiscal year 2018. Further, substantially all of our natural gas utility customers are located in Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia. A decline in the economy of the region in which Washington Gas operates or a change in the usage patterns and financial condition of customers in the region might adversely affect Washington Gas\u2019 ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from existing customers, which may negatively affect net revenue growth and increase costs.\nWashington Gas\u2019 business and financial condition could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages by its unionized employees.\nWashington Gas\u2019 business is dependent upon employees who are represented by unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Disputes with the unions could result in work stoppages that could impact the delivery of natural gas and other services, which could affect our relationships with customers, vendors and regulators and adversely affect Washington Gas\u2019 business and financial condition.\nThe availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation capacity and natural gas supply may decrease.\nWe purchase almost all of our natural gas supply from interstate sources that must then be transported to our service territory. In particular, while the Marcellus Shale region is rapidly developing as a premier gas formation, the interstate pipeline transportation capacity may limit the availability of gas from the Marcellus Shale region in the near term. A significant disruption to or reduction in interstate pipeline capacity due to events such as operational failures or disruptions, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, freeze off of natural gas wells, terrorist or cyber-attacks or other acts of war, or legislative or regulatory actions or requirements, including remediation related to integrity inspections, could reduce our normal interstate supply of gas, which may affect our ability to serve customer demand and may reduce our earnings.\nThe cost of providing retirement plan benefits to eligible current and former employees is subject to changes in the performance of investments, demographics, and other factors and assumptions. These changes may have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe cost of providing retirement plan benefits to eligible current and former employees is subject to changes in the market value of our retirement plan assets, changing bond yields, changing demographics and changing assumptions. Any sustained declines in equity markets, reductions in bond yields, increases in health care cost trends, or increases in life expectancy of beneficiaries may have an adverse effect on our retirement plan liabilities assets and benefit costs. Additionally, we may be\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nrequired to increase our contributions in future periods in order to preserve the current level of benefits under the plans and/or due to federal funding requirements.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE NON-UTILITY SUBSIDIARIES OF WGL\nThe construction of WGL Midstream\u2019s pipeline assets have experienced and may continue to experience legislative and regulatory obstacles, and the construction and operation of these assets are subject to hazards, equipment failures, supply chain disruptions, personnel issues and related risks, which could result in decreased values of these investments, including impairments, and/or delays their in-service dates, which would negatively affect our results of operations.\nWGL Midstream\u2019s business plan involves making substantial investments in pipeline construction projects, which are subject to FERC and state agency regulation and approval. These construction projects are also subject to environmental, political and legal uncertainties that are beyond our control. These factors may reduce some opportunities to grow our midstream business or impair our existing investments.\nIn addition, the construction and operation of WGL Midstream\u2019s pipeline assets are subject to risks relating to breakdowns or failures of equipment or processes due to pipeline integrity, fuel supply or transportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages, construction delays or cost overruns, and shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor. Because these assets are interconnected with facilities of third parties, the operation of these facilities could also be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties. These events could further delay the in-service date of WGL Midstream\u2019s projects or disrupt operations on these projects, which could have an adverse effect on its financial results.\nReturns on our non-utility subsidiaries\u2019 investments in renewable energy projects are dependent upon regulatory and tax incentives, which may expire or be reduced or modified.\nWGL Energy Systems derives a significant portion of its revenues from the sale of solar renewable energy credits (RECs), which are produced as a result of owning and operating commercial distributed energy systems. The value of these RECs is determined by markets in the states where the distributed energy systems are installed, which are driven by state laws relating to renewable portfolio standards or alternative compliance payment requirements for renewable energy. Overbuilding of distributed energy systems in these states or legislative changes reducing renewable portfolio standards or alternative compliance payment requirements could negatively impact the price of RECs that we sell and the value of the RECs that we hold in our portfolio.\nIn addition, WGL Energy Systems and WGSW\u2019s investment strategy of participating with counterparties in energy-related investments, or to directly own and operate energy assets and sell energy to customers, has historically allowed us to benefit from incentives in the federal tax code. WGL\u2019s ability to continue to benefit from these investments is based on certain assumptions about the level of our income taxes and our ability to utilize tax incentives to reduce our tax burden. Our ability to continue participating in these investments with counterparties depends in part on the effect of the Tax Act on the market demand for such investments.\nWGL may be impacted by changes in federal income tax policy.\nWGL is impacted by the United States federal income tax policy, including corporate income tax laws. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted comprehensive tax reform, including significant changes to the United States corporate income tax laws. Some provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act require interpretive guidance. As a result, management is currently unable to predict whether these reforms will have a cumulative positive or negative impact on corporations, including WGL. These changes in the United States federal income tax laws could have an adverse effect on cash flow, financial condition, and liquidity.\nWGL Energy Systems\u2019 inability to find counterparties for tax equity partnerships could negatively impact its results.\nWGL Energy Systems has derived a significant portion of its revenues from alternative energy investments, including investments in tax equity partnerships. The Tax Act reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. WGL anticipates that this reduction in the corporate tax rate may have a negative impact on its ability to continue to engage counterparties in these transactions as such counterparties\u2019 appetite for the tax benefits of such partnerships will decrease with the lower overall corporate tax rate. In addition, a base erosion anti-abuse tax, enacted as part of the Tax Act, may decrease the appetite for tax credits by counterparties who engage in business with foreign affiliates. Should WGL be unable to find sufficient or suitable counterparties for these partnerships going forward for any reason, including due to the enactment of the Tax Act, thus limiting its ability to enter into these transactions, WGL\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nLegislative and regulatory developments and other uncertainties, delays or cost overruns may negatively affect WGL Energy Services or our other non-utility subsidiaries.\nLegislation or changes in the regulations that govern the conduct of competitive energy marketers could reduce customer growth opportunities for WGL Energy Services and could reduce the profit opportunities associated with existing customers. In addition, our non-utility subsidiaries hold investments in natural gas related businesses that are subject to laws and regulations that could adversely affect their performance.\nCompetition may negatively affect our non-utility subsidiaries.\nWe face strong competition in our non-utility segments. WGL Energy Services competes with other non-regulated retail suppliers of natural gas and electricity, as well as with the commodity rate offerings of electric and gas utilities. Increases in competition, including utility commodity rate offers that are below prevailing market rates, may result in a loss of sales volumes or a reduction in growth opportunities. WGL Midstream competes with other midstream infrastructure and energy services companies, wholesale energy suppliers and other non-utility affiliates of regulated utilities to acquire natural gas storage and transportation assets. WGL Energy Systems faces many competitors in the commercial energy systems segment, including, for government customers, companies that contract with customers under ESPC and other utilities providing services under UESCs and, in the renewable energy and distributed generation market, other developers, tax equity investors, distributed generation asset owner firms and lending institutions. These competitors may have diversified energy platforms with multiple marketing approaches, broader geographic coverage, greater access to credit and other financial resources, or lower cost structures, and may make strategic acquisitions or establish alliances among themselves. There can be no assurances that we can compete successfully, and our failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow.\nWGL subsidiaries invest in non-controlling interests in investments and may have limited ability to manage risks associated with these investments.\nWe own, and may acquire additional, non-controlling interests in investments. We may not have the right or power to direct the management of these investments, and other investors may take action that is contrary to our interests. In addition, other participants may become bankrupt or have other economic or business objectives that could negatively impact the value and performance of our investments.\nReductions or delays in federal government budget appropriations may negatively impact WGL Energy Systems\u2019 earnings.\nThe Energy Efficiency and Energy Management operations of WGL Energy Systems are sensitive to federal government agencies\u2019 receipt of funding in a timely manner. A portion of WGL Energy Systems revenues is derived from implementing projects related to energy efficiency and energy conservation measures for federal government agencies in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area. A reduction or delay in funding for these federal agencies directly impacts completion of ongoing projects and may harm WGL Energy Systems\u2019 ability to obtain new contracts, which may negatively impact earnings.\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart I", "PERMNO": 21231, "SIC": 4924, "TIC": "WGL"}
