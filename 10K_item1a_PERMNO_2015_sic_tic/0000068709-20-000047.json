{"cik": "68709", "company": "MTS SYSTEMS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-12-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves risks. The following summarizes what we believe to be the most important risks facing us that could adversely impact our business, financial condition or operating results. The information about these risks should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nRisks Relating to our Business and Operations\nThe extent to which the outbreak of COVID-19 and measures taken to contain the outbreak will negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nOur global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and pandemics, such as the outbreak of COVID-19. Attempts to slow the spread of COVID-19 implemented by governments across the globe, including travel bans, restrictions on gatherings, shutdowns of business and government facilities, shelter in place orders, and quarantines, have impacted and will continue to impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and the operations of our vendors and suppliers.\nWe have significant manufacturing operations in North America, Europe and Asia, and each of the countries in which we operate has been affected by the outbreak and taken measures in an attempt to contain it. There is considerable uncertainty about the magnitude and duration of future containment measures and the impact on our operations and the operations of our suppliers and customers. The number of jurisdictions in which we operate add complexity to our efforts to operate under current and future restrictions. We also operate with a global supply chain, and both restrictions on the operations of our suppliers and regulation of the international movement of goods may prevent us from timely completing customer orders.\nIf the COVID-19 outbreak continues and conditions worsen, we may continue to experience a decline in sales activities and delays in customer orders. It remains uncertain what impact these declines will have on future sales and customer orders once conditions begin to improve. Many of our customer orders are part of large capital expenditures and the financial uncertainty resulting from COVID-19 and its market impacts may cause customers to delay planned capital expenditures.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, the severity of the outbreak, the actions of governments and private sectors to slow the spread of the outbreak, the effect of passed and potential future fiscal stimulus measures, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. We do not yet know the full extent of the impact on our business, our operations or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.\nOur business is significantly international in scope, which subjects us to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in foreign countries, and addressing these risks may be costly or may otherwise impact our financial position or results of operations.\nWe have manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe and Asia. Over the past 15 years, approximately 70% of our revenue has been derived from customers outside of the U.S. Although our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a large portion of our sales and operating costs are transacted in Euros, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen and other foreign currencies.\nAccordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in foreign countries. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022exposure to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations, where payment for products is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars;\n\u2022variability in the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated assets, earnings and cash flows;\n\u2022difficulty enforcing agreements, including patents and trademarks, and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;\n\u2022trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S., the imposition of withholding requirements on foreign earnings and restrictions on repatriation of foreign earnings;\n\u2022elevated risk of terrorist activity, war or civil unrest;\n\u2022the impact of global pandemics;\n\u2022imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions, including tariffs imposed by the U.S. and responsive tariffs imposed by China and the European Union;\n\u2022difficulty in staffing and managing global operations;\n\u2022required compliance with a variety of existing and emerging foreign laws and regulations and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, applicable to our international operations, and significant compliance costs and penalties for failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations; and\n\u2022changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, including emerging markets, continued volatility in currency exchange rates and uncertainties caused by the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union.\nThese risks could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, foreign currency fluctuations could also make our products more expensive than competitors' products not subject to these fluctuations, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability in international markets. As further described in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, revenue for fiscal year 2020 was unfavorably impacted by currency translation.\nOur business is subject to competition, which could cause us to have to adjust our product pricing or otherwise adjust our operations in order to remain competitive, and any of these changes could impact our operations and financial condition.\nOur products are sold in competitive markets throughout the world. Competition is based on application knowledge, product features and design, brand recognition, reliability, technology, breadth of product offerings, price, delivery, customer relationships and after-market support. If we are not perceived as competitive in overall value as measured by these criteria, our customers would likely choose solutions offered by our competitors or developed internally. In order to remain competitive, we may have to adjust our product pricing or otherwise make changes to our operations, which could potentially impact our financial condition.\nOur business is subject to customer demand cycles, and changes in those cycles may impact customer demand for our products, which could cause us to fail to meet our expectations as to revenue.\nFor many of our products, orders are subject to customers' procurement cycles and their willingness and ability to invest in capital, especially in the cyclical automotive, aircraft, entertainment and machine tool industries. Any event that adversely impacts those customers' new product development activities may reduce their demand for our products, which in turn will impact our revenue.\nWe may experience difficulty obtaining materials or components for our products, or the cost of materials or components may increase, which could adversely impact our production cycle and our margins.\nWe purchase materials and components from third-party suppliers, some of whom may be competitors. Other materials and components may be provided by a limited number of suppliers or by sole sources and could only be replaced with difficulty or at significant added cost. Additionally, some materials or components may become scarce or difficult to obtain in the market or they may increase in price. This could adversely affect the lead time within which we receive the materials or components, and in turn affect our commitments to our customers, or could adversely affect the cost or quality of materials. Our intention is to partner with suppliers who engage in supply chain transparency and responsible sourcing and who support human rights.\nIf we fail to achieve our long-term growth plans for the expansion of the business, our business and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition to market penetration, our long-term success depends on our ability to expand our business through (a) new product development and service offerings; (b) mergers and acquisitions; and/or (c) geographic expansion.\nNew product development and service offerings require that we maintain our ability to improve existing products, continue to bring innovative products and services to market in a timely fashion, and address changing global trends, to meet the needs and standards of current and potential customers. Our products and services may become less competitive or eclipsed by technologies to which we do not have access, or which render our solutions obsolete.\nMergers and acquisitions will be accompanied by risks that may include:\n\u2022failure to achieve, or delays in achieving, the financial and strategic goals, including growth opportunities and cost synergies, for the acquired and combined businesses;\n\u2022difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses, including the inability to eliminate duplicative costs or the substantial expenses that may be incurred in connection with integration;\n\u2022disruption of ongoing business and acquired business and distraction of management from the operation of both businesses;\n\u2022dilution of existing shareholders and earnings per share;\n\u2022unanticipated, undisclosed or inaccurately assessed liabilities, legal risks and costs;\n\u2022reputation risk associated with any pre-existing legal matters resulting from the acquired business;\n\u2022legal and regulatory requirements if the acquired business was not formerly a public company; and\n\u2022difficulties retaining the key vendors, customers or employees of the acquired business.\nAcquisitions of businesses having a significant presence outside the U.S. will increase our exposure to the risks of international operations discussed in the risks relating to our business and operations.\nGeographic expansion may be outside of the U.S., and hence will be disproportionately subject to the risks of international operations discussed in the risks relating to our business and operations.\nFor further information on our business acquisitions, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe initiated several restructuring actions during fiscal year 2020 and if these actions do not provide the results we expect or the cost of such actions is greater than our estimates, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, we initiated several restructuring actions through a series of global workforce reductions and facility closures, including the reorganization of our European operations within Test & Simulation intended to increase organizational effectiveness, gain operational efficiencies and provide cost savings that can be reinvested in our growth initiatives, a workforce reduction within Test & Simulation to reduce the overall cost structure in response to COVID-19, and a product rationalization of certain product lines in China designed to increase organizational effectiveness, gain operational efficiencies, improve profitability and provide permanent cost savings. We can make no assurances that our current estimates of costs and timing of these restructuring actions will be accurate or that additional costs will not be incurred as we continue the restructuring actions. Any differences from our current estimates could be material and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations through delays in our timeline or increased costs. Additionally, if these actions fail to provide the operational efficiencies and cost savings that we expect, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted.\nCertain Test & Simulation production operations in China are performed by our contract manufacturing partner and may be subject to delays, increased costs or other unanticipated consequences.\nWe partner with a contract manufacturer in China to provide organizational effectiveness and gain efficiencies in production processes for test systems manufactured in China. While we believe our China contract manufacturing partner to be qualified to manufacture our Test & Simulation segment products, we may need to address quality and delivery issues due to manufacturing performed outside of our control. Significant quality or delivery schedule concerns and unforeseen costs may adversely affect our relationships with customers and our overall business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe design and manufacture first-of-a-kind products, and our inability to accurately plan for these new products may result in higher-than-expected costs or damage to our reputation with our customers.\nWe design and build systems that are unique and innovative and, in some cases, the first created to address complex and unresolved issues. The design, manufacture and support of these systems may involve higher than planned costs. If we are unable to meet our customers' expectations, our reputation and ability to further utilize our expertise will likely be damaged.\nBacklog, sales, delivery and acceptance cycle for many of our products is irregular and may not develop as anticipated, which could require us to incur increased expenses or otherwise result in fluctuations in our periodic financial results.\nMany of our products have long sales, delivery and acceptance cycles. In addition, certain contracts within our backlog are subject to order cancellations. If an order is canceled, we typically would only be entitled to receive reimbursement from the customer for actual costs incurred under the arrangement plus a reasonable margin. Events may cause recognition of orders, backlog and results of operations to be irregular over shorter periods of time. These factors include the timing of individual large orders which may be impacted by interest rates, customer capital spending and product development cycles, design and manufacturing problems, capacity constraints, delays in product readiness, damage or delays in transit, problems in achieving technical performance requirements, and various customer-initiated delays. Any such delay or any cancellations may cause fluctuations in our reported periodic financial results and may cause our stated backlog conversion to revenue to be inaccurate.\nWe may be subject to product liability or other commercial litigation, which could be expensive, damage our reputation, or otherwise require significant management time and attention, each of which could adversely impact our business.\nOur products or services may be claimed to cause or contribute to personal injury or property damage to our customers' facilities, which could damage our reputation or necessitate a product recall. Additionally, we are, at times, involved in commercial disputes with third parties, such as customers, vendors and others. The ensuing claims may arise singularly, in groups of related claims or in class actions involving multiple claimants. Such claims, litigation and product recalls may be expensive and time consuming to resolve and may result in substantial liability to us, and any liability and related costs and expenses may not be recoverable through insurance or other forms of reimbursement.\nWe may experience difficulties obtaining and retaining the services of skilled employees, which could require us to incur additional costs to fill such positions or retain such employees, which may then require us to delay planned investments in our business.\nWe rely on knowledgeable, experienced and skilled technical personnel, particularly engineers, sales management and service personnel, to design, assemble, sell and service our products. We may be unable to attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of such people, which could require us to incur additional costs to fill such positions or retain such employees, which could then adversely affect our business by delaying our ability to make other investments or changes as planned. The inability to transfer knowledge and transition between roles within these teams could also adversely affect our business by delaying or impacting our ability to fulfill customers' orders.\nRisks Relating to our Indebtedness and Financial Position\nWe have recently recognized impairment charges for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets, and we may need to recognize further impairments in the future, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of October 3, 2020, the net carrying value of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible and long-lived assets (property and equipment, net and intangible assets, net) totaled $618,845. We periodically assess the value of these assets for impairment in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our businesses, significant unexpected or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other long-lived assets.\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for fiscal year 2020 we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill and long-lived assets of approximately $291,389, which reflects impairments to each of the Test & Simulation excluding E2M and R&D (Legacy Test), E2M and PCB reporting units. This impairment was generally driven by a decline in market conditions, including a sustained decrease in our stock price, and the current outlook for sales and projected profitability in the impacted reporting units. These impairment charges negatively impacted our results of operations for fiscal year 2020 and future impairment charges could have a further adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe level and terms of our indebtedness may limit our ability to operate our business as we desire and may require the use of our available cash resources to meet repayment obligations, which could reduce the cash available for other purposes and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have a senior secured credit facility that provides for a $200,000 revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) and a $460,000 tranche B term loan facility (the Term Facility), both of which require that we pay a variable interest rate on outstanding borrowings, as well as $350,000 in aggregate principal amount of 5.750% senior unsecured notes due 2027. The debt under the tranche B term loan facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1% of the original principal amount and matures on July 5, 2023.\nAs of October 3, 2020, we had $244,671 outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities, consisting of $169,095 on our tranche B term loan facility and $75,576 drawn under our revolving credit facility, and we had $350,000 in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. We may, at times, use debt under the revolving credit facility to continue to finance the growth of the business through acquisitions, finance working capital needs or purchase shares of our common stock.\nOur substantial debt could have important consequences to us, including:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow used in operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, which would reduce our liquidity and our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates, and corresponding increased interest expense, because future borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities would be at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes due to the costs and expenses associated with such debt;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022limiting our ability to adjust to changing marketplace conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt; and\n\u2022potentially causing us to fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments, which, among other things, require us to maintain specified financial ratios, which failure could, if not cured or waived, have a material adverse effect on our ability to fulfill our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities and the senior unsecured notes and on our business and prospects generally.\nIn addition, the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture that governs the senior unsecured notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including limitations on our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness (including guarantee obligations); incur liens; engage in mergers, consolidations and certain other fundamental changes; dispose of assets; make advances, investments and loans; engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; pay dividends, distributions and other payments in respect of capital stock; repurchase or retire capital stock, warrants or options; and engage in other actions that we may believe are advisable or necessary for our business. As a result of these restrictions, we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to capitalize on available business opportunities. Further, our tranche B term loan facility is also subject to mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances and requires a prepayment of a certain percentage of our excess cash flow. Any future mandatory prepayments will reduce our cash available for other purposes and could impact our ability to reinvest in other areas of our business. We do not anticipate an excess cash flow payment will be required in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nWe can provide no assurances that we will maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity. In the event of a default under any of our indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could elect to declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, which in turn could result in cross-defaults under our other indebtedness. The lenders under our senior secured credit facilities could also elect to terminate their commitments thereunder and cease making further loans, and such lenders could institute foreclosure proceedings against their collateral, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nFor further information on our financing arrangements, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nOur senior secured credit facilities bear, and other indebtedness we may incur in the future may bear, interest at a variable rate. As a result, at any given time interest rates on the senior secured credit facilities and any other variable rate debt could be higher or lower than current levels. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and therefore net income and associated cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease.\nIncreases in interest rates may directly impact the amount of interest we are required to pay and reduce earnings accordingly. In addition, developments in tax policy as a part of the Tax Act, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for a portion of the interest paid on outstanding indebtedness, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, the terms of our existing indebtedness allow us, under certain circumstances, to incur substantially more debt, incur substantial ordinary course operating obligations, and enter into other transactions, which would increase our leverage and further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nWe may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Although the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture that governs the senior unsecured notes contain restrictions on incurring additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. Additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as certain trade payables, that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments. To the extent we incur additional indebtedness or other obligations, the risks described above may increase.\nRisks Relating to Government Regulation, Intellectual Property, Information Security and Other Policies\nOur failure to comply with laws and regulations regarding government contracts could adversely impact our ability to continue to do business with the government, which could lead to a decline in revenue and future business opportunities.\nGovernment business is important to us and is expected to increase in the future. Revenue from U.S. government related contracts varies by year. Such revenue as a percent of our total revenue was 11%, 6% and 4% for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe must comply with procurement laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting and result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. Failure to comply could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to secure future U.S. government contracts and export control licenses, and our results of operations or financial condition. These laws and regulations also create compliance risks and affect how we do business with federal agency clients. U.S. government contracts, as well as contracts with certain foreign governments with which we do business, are also subject to modification or termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. Further, any investigation relating to, or suspension or debarment from, U.S. government contracting could have a material impact on our results of operations as, during the duration of any suspension or debarment, we would be prohibited or otherwise limited in our ability to enter into prime contracts or subcontracts with U.S. government agencies, certain entities that receive U.S. government funds or that are otherwise subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and certain state government or commercial customers who decline to contract with suspended or debarred entities. A federal suspension could also impact our ability to obtain export control licenses which are materially important to our business.\nCompliance with government regulations and policies imposes costs and other constraints, which may impact our financial condition or ability to do business in certain jurisdictions.\nOur manufacturing operations and past and present ownership and operation of real property subject us to extensive and changing federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations pertaining to regulatory compliance, such as environmental, health and safety, employee benefits, import and export compliance, intellectual property, product liability, tax matters and securities regulation. We expect to continue to incur costs to comply with these laws and may incur penalties for any failure to do so.\nIn particular, some of our export sales require approval from the U.S. government. Recent changes in policy may increase the number of our export sales that require licenses, in particular for certain sales to customers located in China, which would increase both our costs to make such sales and the time to do so. Depending on how these changes in policy are interpreted, this could limit our ability in certain cases to recognize these sales orders at all. Moreover, changes in political relations between the U.S. and foreign countries and/or specific potential customers for which export licenses may be required may cause a license application to be delayed or denied, or a previously issued license withdrawn, rendering us unable to complete a sale or vulnerable to competitors who do not operate under such restrictions.\nIn addition, the U.S. government has imposed tariffs on certain products imported from China as well as steel and aluminum imported from the European Union, Mexico and Canada. China and the European Union have imposed tariffs on U.S. products in response. These tariffs could force our customers or us to consider various strategic options including, but not limited to, looking for different suppliers, shifting production to facilities in different geographic regions, absorbing the additional costs or\npassing the cost on to customers. Moreover, any retaliatory actions by other countries where we operate could also negatively impact our financial performance.\nWe may fail to protect our intellectual property effectively or may infringe upon the intellectual property of others, which could result in increased costs to defend our intellectual property rights or could cause us to be unable to pursue new business opportunities.\nWe have developed significant proprietary technology and other rights that are used in our businesses. We rely on trade secret, copyright, trademark and patent laws and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. While we take enforcement of these rights seriously, other companies such as competitors or others in markets in which we do not participate may attempt to copy or use our intellectual property for their own benefit.\nThe intellectual property of others also has an impact on our ability to offer some of our products and services for specific uses or at competitive prices. Competitors' patents or other intellectual property may limit our ability to offer products and services to our customers. Any infringement on the intellectual property rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide, or could increase the cost of providing, our products and services.\nIntellectual property litigation can be very costly and could result in substantial expense and diversion of our resources, both of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there may be no effective legal recourse against infringement of our intellectual property by third parties, whether due to limitations on enforcement of rights in foreign jurisdictions or as a result of other factors.\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against misappropriation of data or breaches of security or we are unable to comply, or are perceived as being unable to comply, with evolving regulations and legal obligations related to data privacy, data protection and information security, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted due to costs we may have to incur to correct such issues or the reputational harm we may face.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication of cyber-attacks. Although we strive to have appropriate security controls in place, prevention of security breaches cannot be assured, particularly as cyber threats continue to evolve. As further discussed in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in November 2020, we were the victim of a ransomware incident that impacted operations. We have incurred expenses to-date to investigate and resolve the issues resulting from this incident, but as we continue our investigation into this incident, we may also be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our privacy and security measures or to resolve any vulnerabilities. The financial and reputational consequences of this incident and these risks could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, our handling of certain data is subject to a variety of existing and emerging laws and regulations, designed by various federal, state and foreign governments to regulate the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information. Several foreign countries in which we conduct business, including the European Economic Area (EEA), currently have in place, or have recently proposed, laws or regulations concerning privacy, data protection and information security, which are more restrictive than those imposed in the U.S. Some of these laws are in the early stages and we cannot yet determine the impact these laws and regulations, if implemented, may have on our business. However, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with these privacy laws, regulations, policies or obligations or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other customer data in our possession, could result in government enforcement actions, regulatory investigations, litigation, fines and penalties and/or adverse publicity, all of which could require us to change the way we collect and use personal and customer data and/or have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nWe are required to conduct a good faith reasonable country of origin analysis on our use of conflict minerals, which has imposed and may impose additional costs on us and could raise reputational and other risks.\nThe SEC has promulgated final rules in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. We have incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. We have adopted a policy relating to conflict minerals, incorporating the standards set forth in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance, which affects the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. As we continue our due diligence, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products through the procedures we have and may continue to implement. We may also encounter challenges in our efforts to satisfy customers that may require all of the components of products purchased to be certified as conflict-free. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier.\nIf we fail to maintain effective processes and controls relative to adherence to our Code of Conduct and related company policies, we may incur costs to remedy these violations and may suffer reputational harm, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur Code of Conduct and related company policies, which cover topics such as human and labor rights, anti-bribery, product quality and safety, privacy, security and environmental compliance, promote both a culture of ethical business practices and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. However, there can be no assurance that all of our employees or agents will refrain from acting in violation of such policies and procedures or that our processes and controls will be sufficient to detect any such violations. The investigation into potential violations of these policies, or even allegations of such violations, and the related evaluation of our internal controls, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction, and lead to significant costs and expenses, including legal and accounting fees, and such expenses may have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Further, if our employees or agents violate such policies and procedures, such actions could result in non-compliance with our internal control over financial reporting. If we, or our employees or agents acting on our behalf, are found to have engaged in practices that violate these policies and/or applicable law, we could suffer severe fines and penalties, repayment of ill-gotten gains, injunctions on future conduct, securities litigation, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, delayed regulatory filings and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, our reputation, sales activities or stock price could be adversely affected if we become the subject of any negative publicity related to actual or potential violations of applicable laws and regulations.\nChanging environmental regulations and industry standards, as well as the potential physical risks of climate change, create uncertainty and the costs of compliance with such regulations and standards could impact our results of operations and financial position.\nIncreased public awareness and concern regarding environmental risks, including global climate change, may result in more international, regional, and/or federal requirements or industry standards to reduce or mitigate global warming and other environmental risks. These regulations or standards could be more restrictive than those currently in place. Moreover, there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. In addition, the physical risks of climate change may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing. While no one product line puts us at substantial risk of climate change, our global operations require us to be cognizant of risks that span the globe and could impact our business as a whole. If the changing environmental laws or regulations or industry standards impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, or our operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change, our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted.", "PERMNO": 50623, "SIC": 3829, "TIC": "MTSC"}
