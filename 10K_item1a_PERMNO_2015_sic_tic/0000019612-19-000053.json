{"cik": "19612", "company": "CHEMICAL FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere are risks, many beyond our control, which could cause our results to differ significantly from management\u2019s expectations. Some of these significant risks and uncertainties are described below. Any factor described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could, by itself or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition, and the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to not be material also may materially and adversely affect us. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to other information disclosed in our SEC filings, including the financial statements and notes thereto. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ substantially from those discussed or implied in these forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to our Business\nIf we fail to effectively manage credit risk, our business and financial condition will suffer.\nWe must effectively manage credit risk. As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms, and that the collateral securing repayment of their loans, if any, may not be sufficient to ensure repayment. In addition, there are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks relating to proper loan underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, including the risk that a borrower may not provide information to us about its business in a timely manner, and/or may present inaccurate or incomplete information to us, and risks relating to the value of collateral. Collateral values are adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic, environmental and other conditions, including declines in the value of real estate, changes in interest rates, changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, terrorist activity, environmental contamination and other external events. In order to manage credit risk successfully, we must, among other things, maintain disciplined and prudent underwriting standards and ensure that our lenders follow those standards. The weakening of these standards for any reason, such as an attempt to attract higher yielding loans, a lack of discipline or diligence by our employees in underwriting and monitoring loans, the inability of our employees to adequately adapt policies and procedures to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting borrowers and the quality of our loan portfolio, may result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs and may necessitate that we significantly increase our allowance for loan losses, each of which could adversely affect our net income. As a result, our inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan losses, and fair value adjustments with respect to loans acquired in our acquisitions, may prove to be insufficient to absorb actual losses in our loan portfolio, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to net income that represents management's estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within our existing loan portfolio. The level of the allowance for loan losses reflects management's continuing evaluation of specific credit risks, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, the value of real estate, present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Deterioration in economic conditions and declines in real estate values affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses.\nThe application of the purchase method of accounting in our acquisitions (and any future acquisitions) will impact our allowance for loan losses. Under the purchase method of accounting, all acquired loans were recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements at their estimated fair value at the time of acquisition and any related allowance for loan loss was eliminated because credit quality, among other factors, was considered in the determination of fair value. To the extent that our estimates of fair value are too high, we will incur losses associated with the acquired loans. The allowance associated with our purchased credit impaired loans reflects deterioration in cash flows since acquisition resulting from our quarterly re-estimation of cash flows which involves complex cash flow projections and significant judgment on timing of loan resolution.\nIf our analysis or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our current allowance may not be sufficient, and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. Material additions to the allowance for loan losses would materially decrease our net income and adversely affect our general financial condition.\nIn addition, our regulators, as an integral part of their periodic examination, review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management.\nFinally, the measure of our allowance for loan losses is dependent on the adoption and interpretation of accounting standards. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") recently issued a new credit impairment model, the Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL model, which will become applicable to us in 2020. Under the CECL model, we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \"incurred loss\" model currently required under GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, we expect that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine our allowance for loan losses and could require us to significantly increase our allowance. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSee the sections captioned \"Allowance for Loan Losses\" in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5 - Loans in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, located elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion related to Chemical's process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses.\nWe may be adversely affected by risks associated with future mergers and acquisitions, including execution risk, which could disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value.\nWe plan to grow our business both organically and through mergers and acquisitions. We periodically evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies. As a result, we may engage in discussions or negotiations that, if they were to result in a transaction, could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition, including short- and long-term liquidity. Our merger and acquisition activities could be material and could require us to use a substantial amount of common stock, preferred stock, cash, other liquid assets, and/or incur debt. For example, in connection with our proposed merger of equals transaction with TCF announced on January 28, 2019, we will issue additional shares of our common stock to TCF stockholders, which will dilute our current shareholders' ownership interest in Chemical, and we will issue shares of a newly designated series of our preferred stock. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from our merger and acquisition activities, including our proposed merger with TCF, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including net income per common share.\nOur merger and acquisition activities, including our proposed merger with TCF, could involve a number of additional risks, including the risks of:\n\u2022\ndelay in completing an acquisition or merger due to litigation or the regulatory approval process;\n\u2022\nthe recording of assets and liabilities of the acquired or merged company at fair value may materially dilute shareholder value at the transaction date and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022\nincurring the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisition or merger targets;\n\u2022\ndifficulty or unanticipated expense associated with converting the operating systems of the acquired or merged company into ours:\n\u2022\npotential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired or merged company;\n\u2022\nour estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the acquired or merged company may not be accurate;\n\u2022\nour exposure to potential asset quality issues of the acquired or merged company;\n\u2022\nthe time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management and opening new offices, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management's attention to the negotiation of a transaction, and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products and services into our business;\n\u2022\npotential disruption to our business;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with an acquisition or merger and possible adverse short-term effects on our results of operations;\n\u2022\nthe possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired or merged company;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in estimating the value of the acquired or merged company; and\n\u2022\npotential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the acquired or merged company.\nFailure to successfully address these and other issues related to acquisitions and mergers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy.\nFuture mergers and acquisitions may be delayed, impeded, or prohibited due to regulatory issues.\nOur mergers and acquisitions, including our proposed merger with TCF, are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies. The process for obtaining these required regulatory approvals has become substantially more difficult in recent years. Regulatory approvals could be delayed, impeded, restrictively conditioned or denied due to existing or new regulatory issues we or the target company has, or may have, with regulatory agencies, including, without limitation, issues related to anti-money laundering/Bank Secrecy Act compliance, fair lending laws, fair housing laws, consumer protection laws, unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices regulations, Community Reinvestment Act issues, and other similar laws and regulations. We may fail to pursue, evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant acquisition opportunities as a result of our inability, or perceived or anticipated inability, to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, under reasonable conditions or at all. Difficulties associated with potential mergers and acquisitions that may result from these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks and uncertainties related to our proposed merger with TCF.\nBefore the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement can be completed, various approvals must be obtained, including approval of the FRB and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The terms and conditions of the approvals that are granted may impose conditions, limitations, obligations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company\u2019s business or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose any such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger or otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger if the merger were consummated successfully within the expected timeframe. In addition, there can be no assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger.\nChemical and TCF have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate independently. There can be no assurances that the businesses of Chemical and TCF can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key Chemical employees or key TCF employees, the loss of customers, the disruption of either company\u2019s or both companies\u2019 ongoing businesses, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. The success of the merger will depend on, among other things, the ability of Chemical and TCF to combine their businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes cost savings. However, if the combined company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nIn addition, the merger agreement contains provisions that restrict each of Chemical\u2019s and TCF\u2019s ability to, among other things, initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate, inquiries or proposals with respect to, or, subject to certain exceptions generally related to its board of directors\u2019 exercise of its fiduciary duties, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information relating to, any alternative acquisition proposals. These provisions, which include a $134.0 million termination fee payable under certain circumstances, might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Chemical from considering or proposing that acquisition, or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire Chemical than it might otherwise have proposed to pay.\nFailure to complete our proposed merger with TCF could negatively impact our business, financial results and stock price.\nIf our proposed merger with TCF is not completed for any reason, our ongoing business may be adversely affected, and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay TCF a termination fee of $134.0 million under the merger agreement;\n\u2022\nwe will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not the merger is completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees;\n\u2022\nthe merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of both Chemical\u2019s and TCF\u2019s business prior to completion of the merger, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies; and\n\u2022\nmatters relating to the merger may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us, as an independent company.\nIn addition, if the merger is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees. For example, we may be impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger. The market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed. We also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the merger agreement. If the merger is not completed, we cannot assure you that the risks described above will not materialize and will not materially affect our business, financial results and stock price.\nWe face risk of noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations and corresponding enforcement proceedings.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (which we refer to as the \"PATRIOT Act\") and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and to file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. FinCEN, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC. Federal and state bank regulators also have focused on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Sanctions that the regulators have imposed on banks that have not complied with all requirements have been especially severe. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nLitigation filed against Talmer, its board of directors and Chemical could result in the payment of damages.\nIn connection with the Talmer merger transaction, purported Talmer shareholders have filed putative class action lawsuits against Talmer, its board of directors and Chemical. These lawsuits could result in substantial costs to us, including any costs associated with indemnification. The defense or settlement of the lawsuits may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and market price.\nBecause our total assets exceed $10 billion, we are subject to additional regulation, increased supervision and increased costs.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act imposes additional regulatory requirements on financial institutions with $10 billion or more in total assets, such as us. We are subject to the following additional requirements:\n\u2022\nsupervision, examination and enforcement by the CFPB with respect to consumer financial protection laws;\n\u2022\na modified methodology for calculating FDIC insurance assessments and potentially higher assessment rates as a result of institutions with $10 billion or more in assets;\n\u2022\nheightened compliance standards under the Volcker Rule; and\n\u2022\nenhanced supervision as a larger financial institution.\nIn addition, under the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, institutions with $10 billion or more in assets are subject to a cap on the interchange fees that may be charged in certain electronic debit and prepaid card transactions. The maximum permissible interchange fee for electronic debit transactions is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and five basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. In addition, an issuer may charge up to one cent on each transaction as a fraud prevention adjustment if the issuer meets certain fraud prevention standards.\nThe imposition of these regulatory requirements and increased supervision may require additional commitment of financial resources to regulatory compliance and may increase our cost of operations.\nWe have a continuing need for technological change, and we may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology, or we may experience operational challenges when implementing new technology.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing technological change with introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to assist in meeting regulatory requirements. Our future success depends on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations and meet regulatory requirements as we continue to grow and expand our product and service offerings. Although we are committed to keeping pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology, our competitors may, through the use of new technologies that we have not implemented, whether due to cost or otherwise, be able to offer additional or superior products to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe also may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services, be successful in marketing such products and services to our customers or replace technologies that are obsolete or out of date with new technologies, which could result in a loss of customers seeking new technology-driven products and services to the extent we are unable to provide such products and services. In addition, the recent conversion of our core operating system and any future implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems represent significant operational and customer challenges upon implementation and for some time afterwards. Key challenges include service interruptions, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays, which may cause us to alienate customers or fail to comply with applicable laws, and may cause us to incur additional expenses, which may be substantial. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry and avoid interruptions, errors and delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe may face increased pressure from purchasers of our residential mortgage loans to repurchase those loans or reimburse purchasers for losses related to those loans.\nWe sell fixed rate long-term residential mortgage loans we originate in the secondary market. Purchasers of residential mortgage loans, such as government sponsored entities, require sellers of residential mortgage loans to either repurchase loans previously sold or reimburse purchasers for losses related to loans previously sold when losses are incurred on a loan previously sold due to actual or alleged failure to strictly conform to the purchaser's purchase criteria. As a result, we may face increased pressure from purchasers of our residential mortgage loans to repurchase those loans or reimburse purchasers for losses related to those loans and we may face increasing expenses to defend against such claims. If we are required in the future to repurchase loans previously sold, reimburse purchasers for losses related to loans previously sold, or if we incur increasing expenses to defend against such claims, our financial condition and results of operations would be negatively affected.\nWe hold general obligation municipal bonds in our investment securities portfolio. If one or more issuers of these bonds were to become insolvent and default on its obligations under the bonds, it could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe held general obligation municipal bonds totaling $888.9 million at December 31, 2018, which were issued by many different municipalities with no significant concentration in any single municipality. There can be no assurance that the financial conditions of these municipalities will not be materially and adversely affected by future economic conditions. If one or more of the issuers of these bonds were to become insolvent and default on their obligations under the bonds, it could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to liquidity risk in our operations, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our various obligations and jeopardize our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity risk is the possibility that we will not be able to meet our obligations as they come due or capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit obligations to borrowers, loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of debt, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and earnings retention, principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, net cash provided from operations and access to other funding. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain core deposits, to obtain third party financing on favorable terms, or to have access to interbank or other liquidity sources, we may not be able to grow our assets as quickly as we have historically. If customers move money out of bank deposits into other investments, we could lose a relatively low cost source of funds. This loss would require us to seek other funding alternatives, including wholesale funding, in order to continue to grow, thereby increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income. If we are unable to maintain adequate liquidity, then our business, financial condition and results of operations would be negatively affected.\nGeneral economic conditions, and in particular conditions in our core markets in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, affect our business.\nOur business is affected by general economic conditions in the United States, although most directly within our core markets in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. Our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the States of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana and the specific local markets in which we operate. The economic conditions in these local markets have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources. A significant majority of our loans are to individuals and businesses in Michigan. Consequently, any prolonged decline in Michigan's economy could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. While economic conditions have improved since the end of the economic recession, a return of recessionary conditions could impact the United States and our local markets which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not adjust to changes in the financial services industry, our financial performance may suffer.\nOur ability to maintain our financial performance and return on investment to shareholders will depend largely on our ability to continue to grow our loan portfolio and also, in part, on our ability to maintain and grow our core deposit customer base and expand our financial services to our existing and/or new customers. In addition to other banks, competitors include savings and loan associations, credit unions, securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors and finance and insurance companies. The increasingly competitive environment is, in part, a result of changes in the economic environment within the states in which we do business, regulation, and changes in technology and product delivery systems. New competitors may emerge to increase the degree of competition for our customers and services. Financial services and products are also constantly changing. Our financial performance will also depend, in part, upon customer demand for our products and services and our ability to develop and offer competitive financial products and service.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing customers to complete financial transactions without the involvement of banks. For example, consumers can now pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries in financial transactions, known as disintermediation, could result in the loss of fee income, the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits and lending opportunities.\nChanges in interest rates could reduce our net income and cash flow.\nOur net income and cash flow depends, to a great extent, on the difference between the interest we earn on loans and securities and the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings. Market interest rates are beyond our control, and they fluctuate in response to general economic conditions, the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and competition. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates and interest rate relationships, will influence the origination of loans, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits, the interest received on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Any significant adverse effects of changes in interest rates on the our results of operations, or any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See the sections captioned \"Net Interest Income\" in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations and \"Market Risk\" in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, located elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further discussion related to our management of interest rate risk.\nWe may be required to pay additional deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC, which could negatively impact earnings.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as Chemical Bank, up to $250,000 per account. The amount of a particular institution\u2019s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution\u2019s risk classification under an FDIC risk-based assessment system. Depending upon the magnitude of future losses that the FDIC deposit insurance fund suffers, there can be no assurance that there will not be additional premium increases or assessments in order to replenish the fund. The FDIC may need to set a higher base rate schedule based on future financial institution failures and updated failure and loss projections. Potentially higher FDIC assessment rates than those currently projected or special assessments could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur evaluation of investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment involves subjective determinations and could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur evaluation of impairments in our investment securities portfolio involves a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of such investments should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's net income, projected net income and financial condition or future recovery prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period. Estimating future cash flows involves incorporating information received from third-party sources and making internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral and/or value of the underlying asset and also assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred. The determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairments is based upon our quarterly evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\nAdditionally, our management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. Inherent in management's evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Considerations in the impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to: (i) the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost or amortized cost; (ii) the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties; (iii) the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub-sector; (iv) the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations; (v) the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer, series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources; (vi) our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value; (vii) unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; and (viii) other subjective factors, including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies. Impairments to the carrying value of our investment securities may need to be taken in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or core deposit intangible assets, or to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the amounts paid to acquire subsidiaries over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. We test goodwill at least annually for impairment. Substantially all of our goodwill at December 31, 2018 was recorded on the books of Chemical Bank. The fair value of Chemical Bank is impacted by the performance of its business and other factors. Core deposit intangible (\"CDI\") assets represent the estimated value of stable customer deposits, excluding time deposits, acquired in business combinations that provide a source of funds below market interest rates. We amortize our CDI assets over the estimated period the corresponding customer deposits are expected to exist. We test our CDI assets periodically for impairment. If we experience higher than expected deposit run-off, our CDI assets could be impaired. If we determined that our goodwill or CDI assets have been impaired, we must recognize a write-down by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income. Such write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2018, we had $1.13 billion of goodwill, representing 40.0% of shareholders' equity. We had $28.6 million of CDI assets at December 31, 2018.\nDeferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. Factors in management's\ndetermination include our performance, including the ability to generate taxable net income. If, based on available information, it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income. As of December 31, 2018, we carried a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of $1.5 million. Charges to establish a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax assets could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be a defendant in a variety of litigation and other actions, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are regularly involved in a variety of litigation arising out of the normal course of our business. Our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation or cause us to incur unexpected expenses, which could be material in amount. Should the ultimate expenses, judgments or settlements in any litigation exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may we be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe are subject to the Community Reinvestment Act and federal and state fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Federal Reserve, the CFPB, the Department of Justice, and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to our performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our rating under the Community Reinvestment Act and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe impacts of recent tax reform are not yet fully known, and these and other tax regulations could be subject to potential legislative, administrative or judicial changes or interpretations.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, has had, and is expected to continue to have, far-reaching and significant effects on us, our customers and the U.S. economy. The act lowered the corporate federal statutory tax rate and eliminated or limited certain federal corporate deductions. While it is too early to evaluate all of the potential consequences of the act, such consequences could include lower commercial customer borrowings, either due to the increase in cash flows as a result of the reduction in the corporate statutory tax rate or the utilization by businesses in certain sectors of alternative non-debt financing and/or early retirement of existing debt. Further, there can be no assurance that any benefits realized as a result of the reduction in the corporate federal statutory tax rate will ultimately result in increased net income, whether due to decreased loan yields as a result of competition or other factors. Uncertainty also exists related to state and other taxing jurisdictions' response to federal tax reform, which we will continue to monitor and evaluate. Federal income tax treatment of corporations may be further clarified and modified by other legislative, administrative or judicial changes or interpretations at any time. Any such changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to real properties that we may acquire.\nIn the course of our business, we may acquire, through foreclosure, properties securing loans we have originated or purchased that are in default. Particularly in commercial real estate lending, there is a risk that hazardous substances could be discovered on these properties. In this event, we might be required to remove these substances from the affected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of this removal could substantially exceed the value of the affected properties. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties seeking damages for environmental contamination emanating from the site. We may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. If we were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities or costs, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about our customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, and in evaluating and monitoring our loan portfolio on an ongoing basis, we rely on information provided to us by or on behalf of our customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of those customers and counterparties or of other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate, incomplete, fraudulent or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial or business information, or the failure to receive such information on a timely basis, could result in loan losses, reputational damage or other effects that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and market area.\nWe face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources than us. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, other financial service businesses, including investment advisory and wealth management firms, mutual fund companies, and securities brokerage and investment banking firms, as well as super-regional, national and international financial institutions that operate offices in our primary market areas and elsewhere. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. As customers' preferences and expectations continue to evolve, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet and for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Because of this rapidly changing technology, our future success will depend in part on our ability to address our customers\u2019 needs by using technology.\nWe compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and assets under management, and in making new loans. We may not be able to compete successfully with other financial institutions in our markets, particularly with larger financial institutions operating in our markets that have significantly greater resources than us and offer financial products and services that we are unable to offer, putting us at a disadvantage in competing with them for loans and deposits and investment management clients, and we may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits, accept lower yields on loans to attract loans and pay higher wages for new employees, resulting in lower net interest margin and reduced profitability. In addition, many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures, such as credit unions that are not subject to federal income tax.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, maintain and build long-term customer relationships based on quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand our market position;\n\u2022\nour ability to keep up-to-date with technological advancements in both delivering new products and maintaining existing products, while continuing to invest in cybersecurity and control operating costs;\n\u2022\nthe scope, relevance and pricing of products and services we offer to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022\nthe rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\ncustomer satisfaction with our level of service; and\n\u2022\nindustry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our executive officers and other key employees to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy, and we could be harmed by the unexpected loss of their services.\nWe believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our executive officers and other key employees and our ability to motivate and retain these individuals, as well as our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management and other skilled employees. Competition for employees is intense, and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute our business strategy may be lengthy. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of our proposed merger with TCF, as employees of Chemical and TCF may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If we are unable to retain personnel, including our key management, who are critical to the successful integration and our future operations, we could face disruptions in our operations, loss of existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how, and unanticipated additional recruitment costs. If the services of any of our of key personnel should become unavailable for any reason, we may not\nbe able to identify and hire qualified persons on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and future prospects. In addition, the loss of key personnel could diminish the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger with TCF.\nThe banking industry is heavily regulated and that regulation, together with any future legislation or regulatory changes, could limit or restrict our activities and adversely affect our operations or financial results.\nWe operate in an extensively regulated industry and we are subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies. Our compliance with banking regulations is costly and restricts some of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates and locations of offices. We are also subject to capitalization guidelines established by our regulators, which require us to maintain adequate capital to support our business.\nSince the recession ended, federal and state banking laws and regulations, as well as interpretations and implementations of these laws and regulations, have undergone substantial review and change. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act drastically revised the laws and regulations under which we operate. The burden of regulatory compliance has increased under the Dodd-Frank Act and has increased our costs of doing business and, as a result, may create an advantage for our competitors who may not be subject to similar legislative and regulatory requirements. Any future changes in federal and state laws and regulations, as well as the interpretation and implementation of such laws and regulations, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including those listed above or other ways that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFurthermore, our regulators also have the ability to compel us to take certain actions, or restrict us from taking certain actions entirely, such as actions that our regulators deem to constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, or regulatory policies and interpretations of such laws and regulations, could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties or damage to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business needs and future growth may require us to raise additional capital, but that capital may not be available or may be dilutive.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain specified levels of capital to support our operations. We may need to raise additional capital, in the form of debt or equity, in the future to have sufficient capital resources to meet our commitments and to fund our business needs and future growth, particularly if the quality of our assets or earnings were to deteriorate significantly. In addition, we are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and on our financial performance. We cannot assure that we will be able to raise additional capital in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. Any occurrence that limits our access to capital, may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. Any inability to raise capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could be dilutive to both tangible book value and our share price.\nIn addition, an inability to raise capital when needed may subject us to increased regulatory supervision and the imposition of restrictions on our growth and business. These restrictions could negatively affect our ability to operate or further expand our operations through loan growth, acquisitions or the establishment of additional branches. These restrictions may also result in increases in operating expenses and reductions in revenues that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our share price.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral that we hold cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan. We can give no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. A significant failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers or other third parties, including as a result of cyberattacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other sensitive business and consumer information on our computer systems and networks and third party providers. Under various federal and state laws, we are responsible for safeguarding such information. For example, our business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (1) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share nonpublic personal information about our customers with nonaffiliated third parties; (2) requires that we provide certain disclosures to customers about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford customers the right to \"opt out\" of any information sharing by us with nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and (3) requires that we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of customer information we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Ensuring that our collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase our costs.\nAlthough we take protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information across all geographic and product lines, and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of the threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber-attacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact. Despite the defensive measures we take to manage our internal technological and operational infrastructure, these threats may originate externally from third parties such as foreign governments, organized crime and other hackers, and outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or may originate internally from within our organization. Furthermore, we may not be able to ensure that all of our clients, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with us, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. Given the increasingly high volume of our transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they can be discovered and rectified. In addition, the increasing reliance on technology systems and networks and the occurrence and potential adverse impact of attacks on such systems and networks, both generally and in the financial services industry, have enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyber-security threats. As these threats, and government and regulatory oversight of associated risks, continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to enhance or expand upon the security measures we currently maintain.\nIn particular, information pertaining to us and our customers is maintained, and transactions are executed, on the networks and systems of us, our customers and certain of our third-party partners, such as our online banking or reporting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our customers against fraud and security breaches and to maintain our clients\u2019 confidence. While we have not experienced any material breaches of information security, such breaches may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access or gaining access to our systems or our customers\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential information, including employees. In addition, increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third-party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our customers and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our customers to access our systems. We cannot be certain that the security measures or third party processors we have in place to protect this sensitive data will be successful or sufficient to protect against all current and emerging threats designed to breach our systems or those of processors. Although we have developed, and continue to invest in, systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and periodically test our security, a breach of our systems, or those of processors, could result in losses to us or our customers; loss of business and/or customers; damage to our reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses (including the cost of notification to consumers, credit monitoring and forensics, and fees and fines imposed by the card networks); disruption to our business; our inability to grow our online services or other businesses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties; or our exposure\nto civil litigation and possible financial liability-any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on information technology and telecommunications systems of third-party servicers, and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security involving these systems could have an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems, third-party servicers accounting systems and mobile and online banking platforms. We outsource some of our major systems, such as payment processing systems, and online banking platforms. To revise based on outsourced systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal loans, gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, failure of third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or fraud or misconduct on the part of employees of any of these third parties could disrupt our operations or adversely affect our reputation.\nIt may be difficult for us to replace some of our third party vendors, particularly vendors providing our core banking, debit card services and information services, in a timely manner if they are unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future for any reason and even if we are able to replace them, it may be at higher cost or result in the loss of customers. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of information and the monitoring of a large number of transactions on a minute-by-minute basis, and even a short interruption in service could have significant consequences. We also interact with and rely financial counterparties and regulators. Each of these third parties may be targets of the same types of fraudulent activity, computer break-ins and other cyber security breaches described above or herein, and the cyber security measures that they maintain to mitigate the risk of such activity may be different than our own and may be inadequate.\nAs a result of financial entities and technology systems becoming more interdependent and complex, a cyber incident, information breach or loss, or technology failure that compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including ourselves. Although we review business continuity and backup plans for our vendors and take other safeguards to support our operations, such plans or safeguards may be inadequate. As a result of the foregoing, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact.\nAdditionally, regulators expect financial institutions to be responsible for all aspects of their performance, including aspects which they delegate to third parties. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and clients, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems, devices, or software that our clients use to access our products and services could result in client attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe rely on quantitative models to manage certain accounting, risk management and capital planning functions.\nWe use quantitative models to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions, including estimating probable loan losses, measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable, estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, risk management and for capital planning purposes. Our modeling methodologies rely on many assumptions, historical analyses and correlations. These assumptions may be incorrect, particularly in times of market distress, and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant. Additionally, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution. Even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate, our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, bad data, misuse of data, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model\u2019s design.\nAll models have certain limitations. Reliance on models presents the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporated from models will be adversely affected due to incorrect, missing or misleading information. In addition, our models\nmay not capture or fully express the risks we face, may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not, or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate. If our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, we may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or other business or financial decisions. Strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable, and as a result, we may realize losses or other lapses. Also, information that we provide to the public or regulators based on poorly designed models could be inaccurate or misleading.\nBanking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses. Some of our decisions that the regulators evaluate, including distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient. Accordingly, the failure or inadequacy of a model may result in increased regulatory scrutiny on us or may result in an enforcement action or proceeding against us by one of our regulators.\nOur ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business, including our ability to attract and retain customer relationships, and failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nThe reputation of Chemical Bank is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. Damage to our reputation could undermine the confidence of our current and potential clients in our ability to provide financial services. Such damage could also impair the confidence of our investors, counterparties and business partners, and ultimately affect our ability to effect transactions or maintain or hire qualified management and personnel. Maintenance of our reputation depends not only on our success in controlling and mitigating the various risks described herein, but also on our success in identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in areas such as potential conflicts of interest, anti-money laundering, client personal information and privacy issues, record-keeping, regulatory investigations and any litigation that may arise from the failure or perceived failure of us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of our employees or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected. Further, negative public opinion can expose us to litigation and regulatory action, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nInvestments in our common stock involve risk.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nVariations in quarterly or annual results of operations\n\u2022\nChanges in dividends paid per share\n\u2022\nDeterioration in asset quality, including declining real estate values\n\u2022\nChanges in interest rates\n\u2022\nChanges in tax laws\n\u2022\nSignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by, or involving, Chemical or its competitors\n\u2022\nFailure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions\n\u2022\nRegulatory actions, including changes to regulatory capital levels, the components of regulatory capital and how regulatory capital is calculated\n\u2022\nNew regulations that limit or significantly change Chemical's ability to continue to offer existing banking products\n\u2022\nVolatility of stock market prices and volumes\n\u2022\nIssuance of additional shares of common stock or other debt or equity securities of Chemical\n\u2022\nChanges in market valuations of similar companies\n\u2022\nUncertainties, disruptions and fluctuations in the credit and financial markets, either nationally or globally\n\u2022\nChanges in securities analysts' estimates of financial performance or recommendations\n\u2022\nNew litigation or contingencies or changes in existing litigation or contingencies\n\u2022\nNew technology used, or services offered, by competitors\n\u2022\nBreaches in information security systems of Chemical and/or its customers and competitors\n\u2022\nChanges in accounting policies or procedures required by standard setting or other regulatory agencies\n\u2022\nNew developments in the financial services industry\n\u2022\nNews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry\n\u2022\nPerceptions in the marketplace regarding the financial services industry, the Corporation and/or its competitors\n\u2022\nRumors or erroneous information\n\u2022\nGeopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts\nWe may issue debt and equity securities that are senior to our common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nOur authorized capital stock includes 135 million shares of common stock and two million shares of preferred stock, which can be issued without further shareholder approval. As of December 31, 2018, we had 71,460,119 shares of common stock outstanding and had 1,301,285 shares reserved for issuance underlying options and restricted stock awards under our existing equity plans. As of December 31, 2018, we had no shares of preferred stock outstanding. In connection with our planned merger with TCF, which was announced on January 28, 2019, based on the number of shares of Chemical common stock and TCF common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018, and based on the number of shares of Chemical common stock expected to be issued in the merger, the former stockholders of TCF, as a group, will receive shares in the merger constituting approximately 54% of the outstanding shares of Chemical common stock immediately after the merger. As a result, current shareholders of Chemical, as a group, will own approximately 46% of the outstanding shares of Chemical common stock immediately after the merger. In connection with the merger, we will also issue shares of our preferred stock, to be designated Series C 5.70% Series C Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, with equivalent rights, preferences, privileges, as those of the TCF Series C 5.70% Series C Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, for which they are exchanged. The merger, which is expected to close the late third or early fourth quarter of 2019, is subject to, among other things, required regulatory approvals and the affirmative vote of both our shareholders and TCF\u2019s stockholders to approve or adopt the merger agreement, as applicable, and in the case of Chemical, to approve an amendment to our articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Chemical common stock and to change our name to TCF Financial Corporation, effective only upon completion of the merger. In addition, in the future, we may increase our capital resources by entering into debt or debt-like financing or issuing debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of senior notes, subordinated notes, preferred stock or common stock.\nIn the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt securities and preferred stock would receive a distribution of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock. Our decision to incur debt and issue securities in future offerings may depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control. We cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financings, if any. Future offerings could reduce the value of shares of our common stock and dilute a shareholder's interest in Chemical.\nChemical relies on dividends from Chemical Bank for most of its revenue.\nChemical is a separate and distinct legal entity from Chemical Bank. It receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from Chemical Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay cash dividends on Chemical's common stock. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that Chemical Bank may pay to Chemical. In the event Chemical Bank is unable to pay dividends to Chemical, Chemical may not be able to pay cash dividends on its common stock. The earnings of Chemical Bank have been the principal source of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders. Over the long-term, cash dividends to shareholders are dependent upon earnings, as well as capital requirements, regulatory restraints and other factors affecting Chemical Bank. See the section captioned \"Supervision and Regulation\" in Item 1. Business and Note 21 - Regulatory Capital and Reserve Requirements in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which are located elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nShares of our common stock are not insured deposits.\nShares of our common stock are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other governmental agency, and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.", "PERMNO": 11992, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "TCF"}
