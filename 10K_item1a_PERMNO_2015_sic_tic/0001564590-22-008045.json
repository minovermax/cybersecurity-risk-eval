{"cik": "1756262", "company": "TransMedics Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our common stock involves risks. You should consider carefully the following risks and all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before investing in our common stock. The risks described below are those that we believe are the material risks that we face. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could suffer materially, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred substantial losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate net revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on successful commercialization of our OCS products. We generated net revenue of $30.3 million and $25.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and incurred net losses of $44.2 million and $28.7 million for these same years. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $442.4 million. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from sales of equity, borrowings under loan agreements and revenue from clinical trials and commercial sales of our OCS products. Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with our research and development, clinical trials, manufacturing and commercialization activities, including the development of our National OCS Program.\nWe expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we focus on growing commercial sales of our products in both the U.S. and select non-U.S. markets, including growing our commercial team, which will pursue increasing commercial sales of our OCS products; scaling our manufacturing operations; continuing research and development for our next generation OCS products; and seeking regulatory clearance for new products and product enhancements, including new indications, in both the U.S. and select non-U.S. markets. The timing and amount of our operating and capital expenditures will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe amount of net revenue generated by sales of our OCS Consoles, OCS Perfusion Sets and OCS Solutions and other products that may be approved in the United States and select non-U.S. markets;\n\u2022\nthe costs and expenses of expanding our U.S. and non-U.S. commercial infrastructure and our manufacturing operations;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our OCS products are adopted by the transplant community;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our customers to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed using the OCS products;\n\u2022\nthe costs incurred in our efforts to develop our National OCS Program;\n\u2022\nthe degree of success we experience in commercializing our OCS products for additional indications;\n\u2022\nthe costs, timing and outcomes of any future clinical studies and regulatory reviews, including to seek and obtain approvals for new indications for our OCS products;\n\u2022\nthe emergence of competing or complementary technologies;\n\u2022\nthe number and types of future products we develop and commercialize;\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims; and\n\u2022\nthe level of our selling, general and administrative expenses.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe may need to raise additional funding, which might not be available on favorable terms or at all. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our shareholders.\nAlthough we fund a portion of our operations from net revenue from sales of our OCS products, we expect that we will need to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and strategic alliances until such time, if ever, that we can generate substantial net revenue sufficient to achieve profitability. We also may elect to raise additional funds sooner because we believe market conditions are attractive or as a risk mitigation measure. Additional capital might not be available when we need it, and our actual cash requirements might be greater than anticipated. If we require additional capital at a time when investment in our industry or in the marketplace in general is limited, we might not be able to raise funding on favorable terms, if at all. If we are not able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us, we may need to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue our development or commercialization activities, sell or license to third parties some or all of our assets or merge with another entity or may be forced to reduce or terminate our operations any of which could result in a loss of all or part of your investment.\nIf we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, the issuance of these securities could dilute your percentage ownership in our company. Furthermore, newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of common shareholders. If we raise additional funds through additional debt financing, we may need to dedicate a substantial additional portion of any operating cash flows to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness. The terms of any debt financing also could impose significant restrictions on our operations.\nOur existing and any future indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our outstanding principal balance of long-term debt under our credit agreement with OrbiMed Royalty Opportunities II, LP, or OrbiMed, was $35.0 million, which we refer to as the Credit Agreement. We could incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our payment obligations under the Credit Agreement reduce cash available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development and general corporate needs. In addition, indebtedness under the Credit Agreement bears interest at a variable rate, making us vulnerable to increases in market interest rates. If market rates increase substantially, we will have to pay additional interest on this indebtedness, which would further reduce cash available for our other business needs. We may not have sufficient funds, and may be unable to arrange for additional financing, to pay the amounts due under or refinance our indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, which matures in June 2023.\nOur obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. The security interest granted over our assets could limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains negative covenants restricting our activities, including limitations on dispositions, mergers or acquisitions; encumbering our intellectual property; incurring indebtedness or liens; paying dividends or redeeming stock or making other distributions; making certain investments; liquidating our company; modifying our organizational documents; entering into sale-leaseback arrangements and engaging in certain other business transactions. In addition, we are required to maintain a minimum liquidity amount of $3.0 million. Failure to comply with the covenants in the Credit Agreement, including the minimum liquidity, could result in the acceleration of our obligations under the Credit Agreement, which are also subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of specified events of default, including payment default, change in control, bankruptcy, insolvency, certain defaults under other material debt, certain events with respect to regulatory approvals and a material adverse change in our business, operations or other financial condition. If an event of default (other than certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency) occurs and is continuing, OrbiMed may declare all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the borrowings plus accrued and unpaid interest to be due and payable. Upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all of the outstanding principal amount of the borrowings plus accrued and unpaid interest will automatically become due and payable. If such acceleration were to occur, it would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\nOur outstanding indebtedness and any future indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations, could increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and market conditions, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry and impose a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or better debt servicing options. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis-Long-term Debt\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes our results difficult to predict and may cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nOur financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including the availability of donor organs for transplantation, which is unpredictable and could impact the volume of transplant procedures performed at transplant centers using the OCS, and foreign currency exchange rates. Our revenue from sales may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and our future quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenue may be significantly different from those we have recorded in the past. Our financial results in some quarters may fall below expectations. Comparing our financial results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Because the timing of organ transplant procedures is generally unpredictable, we have not experienced seasonality in our business from quarter to quarter.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of $368.1 million and $304.0, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income. Our U.S. federal NOL carryforwards began to expire in 2022 and our state NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2030. The Company\u2019s federal net operating losses include $156.4 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2021, we also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $8.0 million and $5.3 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future tax liabilities. Our U.S. federal research and development tax credit carry forwards began to expire in 2021 and our state research and development tax credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2024. A material portion of these NOL and tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. In addition, in general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change by value in its equity ownership over a three-year period, is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs, its research and development credit carryforwards and its disallowed interest expense carryovers to offset future taxable income. Our existing NOLs and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, some of which might be beyond our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs and credits may also be impaired under state law. For these reasons, if we determine that an ownership change has occurred or in the event we experience a change of control, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs, research and development credit carryforwards or disallowed interest expense carryovers incurred prior to 2018.\nFurthermore, our ability to utilize our NOLs or credits is conditioned upon our attaining profitability and generating U.S. federal and state taxable income. As described above, we have incurred significant net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future; and therefore, we do not know whether or when we will generate the U.S. federal or state taxable income necessary to utilize our NOL or credit carryforwards. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, NOLs arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 will not be subject to expiration. In addition, the deduction for NOLs in any taxable year is limited to 80% of annual taxable income in respect of NOLs generated during or after 2018. The TCJA also reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21%, from a prior rate of 35%. This may cause a reduction in the potential economic benefit of our NOLs and other available deferred tax assets.\nThe transition away from LIBOR may adversely affect our cost to obtain financing.\nOn July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, rates after 2021. The Financial Conduct Authority and the ICE Benchmark Administration recently announced that LIBOR may continue for legacy contracts until June 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of U.S. financial market participants, selected and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has recommended the Secured Overnight Finance Rate, or SOFR, as an alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash in the overnight U.S. treasury repo market. Rates linked to SOFR or associated changes related to the adoption of SOFR may not be as favorable to us as LIBOR and may result in an effective increase in the applicable interest rate on our current or future debt obligations, including our Credit Agreement.\nRisks Related to Product Development and Commercialization\nWe depend heavily on the success of the OCS and achieving market acceptance. If we are unable to successfully commercialize the OCS, our business may fail.\nWe have invested all of our efforts and financial resources in the development of the OCS, educating surgeons, transplant centers, Organ Procurement Organizations and private and public payors of the benefits of the OCS and providing services related to the OCS. Although we have received PMAs from the FDA for preservation of donor lungs for the transplantation of DBD and DCD donor organs, for the preservation of donor hearts for the transplantation of DBD donor organs and for the preservation of donor livers from DBD and certain DCD donor organs, we might not successfully commercialize the OCS for these approved indications or obtain approvals for additional indications or in additional jurisdictions on our planned timing or at all. Our ability to generate product revenue and become profitable depends primarily on sales of OCS Perfusion Sets and OCS Solutions, which we refer to collectively as disposable sets, and OCS Consoles. Our assumptions regarding demographic trends, donor organ availability and the use of transplantation as a treatment for end-stage organ failure may prove to be incorrect.\nIn order to achieve market acceptance for the OCS, we expect that we will need to demonstrate to surgeons, transplant center program directors, Organ Procurement Organizations and private and public payors that the OCS potentially results in some or all of the following: improvements in post-transplant clinical outcomes, increases in the utilization of donor organs, expansion of the pool of potential donors and reduction in the total cost of care as compared to available alternatives. In addition, the medical community might not consider data collected from our patient registry meaningful or compelling, or the data collected from our patient registry or any clinical or commercial experience could indicate that the OCS is unsafe, which would substantially undermine our commercialization efforts.\nSurgeons, transplant centers and private and public payors often are slow to adopt new products, technologies and treatment practices that require additional upfront costs and training. The cost of the OCS significantly exceeds the cost of cold storage preservation. In addition, surgeons may not be willing to undergo training to use the OCS, may decide the OCS is too complex to adopt without appropriate training and may choose not to use the OCS. Based on these and other factors, transplant center program directors, Organ Procurement Organizations and private and public payors may decide that the benefits of the OCS do not outweigh its costs. In addition, adoption of the OCS may be constrained by the capacity of individual transplant centers to perform transplants due to factors such as the number of its surgeons trained on the use of the OCS. As a result, demand for the OCS could be materially lower than we expect it to be, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\nWe must continue to educate surgeons, transplant centers and private and public payors and demonstrate the merits of the OCS compared with cold storage or new competing technologies.\nDirectors of transplant programs are key decision-makers in the adoption of novel medical devices used in organ transplantation. An important part of our commercialization efforts is to educate transplant center program directors and other surgeons on the relative merits of the OCS. Our success depends, in large part, on effectively marketing and educating program directors and other surgeons about the benefits of the OCS. Acceptance of the OCS also depends on educating program directors, other surgeons and private and public payors as to the distinctive characteristics, perceived medical and economic benefits, safety, ease of use and cost-effectiveness of the OCS. If program directors, other surgeons and private and public payors do not find our body of published clinical evidence and data compelling or wish to wait for additional studies, they may choose not to use or provide coverage and reimbursement for our products. Currently, most universal national healthcare systems outside of the United States do not reimburse transplant centers for the use of the OCS and reimbursement in international markets may require us to undertake additional clinical studies.\nIn addition, the long-term effects of our OCS following transplantation are not yet known. Certain surgeons, transplant centers and private and public payors may prefer to see longer-term safety and efficacy data than we have produced. We cannot provide assurance that any data that we or others may generate in the future will be consistent with that observed in our existing clinical studies.\nOur long-term growth depends on our ability to expand access to the OCS through our National OCS Program.\nWe are developing a National OCS Program, a turnkey solution to provide outsourced organ retrieval and OCS organ management, to provide transplant programs with a more efficient process to procure donor organs with the OCS. We believe the National OCS Program will expand access and use of the OCS. However, we may not be successful in the continued\ndevelopment of our National OCS Program, which will depend on recruiting and retaining qualified surgeons and coordinating with transplant centers and regional Organ Procurement Organizations. We may not be able to recruit and retain surgeons and other qualified personnel, including due to demand for their capabilities and competitive compensation offered by other employers. In order to recruit and retain such highly qualified employees, we also may need to increase the level, or change the form or composition, of the compensation that we pay to them, which would increase our expenses.\nIn addition to our own surgical and clinical personnel, we utilize a network with a limited number of partners for a portion of our organ retrieval, organ preservation and transportation services offered through our National OCS Program. If our partners are unable to fulfill their obligations under their contracts, it could harm our operations. If any of these relationships are interrupted or terminated, or if one or more partners are unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations for whatever reasons, National OCS program services to our customers may be interrupted, and business and financial results may be negatively impacted. Further, we may not be able to identify or negotiate with additional partners on terms that are commercially reasonable to us. In addition, as the National OCS Program expands access to the OCS, transplant surgeons may increasingly rely on information provided to them by our clinical specialists and surgeons. We are responsible for the accuracy of information about the OCS that is provided to transplant surgeons who participate in the National OCS Program.\nOur long-term growth depends on our ability to improve the OCS platform, including by expanding into new indications and developing the next generation of our products.\nOur business plan contemplates that we will continue to improve the OCS platform, including by expanding into additional organs and developing the next generation of our products. Developing such new or modified products is expensive and time-consuming and diverts management\u2019s attention away from current operations. The success of any new product offering or product enhancements to our OCS platform will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nproperly identify and anticipate surgeon and patient needs;\n\u2022\ndevelop and introduce new products and product modifications in a timely manner;\n\u2022\navoid infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of third parties;\n\u2022\ndemonstrate the safety and efficacy of new products and product modifications;\n\u2022\nobtain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals;\n\u2022\ncomply with regulations regarding the marketing of new products or product modifications;\n\u2022\nprovide adequate training to potential users of our products;\n\u2022\nreceive adequate coverage and reimbursement for procedures performed with our products; and\n\u2022\ndevelop an effective commercialization effort.\nIf we are not successful in expanding our indications and developing the next generation of our products, our ability to increase our revenue may be impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\nWe have limited experience in directly marketing and selling our products, and if we are unable to successfully expand our sales infrastructure and adequately address our customers\u2019 needs, it could negatively impact sales and market acceptance of our products and we may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have limited experience in directly marketing and selling our products in the United States. Our operating results are dependent upon our sales and marketing efforts. If we fail to adequately promote and market our products, our sales may not grow or could significantly decrease.\nWe believe it is necessary to utilize a sales force that incorporates a specialized group consisting of sales representatives and clinical specialists who have experience with products to support our customers\u2019 needs. Competition for sales representatives and marketing employees is intense and we may be unable to attract and retain sufficient personnel to\nmaintain an effective sales and marketing force. If we are unable to adequately address our customers\u2019 needs, it could negatively impact sales and market acceptance of our products, and we may not generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur future success will depend largely on our ability to continue to hire, train, retain and motivate skilled surgeons, sales representatives and clinical specialists, and ensuring our sales program offerings satisfy the needs of our customers. New hires require training and take time to achieve full productivity. If we fail to train new hires adequately, if we experience high turnover in our sales force in the future, or if our sales program offerings do not satisfy the needs of our customers, new hires may not become as productive as may be necessary to maintain or increase our sales.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our net revenue and the loss of, or a significant shortfall in demand from, these customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe generate a significant amount of our net revenue from a limited number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Duke University accounted for 11% of our net revenue. We expect that sales to relatively few customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net revenue in future periods. However, these customers or any of our other customers may not continue to utilize our products at current levels, pricing, or at all, and our revenue could fluctuate significantly due to changes in economic conditions, the use of other methods for organ preservation, such as cold storage, or the loss of, reduction of business with, or less favorable terms with any of our largest customers. Our future success will depend upon the timing and volume of business from our largest customers and the financial and operational success of these customers. If we were to lose one of our key customers or have a key customer significantly reduce its volume of business with us, our revenue may be materially reduced, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\nWe depend on single-source suppliers and, in a few cases, sole-source suppliers for many of the components used in the OCS.\nWe rely on single-source suppliers and, in a few cases, sole-source suppliers for many of the components used in the OCS. For example, each of Fresenius Kabi Austria GmbH and Fresenius Kabi AB, which we refer to collectively as Fresenius, is our single-source supplier of OCS Solutions for the OCS Lung and the OCS Heart, respectively. While we have manufacturing and supply agreements with certain of our suppliers, for most of our suppliers, we place purchase orders on an as-needed basis. Our suppliers could discontinue the manufacturing or supply of these components at any time. We do not carry a significant inventory of some of these components. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our demand for their products, either because of acts of nature, the nature of our agreements with those manufacturers or our relative importance to them as a customer, and our manufacturers may decide in the future to discontinue or reduce the level of business they conduct with us. In addition, if these suppliers are unable to deliver components to us, whether due to a labor shortage, slow down or stoppage, or for any other reason, we would be required to seek alternative suppliers. We might not be able to identify and qualify additional or replacement suppliers for any of these components quickly or at all or without incurring significant additional costs. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to establish alternative relationships on similar terms, without delay or at all. We also may choose to establish our own manufacturing process of certain components and we may not be successful in doing so. For example, we will need to seek FDA approval for any component design we choose to manufacture, which may not be granted in a reasonable time, or at all. In addition, the components we design may not be successful or may not provide a functional or economic benefit compared to similar components manufactured by third parties. If we choose to establish our own manufacturing process of components of the OCS, we may be required to procure additional raw materials for such processes, which may not be available. We may also face regulatory delays or be required to seek additional regulatory clearances or approvals if we experience any delay or deficiency in the quality of products obtained from suppliers or if we have to replace our suppliers. In addition, many of the components used in the OCS are specifically designed for use in the OCS, which means that off-the-shelf components may not be available as substitutes.\nEstablishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of these materials or components, if required, or any supply interruption from our suppliers, could limit our ability to manufacture our products, result in production delays and increased costs and adversely affect our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis. Our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components for the OCS also could adversely affect development of the next generation of the OCS. If we are not able to identify alternate sources of supply for the components, we might have to modify our product to use substitute components, which could lead to additional regulatory obligations that could impact our marketing ability, cause delays in shipments, increase design and manufacturing costs and increase prices for our products. Any such modified product might not be as effective as the predecessor product or might not gain market acceptance. This could lead to customer\ndissatisfaction and damage to our reputation and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\nOur results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast customer demand for our products and manage our inventory.\nWe seek to maintain sufficient levels of inventory in order to protect ourselves from supply interruptions, but keep limited components, sub-assemblies, materials and finished products on hand. To ensure adequate inventory supply and manage our operations with our suppliers, we forecast anticipated materials requirements and demand for our products in order to predict inventory needs and then place orders with our suppliers based on these predictions. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products could be negatively affected by many factors, including the rate of transplantations, product recalls, failure to accurately manage our commercial strategy, product introductions by competitors, an increase or decrease in customer demand for our products, our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance of new products, changes to hospital capacity, staffing, procedure and protocol changes, unanticipated changes in general market conditions or regulatory matters and weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions.\nInventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in a portion of our inventory becoming obsolete or expiring, as well as inventory write-downs or write-offs. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand for our products or our own requirements for components, subassemblies and materials, our manufacturing partners and suppliers may not be able to deliver components, sub-assemblies and materials to meet our requirements and our manufacturing may be affected by the impact of COVID-19 on our suppliers, which could result in inadequate inventory levels or interruptions, delays or cancellations of deliveries to our customers, any of which would damage our reputation, customer relationships and business. In addition, several components, sub-assemblies and materials incorporated into our products require lengthy order lead times, and additional supplies or materials may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or our manufacturing partners, or at all, and our manufacturing partners and suppliers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity in order to meet our increased requirements, any of which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand for our products and our results of operations.\nWe will need to increase our manufacturing capacity in the future and may encounter problems at our manufacturing facility or otherwise.\nIn order to manufacture the OCS in quantities sufficient to meet our anticipated commercial opportunity, we will need to increase our manufacturing capabilities. We may encounter technical challenges to increasing the scale at which we manufacture the OCS, including with respect to material procurement and quality control and assurance. An increase in production could make it more difficult for us to comply with quality system regulations or other applicable requirements that are currently enforced by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, or that may be introduced in the future, in both the United States and in other countries. Commercial scale production of the OCS on a continuing basis also will require us to hire and retain additional management and technical personnel who have the necessary manufacturing experience and skills. We might not successfully identify, hire or retain qualified personnel on a timely basis or at all. Our inability to increase the scale of our manufacturing of the OCS could impair our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect market acceptance of our product.\nIn addition, all of our manufacturing operations are conducted at a single facility in Andover, Massachusetts. Any interruption in operations at this location could result in our inability to satisfy product demand. Despite our efforts to safeguard this facility, including acquiring insurance on commercially reasonable terms, adopting environmental health and safety protocols and utilizing off-site storage of computer data, a number of factors could damage or destroy our manufacturing equipment or our inventory of component supplies or finished goods, cause substantial delays in our operations, result in the loss of key information, and cause us to incur additional expenses, including relocation expense, including:\n\u2022\noperating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production imposed by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nequipment malfunctions or failures;\n\u2022\ntechnology malfunctions;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages;\n\u2022\ndamage to or destruction of the facility due to natural disasters or other events; or\n\u2022\nregional or local power shortages.\nOur insurance may not cover our losses in any particular case, or insurance may not be available on commercially reasonable terms to cover certain of these catastrophic events. In addition, regardless of the level of insurance coverage, damage to our facilities or any disruption that impedes our ability to manufacture the OCS in a timely manner could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\nWe may not be able to achieve or maintain satisfactory pricing and margins for our products.\nManufacturers of medical devices have a history of price competition, and we can give no assurance that we will be able to achieve satisfactory prices for our products or maintain prices at the levels we have historically achieved. Any decline in the amount that payors reimburse our customers for OCS Products could make it difficult for customers to continue using, or to adopt, our products and could create additional pricing pressure for us. If we are forced to lower the price we charge for our products, our gross margins will decrease, which will adversely affect our ability to invest in and grow our business. If we are unable to maintain our prices, or if our costs increase and we are unable to offset such increase with an increase in our prices, our margins could erode. We will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressure, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nPrice increases of the components used to manufacture our products and supply shortages could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe supply of raw materials to our component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. We have experienced supply chain disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and continued disruptions to the supply chain could adversely affect our ability to meet commitments to customers. Significant price increases could adversely affect our results of operations and operating margins. In particular, inflation, changes in trade policies, the imposition of duties and tariffs and public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) could adversely impact the price or availability of raw materials and the components of our products. We may not be able to pass along increased component part prices to customers in the form of price increases or our ability to do so could be delayed. Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur failure to compete effectively will harm our business and operating results.\nA broad range of medical device, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies offer products, procedures and therapies that have the potential to limit the demand for organ transplantation. Companies within this group vary depending on the type of organ. New therapies for COPD, which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis, could limit the demand for lung transplants. Alternative products, procedures and therapies including ventricular assist devices, cardiac rhythm management products, total artificial hearts, and drug therapies for the heart and surgical procedures could limit demand for heart transplants. Improved treatments for chronic diseases or conditions affecting the liver as well as efforts to develop artificial livers could limit the need for liver transplants. If demand for organ transplants decreases, sales of the OCS and its components will suffer.\nOther companies may develop technologies and products that result in improved patient outcomes or are safer, easier to use, less expensive or more readily accepted than the OCS. Their products or technologies could make the OCS obsolete or noncompetitive. Many of these providers of alternative products, procedures and therapies have greater name recognition, significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and clearances and marketing and selling products than we do. Smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Third parties may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified medical, engineering and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our products or development programs or otherwise advantageous to our business. Our failure to compete effectively will harm our business and operating results.\nThe clinical trial process required to obtain future regulatory approvals is lengthy and expensive, with uncertain outcomes.\nClinical trials are necessary to support PMA applications and may be necessary to support future PMA supplements for modified versions of our marketed device products. Conducting clinical trials is a complex and expensive process, can take many years and outcomes are inherently uncertain. For the development of the next generation of OCS products, we may incur substantial expense for, and devote significant time to, clinical trials but cannot be certain that the product tested will ever generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of trials. We may experience significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials showed promising results, and failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. Any of our products may malfunction or may produce undesirable adverse effects that could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials. We, the FDA or another regulatory authority may suspend or terminate clinical trials.\nSuccessful results in early studies do not assure positive results in subsequent clinical trials. The data we collect from our preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be sufficient to support FDA or other regulatory clearance or approval. Additionally, the FDA may disagree with our interpretation of the data from our studies and trials. The FDA may conclude that the clinical trial design, conduct or results are inadequate to prove safety or effectiveness, and the FDA may require us to undertake expensive and lengthy additional trials, which may delay clearance or approval of products.\nClinical trials often require enrollment of large numbers of subjects, who may be difficult to identify, recruit and maintain as participants in the clinical trial. As a condition to our PMA approvals, we are required to conduct post-market studies. Adverse outcomes in post-approval studies can result in withdrawal of approval of a PMA or restrictions on the approval. We will need to conduct additional clinical studies to support use of the OCS in, and development of OCS products for, new organs, like kidney, and potentially for commercialization of our products in additional foreign jurisdictions. Clinical trials in organ transplant are difficult to design and implement, take substantial time to conduct and are expensive. The results of clinical trials are inherently uncertain. The initiation and completion of any studies may be prevented, delayed or halted for numerous reasons. The following could adversely affect the costs, timing or successful completion of any clinical trial:\n\u2022\nwe have been required and, prior to collecting clinical data in the future to support new PMA applications, may be required again to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials, and the FDA may reject our IDE application and notify us that we may not begin investigational trials;\n\u2022\nregulators and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree as to the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nregulators and/or IRBs, or other reviewing bodies may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial, or to conduct or continue a clinical trial at a prospective or specific trial site;\n\u2022\nwe may not reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different trial sites;\n\u2022\nclinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\nthe number of subjects or patients required for clinical trials may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be insufficient or slower than we anticipate, and the number of clinical trials being conducted at any given time may be high and result in fewer available patients for any given clinical trial, or patients may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nour third-party contractors, including those manufacturing products, may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner or at all;\n\u2022\nwe might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nwe may have to amend clinical trial protocols or conduct additional studies to reflect changes in regulatory requirements or guidance, which we may be required to submit to an IRB and/or regulatory authorities for re-examination;\n\u2022\nregulators, IRBs or other reviewing bodies may require or recommend that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including safety signals or noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to recruit a sufficient number of clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nregulators, IRBs or other reviewing bodies may fail to approve or subsequently find fault with our manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we enter into agreement for clinical and commercial supplies, the supply of devices or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials may be insufficient, inadequate or not available at an acceptable cost, or we may experience interruptions in supply;\n\u2022\napproval policies or regulations of FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agencies may change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval; and\n\u2022\nour current or future products may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics.\nFailure can occur at any stage of clinical testing. For example, our clinical studies may produce negative or inconclusive results, and, in the future, we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct clinical and non-clinical testing in addition to those we have planned. After submission of our PMA applications for OCS Lung and OCS Heart, the FDA requested certain additional clinical analyses, technical information and clarifications as part of the agency\u2019s normal review process. The FDA ultimately approved both PMAs. The FDA could ask us to conduct additional clinical trials or submit additional evidence to support PMA applications in the future. Our failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of any product we may develop in the future would prevent receipt of regulatory clearance or approval and, ultimately, the commercialization of that product or indication for use. Even if our future products are cleared or approved in the United States, commercialization of our products in foreign countries would require marketing authorization from regulatory authorities in those countries. Authorization approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Operations and Business\nFailure to maintain an ethical and inclusive corporate culture, or damage to our reputation, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe strive to create a culture in which our employees act with integrity, treat each other with respect and consider themselves empowered to report suspected misconduct. Our ability to attract and retain a high-quality workforce depends upon our commitment to a diverse and inclusive environment, along with our perceived trustworthiness and ethics. Issues can arise in any number of circumstances, including employment-related offenses such as workplace harassment and discrimination, regulatory noncompliance, and failure to properly use and protect data and systems, as well as from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct. Addressing allegations of misconduct detracts focus from business operations and is expensive. We have adopted policies to promote compliance with laws and regulations as well as to foster a respectful workplace for all employees. These policies, which include a code of business conduct and ethics, an insider trading policy, a Regulation FD policy, a sexual harassment policy, a regulated fraternization policy, and a whistleblower policy, are a component of our effort to minimize employee misconduct as well as activities that frequently result in allegations of misconduct, but our employees may fail to abide by these policies. In addition to damaging our reputation, actual or alleged misconduct could affect the confidence of our shareholders, regulators and other parties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFailure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyber-based attacks, network security breaches or data corruption could materially disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage sales and marketing data, accounting and financial functions, inventory management, product development tasks, clinical data, donor and patient data, customer service and technical support functions. Our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural disasters; terrorist attacks; cyber-based attacks; attacks by computer viruses or hackers; power losses, computer system or data network failures; security breaches and data corruption. The failure of either our or our service providers\u2019 information technology could disrupt our entire operation or result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs and product shortages, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects. In addition, our software systems include cloud-based applications that are hosted by third-party service providers with security and information technology systems subject to similar risks.\nAs the cyber-threat landscape evolves, attacks are growing in frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. New and expanding threats to our information systems, including computer viruses, ransomware and phishing attacks and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks, as well as cybersecurity failures resulting from human error and technological errors, pose a risk to the security of our systems and the systems of our customers, business partners and suppliers, as well the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the data we process. In addition, there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity, including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance and human or technological error.\nWe also have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations or customer-imposed controls. Despite our implementation of controls to protect our systems and sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, employee errors and/or malfeasance (including misappropriation by departing employees) that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information.\nWhile we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training and maintenance of protective systems, such measures may not prove adequate to prevent cyberattacks, and we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. The impact from such threats could be material. A significant cybersecurity incident could result in a range of potentially material negative consequences for us, including lost revenue; unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss or destruction of company systems or data; theft of sensitive, regulated or confidential data, such as personal identifying information or our intellectual property; the loss of functionality of critical systems through ransomware, denial of service or other attacks; business delays, service or system disruptions, damage to equipment and injury to persons or property, and increased insurance premiums. The costs and operational consequences of defending against, preparing for, responding to and remediating an incident may be substantial. Further, we could be exposed to litigation, regulatory enforcement or other legal action as a result of an incident, carrying the potential for damages, fines, sanctions or other penalties, as well injunctive relief requiring costly compliance measures. A cybersecurity incident could also impact our brand, harm our reputation and adversely impact our relationship with our customers, employees and stockholders.\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and our results of operations.\nBecause we market the OCS in countries in Europe, Asia-Pacific, Central Asia and Canada and plan to market it in other international markets, we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, 28% and 25%, respectively, of our net revenue was generated from customers located outside of the United States. We anticipate that international sales will continue to represent a meaningful portion of our total sales. In addition, some of our employees and suppliers are located outside of the United States. Accordingly, our results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions, including any potential impact resulting from the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ndifferent or changing regulatory or insurance practices regarding reimbursement for transplant procedures;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in developing effective marketing campaigns in unfamiliar foreign countries;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements or customs clearance and shipping delays;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ndiffering tax laws and changes in those laws in the countries in which we are subject to tax, or potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value-added tax systems, tax inefficiencies related to our corporate structure, and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nchanges in international legislation or regulations governing the approval or clearance process for the OCS or ongoing compliance requirements;\n\u2022\ndiffering business practices associated with foreign operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing our international operations;\n\u2022\npolitical, social, and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks, and security concerns in general;\n\u2022\nthe burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different legal standards, such as anti-bribery laws, including the FCPA, and UK Bribery Act of 2010, or the Bribery Act, data privacy requirements, labor laws and anti-competition regulations;\n\u2022\ndiffering protection of intellectual property; and\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities.\nWe rely on shipping providers to deliver products to our customers globally. Labor, tariff or World Trade Organization-related disputes, piracy, physical damage to shipping facilities or equipment caused by severe weather or terrorist incidents, congestion at shipping facilities, inadequate equipment to load, dock and offload our products, energy-related tie-ups, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors could disrupt or delay shipping or off-loading of our products domestically and internationally. Such disruptions or delays could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\nIf one or more of these risks are realized, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain our founder and President and Chief Executive Officer and other members of our management team and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nOur success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified clinicians, surgeons, scientists, engineers, managers and sales personnel. Dr. Waleed H. Hassanein, our founder and President and Chief Executive Officer, and other members of our management team are important to the success of our operations and to our efforts to develop and commercialize the OCS. All of these key employees, including Dr. Hassanein, are at-will employees and can terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of any of these key members of our management team and, in particular, Dr. Hassanein, could impede our achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives. In addition, it will be an event of default under our Credit Agreement if Dr. Hassanein ceases to be our President and Chief Executive Officer and we do not hire a replacement that is reasonably acceptable to OrbiMed within 120 days. We maintain $1.0 million of \u201ckey person\u201d insurance policy on the life of Dr. Hassanein, but we do not maintain such insurance on any of our other employees.\nIn addition, our expected growth will require us to hire a significant number of qualified personnel, including clinical development, regulatory, sales, marketing, engineering, scientific, clinical support and administrative personnel. There is intense competition from other companies and research and academic institutions for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities. If we cannot continue to attract and retain, on acceptable terms, the qualified personnel necessary for the continued development of our business, we might not be able to sustain our operations or become profitable.\nThe failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business.\nTo manage our anticipated future growth effectively, we must enhance our manufacturing capabilities, information technology infrastructure and financial and accounting systems and controls. Our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of the OCS for transplants involving additional indications or other organs, such as kidney. Our National OCS Program, a turnkey solution to provide outsourced organ retrieval and OCS organ management, may also require additional capital expenditures. If we are unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our revenue could grow more slowly than expected and we might not be able to achieve our research and development and commercialization goals, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\nIf we pursue acquisitions, such acquisitions may expose us to additional risks.\nWe may review acquisition and strategic investment opportunities to expand our current product offerings, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms. If required, the financing for these transactions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our shareholders or both. The purchase price for some acquisitions may include additional amounts to be paid in cash in the future, a portion of which may be contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results of the acquired business. If the performance of any such acquired business exceeds such operating results, then we may incur additional charges and be required to pay additional amounts.\nOur failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business or to achieve the long-term plan for such business, as well as any other adverse consequences associated with our acquisition and investment activities, could have an adverse effect on our business. Any acquisition may also disrupt our ongoing business, divert resources, increase our expenses, and distract our management from our ongoing operations.\nThe outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) impacts our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, including efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus, has impacted, and may continue to impact, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, including as a result of the impact of new variants. Impacts to our business as a result of COVID-19 have included the temporary disruption of transplant procedures at many of the organ transplant centers who purchase OCS products; customer delays or reductions in customer capital expenditures and operating budgets and the related impact on our product sales; disruptions to our manufacturing operations and supply chain caused by facility closures, reductions in operating hours, staggered shifts and other social distancing efforts; labor shortages; decreased productivity and unavailability of materials or components; delays of reviews and approvals by the FDA and other health authorities; delays in our clinical trial enrollment; limitations on our employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 ability to travel; and delays in product installations, trainings or shipments to and from other affected countries and within the United States.\nIn the event that governmental authorities introduce new restrictions, our employees conducting manufacturing activities may not be able to access our manufacturing facilities, and our core activities may be significantly limited or curtailed, possibly for an extended period of time. We also may face limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on our commercial, manufacturing or clinical activities, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people.\nIn response to the pandemic, healthcare providers have, and may need to further, reallocate resources, such as physicians, staff, hospital beds and intensive care unit facilities, as they prioritize limited resources and personnel capacity to focus on the treatment of patients with COVID-19. These actions significantly delay the provision of other medical care such as organ transplantation and reduce the number of transplant procedures that are performed, which negatively impacts our revenue and cash flows. These measures and challenges may continue for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted, and may continue to impact, our third party suppliers, including through the effects of facility closures, reductions in operating hours, staggered shifts and other social distancing efforts, labor shortages, decreased productivity and unavailability of materials or components. While we maintain an inventory of finished products and raw materials used in our OCS products, a further prolonged pandemic could lead to shortages in the raw materials necessary to manufacture our products. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts operations of our third-party\npartners will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. If we experience a prolonged disruption in our manufacturing, supply chains, or commercial operations, we would expect to experience a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we infringe or are alleged to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties or are otherwise subject to litigation or other proceedings regarding our intellectual property rights, our business or competitive position could be adversely affected.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on not infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the patents or other intellectual property or proprietary rights of others. Significant litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights occurs in the medical device industry. Third parties may claim that the OCS or aspects or uses of the OCS infringe intellectual property rights for which we do not hold licenses or other rights in the United States and abroad. Third parties in both the United States and abroad may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our products.\nGiven the vast number of patents in our field of technology, we cannot be certain that we do not infringe existing patents or that we will not infringe patents that may be granted in the future. For example, patent applications in the United States and elsewhere can be pending for many years before issuance, or unintentionally abandoned patents or applications can be revived, so there may be applications of others now pending or recently revived patents of which we are unaware. These applications may later result in issued patents, or the revival of previously abandoned patents, that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products. Third parties may, in the future, assert claims that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization, including claims from competitors or from non-practicing entities that have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may have no deterrent effect. As we continue to commercialize our products in their current or updated forms, launch new products and enter new markets, competitors may claim that one or more of our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of business strategies designed to impede our successful commercialization and entry into new markets. The large number of patents, the rapid rate of new patent applications and issuances, the complexities of the technology involved, and the uncertainty of litigation may increase the risk of business resources and management\u2019s attention being diverted to patent litigation.\nIf any third-party patents were asserted against us, even if we believe such claims are without merit, there is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement, validity, enforceability, or priority. A court of competent jurisdiction could hold that the asserted third-party patents are valid, enforceable, and infringed, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any U.S. patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity. As this burden is a high one requiring us to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of any such U.S. patent claim, there is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction would invalidate the claims of any such U.S. patent. We may choose or, if we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s patent rights and we are unsuccessful in demonstrating that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing, manufacturing, and marketing any of our products. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors and other third parties access to the same technologies licensed to us, and it could require us to make substantial licensing and royalty payments. We also could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing, and commercializing the infringing technology or products. In addition, we could be found liable for significant monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearing, motions, or other interim developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur industry has experienced substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights and lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nIn addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other types of patent litigation and other proceedings, including post-grant proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to the OCS. For\nexample, we may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in post-grant review procedures, oppositions, derivations, reexaminations, inter partes review or interference proceedings, in the United States or elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time.\nIn addition, competitors and other third parties may infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our patents and other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming and divert the time and attention of our management. In addition, many of our adversaries in these proceedings may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we can.\nA court may disagree with our allegations and may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the third-party technology in question. Furthermore, the other party could counterclaim that we infringe their intellectual property or counterclaim that a patent we have asserted against them is invalid or unenforceable, or both. In patent litigation in the United States, counterclaims challenging the validity, enforceability or scope of asserted patents are commonplace. Similarly, third parties may initiate legal proceedings against us seeking a declaration that certain of our intellectual property rights are non-infringed, invalid, or unenforceable. The outcome of any such proceeding is generally unpredictable.\nAn adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability of our patents covering one of our products, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection covering such product. Competing products may also be sold in other countries in which our patent coverage might not exist or be as strong. Any of these outcomes would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBecause of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearing, motions, or other interim developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock. Even if we ultimately prevail, a court may decide not to grant an injunction against further infringing activity and instead award only monetary damages, which may not be an adequate remedy. Furthermore, the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management could outweigh any benefit we receive as a result of the proceedings. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to establish, maintain or adequately protect our intellectual property rights relating to the OCS, the commercial value of the OCS will be adversely affected and our competitive position could be harmed.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part upon our ability to establish and maintain intellectual property rights covering the OCS in the United States and other countries. We own or have an exclusive license under several patents and patent applications in the United States and corresponding patents and patent applications in a number of foreign jurisdictions. All but one of the issued United States patents under the VA license expired in 2017 and the issued international patents expired in 2018. However, we have requested patent term extension for one U.S. patent covered by the VA license agreement, U.S. Patent No. 6,100,082. We have been granted an interim patent term extension until November 6, 2021. We have not received final approval of the patent extension beyond the interim patent already requested. The maximum extensions granted would be through May 2022; however, the length of the patent term extension will be determined by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, based on input from the FDA. On February 8, 2021, the FDA provided to the USPTO a determined regulatory review period for the OCS Lung. Under the FDA\u2019s analysis, the patent term extension of the \u2019082 patent would be until November 6, 2021. We have not received communication from the USPTO, but expect that the USPTO\u2019s patent term extension for the \u2018082 patent will maintain the November 6, 2021 expiration date. With respect to the patents and patent applications that we own, any patents that have or may issue from our currently issued or pending patent applications would be expected to expire between 2025 and 2036, assuming all required fees are paid.\nHowever, we cannot provide any assurances that any of our patents have, or that any of our pending patent applications that mature into issued patents will include, claims with a scope sufficient to protect our OCS technology, any additional features we develop for our OCS technology or any new products. Other parties may have developed technologies that may be related to or competitive with our system, may have filed or may file patent applications and may have received or may receive patents that overlap or conflict with our patent applications, either by claiming the same methods or devices or by claiming subject matter that could dominate our patent position. The patent positions of medical device companies, including our patent position, may involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, the scope, validity and enforceability of any patent claims that we may obtain cannot be predicted with certainty. Our pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. Even if issued, our patents may be challenged, narrowed, held unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented, or others could challenge the inventorship, ownership or enforceability of our patents and patent applications, any of which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the term of patent protection we may have for our products, or cause us to lose our right to manufacture, market and sell the OCS products or components of the OCS products. Additionally, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art, and provide more efficient and cost-effective avenues for competitors to challenge the validity of patents. In addition, the Leahy-Smith Act has transformed the U.S. patent system into a first-to-file system. The first-to-file provisions became effective on March 16, 2013. It is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. For example, the Leahy-Smith Act provides that an administrative tribunal known as the Patent Trial and Appeals Board, or PTAB, provides a venue for challenging the validity of patents at a cost that is much lower than district court litigation and on timelines that are much faster. Proceedings challenging our patents could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. Furthermore, an adverse decision in an interference proceeding can result in a third party receiving the patent right sought by us, which in turn could affect our ability to commercialize our products.\nChanges in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection, which in turn could diminish the commercial value of the OCS. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u2022\nany of our patents, or any of our pending patent applications, if issued, will include claims having a scope sufficient to protect the OCS;\n\u2022\nany of our pending patent applications will issue as patents;\n\u2022\nwe will be able to successfully commercialize our products on a substantial scale, if approved, before any relevant patents we may have expire;\n\u2022\nwe were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our patents and pending patent applications;\n\u2022\nwe were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nothers will not develop similar or alternative technologies that do not infringe our patents; any of our patents will be found to ultimately be valid and enforceable;\n\u2022\nany patents issued to us will provide a basis for an exclusive market for our commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u2022\nwe will develop additional proprietary technologies or products that are separately patentable; or\n\u2022\nour commercial activities or products will not infringe upon the patents of others.\nIf we are unable to obtain patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our products, one or more of the U.S. patents we own or license may be eligible for limited patent term restoration under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. For example, we currently have a pending patent term extension request based on the recently approved OCS Lung that, if granted, would increase the term of one of our patents by up to five years, through May 2022. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, even if, at the relevant time, we have an issued patent covering our product, we may not be granted an extension if we were, for example, to fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, to fail to apply within applicable deadlines or prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise to fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the time period of the extension or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. Only one patent per approved product can be extended, the extension cannot extend the total patent term beyond 14 years from approval and only those claims covering the approved product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for the applicable product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration. As a result, our ability to generate revenue could be materially adversely affected. Further, if this occurs, our competitors may take advantage of our investment in development and trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case. If we do not have adequate patent protection or other exclusivity for our products, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. This could make it difficult for us to stop infringement of our foreign patents, if obtained, or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, some foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, some countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of our intellectual property.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of the OCS and our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely upon trade secret protection, as well as non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties, to protect our confidential and proprietary information. In addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using commonly accepted physical and technological security measures. Such measures may not, for example, in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third party with authorized access, provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to copy or reverse engineer certain aspects of our products that we consider proprietary. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Even though we use commonly accepted security measures, trade secret violations are often a matter of state law, and the criteria for protection of trade secrets can vary among different jurisdictions. In addition, trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. We also have agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties that obligate them to assign inventions made in the course of their work for us to us, however\nthese agreements may not be self-executing, not all employees or consultants may enter into such agreements, or employees or consultants may breach or violate the terms of these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation. If any of our intellectual property or confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor, the value of the OCS and our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees have misappropriated the intellectual property of a third party, including trade secrets or know-how, or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors and third parties may claim an ownership interest in intellectual property we regard as our own.\nMany of our employees and consultants were previously employed at or engaged by other medical device, biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors, hospitals or other third parties. Some of these employees, consultants and contractors may have executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the intellectual property, proprietary information, know-how or trade secrets of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these individuals have, inadvertently or otherwise, misappropriated the intellectual property or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information, of these former employers, competitors or other third parties. Additionally, we may be subject to claims from third parties challenging our ownership interest in or inventorship of intellectual property we regard as our own, based on claims that our agreements with employees or consultants obligating them to assign intellectual property to us are ineffective or in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations to assign inventions to another employer, to a former employer, or to another person or entity. Litigation may be necessary to defend against claims, and it may be necessary or we may desire to enter into a license to settle any such claim; however, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If our defense to those claims fails, in addition to paying monetary damages or a settlement payment, a court could prohibit us from using technologies, features or other intellectual property that are essential to our products, if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. An inability to incorporate technologies, features or other intellectual property that are important or essential to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business and competitive position, and may prevent us from selling our products. In addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and could be a distraction to management. Any litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees or contract with independent sales representatives. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our products, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nIf we fail to maintain necessary FDA approval for the OCS, or obtain necessary FDA approval for future uses of the OCS, we will not be able to commercially sell and market the OCS.\nThe OCS products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation in the United States by the FDA and other federal, state and local authorities. The FDA regulates the design, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, selling, promoting, distributing, importing, exporting and shipping of the OCS. As of September 2021, we have obtained a PMA for each of the OCS Lung, OCS Liver and OCS Heart.\nUnforeseen requirements or delays in obtaining clearances or approvals from the FDA for any future indications of the OCS or future products could result in unexpected and significant costs for us and consume management\u2019s time and other resources. The COVID-19 pandemic may result in delayed review and approval timelines. The pandemic has and may continue to cause disruptions in global regulatory agencies\u2019 daily operations. Any delay in regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially affect our development and commercialization plans, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable and difficult to assess.\nPMA approval could be withdrawn or other restrictions imposed if post- market data demonstrate safety issues or inadequate performance. For 510(k) cleared devices, the FDA can use its enforcement authorities to require removal of a device from the market in case of safety issues.\nIf we are not able to maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for the OCS, or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for future products on a timely basis or at all, our financial condition and results of operations would suffer, possibly materially, and our business might fail.\nIf we fail to maintain the CE Mark in the European Union, Northern Ireland and the UKCA mark (as applicable) in Great Britain, we will not be able to commercially sell and market the OCS in the EU.\nIn the European Union, we have the right to affix a CE Mark for the sale of the OCS Lung, OCS Heart and OCS Liver for lung, heart and liver transplants, respectively. Our notified body, BSI is based in the Netherlands and issues the certificates that allow CE marking of the OCS products. We have CE Marks for each of the OCS Heart, the OCS Lung, and the OCS Liver, which were renewed in September 2017. These CE Marks are valid for five years, so they will expire in September 2022. In order to be able to continue to use the CE Mark in the same manner during the transitional period, we will have to meet the conditions set out in the transitional provisions in the MDR.\nPost-Brexit the MDR applies in Northern Ireland in accordance with the Northern Irish Protocol but does not apply in Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland). The UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 provided a transitional period under which the UK will recognize EU CE marks until June 30, 2023. To be placed on the market in Great Britain after this date, medical devices must have undergone a conformity assessment in accordance with the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 and have the UKCA mark affixed. However, even devices that benefit from the transition period must still comply with the other requirements of the UK Medical Devices Regulations; for example, there are broader registration requirements with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or the MHRA, and if the manufacturer is located outside the UK, a UK Responsible Person must be appointed. To continue to place products on the market in the European Union and United Kingdom after expiry of our existing notified body certificate, we will need to apply for their re-certification under the new MDR. We might not be able to continue to place the devices on the market in the European Union and/or United Kingdom for any current use of the OCS. If:\n\u2022\nwe are not able to obtain re-certification of our products for their current use under the MDR and/or obtain cortication under the UK Medical Devices Regulations when required;\n\u2022\nwe are not able to do so in time before the certificates expire;\n\u2022\nour technical files for our products do not meet the new (and more stringent) requirements under the Medical Devices Regulation; or\n\u2022\nany variation in the uses for which the CE Mark has been affixed to the OCS requires us to perform further research or to modify the technical documentation required to affix the CE mark, our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed.\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions, our market opportunities will be limited.\nFDA clearance or approval or a CE mark does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries. However, the failure to obtain clearance or approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain clearance or approval elsewhere. If we do not obtain or maintain necessary market authorizations to commercialize our products in markets outside the United States, it would negatively affect our overall market penetration. For example, if, as a result of manufacturing error, the efficacy of our products does not meet the standards claimed in the accompanying instructions for use, regulatory authorities could prevent our products from being placed on the market in the European Union, Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\nAdditionally, we have appointed a UK responsible person and have registered with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the UK.\nIf transplant centers and hospitals cannot obtain adequate reimbursement or funding from governments or third-party payors for purchases of the OCS and additional disposable sets and for costs associated with procedures that use the OCS, our prospects for generating revenue and achieving profitability will suffer materially.\nOur prospects for generating revenue and achieving profitability depend heavily upon the availability of adequate reimbursement or funding in both the United States and other markets for purchases of the OCS and for organ transplant procedures that use the OCS.\nIn the United States, Medicare generally reimburses the facilities in which transplant procedures are performed based upon prospectively determined amounts. For hospital inpatient treatment, the Medicare prospective payment generally is determined by the patient\u2019s condition and other patient data and procedures performed during the patient\u2019s hospital stay, using a classification system known as MS-DRGs. Prospective rates are adjusted for, among other things, regional differences and whether the hospital is a teaching hospital. Because prospective payments are based on predetermined rates and may be less than a hospital\u2019s actual costs in furnishing care, hospitals have incentives to lower their inpatient operating costs by utilizing products, devices and supplies that will reduce the length of patients\u2019 hospital stays, decrease labor or otherwise lower their costs.\nIn addition to these MS-DRG-based payments, Medicare reimburses transplant centers for \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d organ acquisition costs, which are considered \u201cpass-through\u201d costs from the prospective payment system, and are not based on the payments for the applicable MS-DRG. Pass-through organ acquisition costs include services required for the acquisition of an organ, such as tissue typing, organ preservation, transport of organs, donor evaluation and other acquisition costs. The separate payments for these costs are determined on a reasonable cost basis established through the transplant center\u2019s Medicare cost report. During OCS clinical trials, even before the OCS had been approved by the FDA, the Medicare program reimbursed transplant centers for their use of the OCS for lung, heart and liver transplantation. We believe, though cannot be assured, that the costs incurred by transplant centers for the organ-specific OCS Console, OCS Perfusion Sets and OCS Solutions will be classified as organ acquisition costs for which Medicare will provide additional reimbursement. However, Medicare does not reimburse for items determined not to be reasonable and necessary for diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury. The CMS and Medicare contractors who administer Medicare around the country have substantial discretion in determining whether the OCS is reasonable and necessary in this context. Either CMS or a Medicare contractor might determine that Medicare will not cover and reimburse for the cost of the OCS in the absence of reliable clinical data evidencing the benefits to patients of the use of the OCS. The data we collect from our prior, ongoing and planned clinical studies and patient registry may not be sufficient for this purpose in a coverage determination by CMS or a Medicare contractor. Accordingly, Medicare might not reimburse transplant centers for all or a portion of the cost of the OCS. We believe that private insurers and other public insurers in the United States generally will follow the coverage and payment policies of Medicare.\nOutside of the United States, reimbursement and funding systems vary significantly by country, and within some countries, by region. Many foreign markets have government managed healthcare systems that govern reimbursement and funding for medical devices and procedures. In the European Union member states, the costs associated with organ transplant procedures may be paid for by national insurance and in some cases private insurers or by both national insurance and private insurers, depending on the priorities established by individual programs. These reimbursement arrangements are subject to complex rules and regulations at the national and regional levels that can vary between member states of the European Union and are likely to require that we demonstrate that the OCS is superior to existing preservation methods. We have no studies currently planned to collect such clinical data, and any studies of this kind likely would be expensive and lengthy and may not ultimately produce results adequate to secure reimbursement. In some cases, we might not be able to secure adequate reimbursement for the OCS at all or until we have collected additional clinical data supporting the benefits associated with the use of the OCS in transplant procedures. Hospitals or surgeons in countries or regions where separate additional reimbursement or funding for the OCS is not available may determine that the benefits of the OCS do not or will not outweigh the cost of the OCS. Alternatively, we may be required to enter into risk sharing arrangements with payers.\nAdoption of our products in the European Union may be hindered if they impede our customer\u2019s compliance with the requirements of Directive 2010/53/EU (formerly Directive 2010/45/EU), and the Quality and Safety of Organs Intended for Transplantation Regulations 2012 (Statutory Instrument (SI) 2012 No. 1501) (the Regulations) in the United Kingdom which imposes certain standards on procurement, preservation and transport of organs intended for transplantation. Even where reimbursement or funding is available, in some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, the pricing of medical devices is subject to governmental control. In these countries, reimbursement and pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the CE marking of a product. For example, some foreign reimbursement systems provide for limited payments in a given period and, therefore, result in extended payment periods, which could hinder\nadoption of the OCS for use in transplantation, limiting sales. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, it may not be profitable to sell our products in certain foreign countries, which could negatively affect the long-term growth of our business.\nEven if existing reimbursement and funding arrangements of governmental programs and other third-party payors provide for sufficient payments to make purchases of the OCS cost-effective for hospitals, the laws and regulations governing these arrangements are subject to change. The continuing efforts of governments, insurance companies and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce these costs could lead to legislative or regulatory reform of the United States or foreign reimbursement and funding systems in a manner that significantly reduces or eliminates reimbursement for the OCS or for transplant procedures.\nIf hospitals in the United States or the European Union are not able to obtain reimbursement or funding for the cost of the OCS and additional disposable sets or for transplant procedures generally, they may not have sufficient economic incentives to purchase the OCS. If hospitals or surgeons determine that the benefits of the OCS do not or will not outweigh the initial cost and ongoing expense of the OCS, we might fail to achieve significant sales and may never become profitable.\nReimbursement in international markets is likely to require us to undertake country-specific reimbursement activities, including additional clinical studies, which could be time-consuming and expensive and may not yield acceptable reimbursement rates.\nIn international markets, market acceptance of our products will likely depend in large part on the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems. Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country, and by region in some countries, and include both government-sponsored healthcare and private insurance. We may not obtain international reimbursement approvals in a timely manner, if at all. In addition, even if we do obtain international reimbursement approvals, the level of reimbursement may not be enough to commercially justify expansion of our business into the approving jurisdiction. To the extent we or our customers are unable to obtain reimbursement for products in major international markets in which we seek to market and sell our products, our international revenue growth would be harmed, and our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we modify our products, we may be required to obtain approval of new PMAs or PMA supplements, vary existing CE Marking, and may be required to cease marketing or recall any modified products until the required approvals are obtained.\nCertain modifications to a PMA-approved device require approval of a new PMA or a PMA supplement, while other modifications can be reported in an annual report or through a 30-day Notice. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether a new PMA or PMA supplement is necessary. We may make modifications to our approved devices and manufacturing processes in the future that we believe do not require approval of a new PMA application or PMA supplement, or submission of a 30-day Notice. If the FDA disagrees with our determination and requires us to submit a new PMA, PMA supplement or 30-day Notice for modifications to our previously approved products or manufacturing processes, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain approval or submit the 30-day Notice, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. In addition, the FDA may not approve our products for the indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization or could require clinical trials to support any modification to the device or our modified indications or claims. Any delay or failure in obtaining required approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth.\nAdditionally, any significant change to the quality system or the product range in relation to a CE Marked device will require notification to the notified body which certified the product. The notified body will assess the proposed change. We might not be able to have the CE Mark varied without taking additional steps, or at all. For example, we might need to conduct additional clinical trials and provide additional technical information to the appropriate notified body before the CE Mark can be affixed to the changed product. Additionally, devices that are relying on a notified body certificate under the Medical Devices Directive under the MDR transition period will no longer benefit from the transition period if significant changes are made to the design and/or intended purpose of the device. If we make such changes we would need to CE Mark the devices under the MDR in order to continue to place them on the market in the European Union and/or United Kingdom.\nEven after approval for the OCS, we are subject to continuing regulation by regulatory authorities and entities in the United States and other countries, and if we fail to comply with any of these regulations, our business could suffer.\nEven after approval of the OCS for a specific indication, we are subject to extensive continuing regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities and entities. We are subject to Medical Device Reporting regulations, which require us to report to the FDA if we become aware of information that reasonably suggests our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device we market would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. We must report corrections and removals to the FDA where the correction or removal was initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device that may present a risk to health, and maintain records of other corrections or removals. The FDA closely regulates promotion and advertising and all claims that we make for the OCS. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials, training or advertising activities constitute promotion of an unapproved use of the OCS, it could request that we cease or modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions.\nThe FDA and state authorities have broad enforcement powers. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement actions by the FDA or state agencies, which may include any of the following sanctions:\n\u2022\nuntitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022\nrecall, termination of distribution, administrative detention, injunction or seizure of organ-specific OCS Consoles or disposable sets;\n\u2022\ncustomer notifications or repair, replacement or refunds;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\nrefusing or delaying our requests for premarket approval of new products or for modifications to existing products, and refusing or delaying our requests for PMAs for new intended uses of the OCS;\n\u2022\nwithdrawing or suspending PMA approvals that have already been granted, resulting in prohibitions on sales of our products;\n\u2022\nFDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; and\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nAny corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as potentially defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nFor our currently marketed OCS Lung, OCS Heart and OCS Liver, as part of the conditions of approval, we must complete PMA post-approval studies. For example, three post-approval studies must be competed for OCS Lung including, the OCS Lung INSPIRE Continuation PAS, which is a two-arm observational study intended to evaluate long-term outcomes of the OCS Lung INSPIRE Trial patients, the OCS Lung EXPAND Continuation PAS, which is a single arm study intended to evaluate long-term outcomes of the OCS Lung EXPAND Trial patients, and our OCS Lung Thoracic Organ Perfusion PAS Registry, or TOP Registry, which is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, observational study designed to evaluate short- and long-term safety and effectiveness of the OCS Lung for both donor lungs currently utilized and unutilized for transplantation. The OCS Lung INSPIRE Continuation PAS, the OCS Lung EXPAND Continuation PAS and the TOP Registry entail submission of regular reports to the FDA. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.\nWe also are required to comply with strict post-marketing obligations that accompany the affixing of the CE Mark to medical devices in the European Union. These include the obligation to report incidents which meet the criteria for reporting, and to provide periodic safety update reports and trend reports. Additionally, national competent authorities in the European Union also closely monitor the marketing programs implemented by device companies. The obligations that companies must fulfill concerning premarketing approval of promotional material vary among member states of the European Union. A\nfailure to comply with our obligations in marketing and promoting the OCS in the European Union could harm our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, certain changes and other events with respect to regulatory approvals may cause an event of default under our Credit Agreement, including the initiation of a regulatory enforcement action or issuance of a warning letter with respect to the Company or any of its products or manufacturing facilities that causes the discontinuance of marketing or withdrawal of any products or causes delay in manufacturing. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis -Long-Term Debt,\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf we fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR, or FDA or EU requirements that pertain to clinical trials or investigations, the FDA or the relevant EU competent authority could take various enforcement actions, including halting our manufacturing operations, and our business would suffer.\nIn the United States, as a manufacturer of a medical device, we are required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the FDA\u2019s QSR. The QSR is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of medical devices. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic inspections and unannounced \u201cfor cause\u201d inspections.\nWe are subject to periodic FDA inspections to determine compliance with QSR and pursuant to the Bioresearch Monitoring Program, which have in the past and may in the future result in the FDA issuing Form 483s, including during the conduct of clinical trials. Outside the United States, our products and operations are also often required to comply with standards set by industrial standards bodies, such as the International Organization for Standardization. For example, in the European Union the MDR includes detailed requirements for clinical investigations, which are in line with the international standard ISO 14155:2011 on good clinical practical, or GCP. Foreign regulatory bodies may evaluate our products or the testing that our products undergo against these standards. The specific standards, types of evaluation and scope of review differ among foreign regulatory bodies. Our failure to comply with FDA or local requirements that pertain to clinical trials/investigations, including GCP requirements, and the QSR (in the United States), or failure to take satisfactory and prompt corrective action in response to an adverse inspection, could result in enforcement actions, including a warning letter, adverse publicity, a shutdown of or restrictions on our manufacturing operations, delays in approving or clearing our products, refusal to permit the import or export of our product, prohibition on sales of our product, a recall or seizure of our products, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, or other sanctions, any of which could cause our business and operating results to suffer.\nOur products have been and may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\nThe OCS must be manufactured in accordance with federal and state regulations, and we or any of our suppliers or third-party manufacturers could be forced to recall our installed systems or terminate production if we fail to comply with these regulations. The FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design, manufacture or labeling. In the case of the FDA, the recall order must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death. In addition, foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, security failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The FDA requires that recalls initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device that may present a risk to health be reported to the FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. Companies are required to maintain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, we could be required to report those actions as recalls. A recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. Additionally, any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted, including warning letters, untitled letters, administrative actions, criminal prosecution, imposition of civil monetary penalties, revocation of our device approval, seizure of our products or delay in clearance or approval of future products.\nWe have voluntarily recalled certain OCS products from customer sites in the past and may need to take similar actions in the future, which may result in notices to regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions.\nInternationally, the approaches to product defects will vary. A product may be recalled in one country but not in others. However, within the European Union, competent authorities are required without delay to take corrective action against a device (including withdrawal/recall of a device) and notify other national competent authorities, the European Commission and notified bodies (as applicable) of any devices that present an unacceptable risk to the health or safety of patients, users or other persons, or other aspects of the protection of public health. Other non-compliance with the MDR may also lead to corrective action being taken and notifications being sent if the non-compliance is not rectified within a given time period (as determined by the competent authority). Therefore a recall in one EU member state may lead to recalls in the rest of the European Union.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain regulatory qualifications outside the United States, which could harm our business.\nSales of the OCS outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. The foreign regulatory approval process generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA clearance or approval in addition to other risks. Complying with international regulatory requirements can be an expensive and time-consuming process, and approval is not certain. The time required to obtain foreign clearances or approvals may exceed the time required for FDA clearance or approval, and requirements for such clearances or approvals may differ significantly from FDA requirements. Foreign regulatory authorities may not clear or approve our product for the same uses cleared or approved by the FDA. Although we have been able to affix the CE Mark to the OCS Lung, OCS Heart and OCS Liver in the European Union, we may not be able to maintain such CE Marking, including as a result of the need to re-certify our products, under the new Medical Devices Regulation and the Medical Devices Regulations 2002\u202f(UK MDR 2002) in Great Britain. Our notified body in the Netherlands, BSI, could determine either itself or at the request of a competent authority that our OCS products do not meet the regulatory requirements for CE marking, which would result in withdrawal of the certificates that allow the CE marking required to market the OCS products in the European Union. In addition, we may not be able to affix the CE Mark to new or modified products and we may fail to obtain any additional regulatory qualifications, clearances or approvals or to comply with additional legal obligations required by the individual member states of the European Union or other countries in which we seek to market the OCS. The FDA also regulates the export of medical devices from the United States. If we are not successful in obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or complying with U.S. export regulations, our business will be harmed.\nForeign regulatory agencies periodically inspect manufacturing facilities both in the United States and abroad. While we implement corrective and preventive action related to any inspection observations, we may fail to pass future inspections of our facility by applicable regulatory authorities or entities both in the United States and in other countries. Delays in receiving necessary qualifications, clearances or approvals to market our product outside the United States, or the failure to receive those qualifications, clearances or approvals, or to comply with other foreign regulatory requirements, could limit or prevent us from marketing our products or enhancements in international markets. Additionally, the imposition of new requirements could significantly affect our business and our product, and we might not be able to adjust to such new requirements. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe could face product liability suits or regulatory delays due to defects in the OCS, which could be expensive and time-consuming and result in substantial damages payable by us and increases in our insurance rates.\nIf our products are deemed to be defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contain defective components, suffer security failures or are hacked, or are counterfeited, we could face substantial and costly litigation by transplant centers that purchase or use the OCS or by their patients or others claiming damages on their behalf. Moreover, transplantations are complex and inherently risky medical procedures. Many of the patients currently on a waiting list for a lung, heart or liver transplant already are very sick, with some of them receiving intensive care. All of these patients have a significant risk of death if they do not receive a transplant. Thus, we may incur substantial liability if the OCS fails to perform as expected and, as a result of this failure, patients do not receive the intended transplants or receive transplants that are not successful. Although death is an anticipated adverse event of the organ transplant population, if the rate of deaths or other serious adverse events using the OCS is greater than expected using conventional transplant procedures, transplant surgeons may cease using the OCS as often or at all, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\nBecause the OCS represents a novel approach to organ transplantation, a patient or transplant center may choose to name us as a party to a lawsuit relating to the use of the OCS in connection with a planned or completed transplant procedure regardless of whether the OCS caused or contributed to a serious adverse event or death of a patient. Any claim, whether or not we are ultimately successful, could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizable damage awards against us.\nCurrently, we maintain global product liability insurance covering damages of up to $10 million per occurrence for both the human clinical and commercial use of our product. We also maintain local insurance policies as required. Our current insurance coverage might not be sufficient to cover future claims and is subject to deductibles. Moreover, in the future, we may not be able to obtain insurance in amount or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Any product liability claims brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage, could harm our reputation in the industry, impair our current or future preclinical studies or clinical trials, hinder acceptance of our products in the market and reduce product sales. Furthermore, we would need to pay any product liability losses in excess of our insurance coverage or within the deductibles provided under our insurance policies applicable to the claim out of cash reserves, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\nThe FDA has warned that the threat of cyberattacks on medical devices is no longer theoretical. Hackers and other third parties may try to circumvent security controls on an OCS to gain access to information on the OCS, alter the way an OCS operates, to act as a trojan horse or other entry point to other systems that could lead to those systems suffering cybersecurity breaches or attacks, or to cause harms to transplanted organs or individuals. If our security controls fail to fully protect the OCS and the information on it, we could suffer reputational harm, could undergo regulatory investigations and enforcement, or could have claims brought against us.\nThird parties may attempt to produce counterfeit versions of our products, which may harm our ability to sell the OCS and its components, negatively affect our reputation or harm patients and subject us to product liability.\nCounterfeit medical devices are an increasing presence on the market. Third parties may seek to develop, manufacture, distribute and sell systems that we believe infringe our proprietary rights, which would compete against the OCS and impair our ability to sell the OCS in jurisdictions in which our proprietary rights are not upheld. In addition, counterfeit products may be promoted in a way that misleads consumers into believing they are affiliated with us. If a counterfeit version of the OCS were to appear on the market, we would expect to be obliged to verify all OCS products currently on the market, and possibly to withdraw all OCS products from the market while verifications are made. We also might be named in a lawsuit relating to any side effects or fatalities allegedly related to the use of a counterfeit OCS irrespective of whether the counterfeit device in fact contributed to such an adverse event or whether we were aware of the existence of the counterfeit device.\nImproper marketing or promotion of our products or misuse or off-label use of the OCS may harm our reputation in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability suits or result in costly investigations, fines or sanctions by regulatory bodies if we are deemed to have engaged in the promotion of these uses, any of which could be costly to our business.\nOur OCS products have been approved for marketing in the United States, European Union and other jurisdictions for specific indications, and our promotional materials and training methods must comply with regulatory requirements in the countries where they are sold. We train our commercial team to not promote the OCS for uses outside of the approved indications for use/intended purpose, known as \u201coff-label uses.\u201d We cannot, however, prevent a surgeon from using the OCS off-label, when in the surgeon\u2019s independent professional medical judgment he or she deems it appropriate. There may be increased risk of injury to patients if surgeons attempt to use the OCS off-label. Furthermore, the use of the OCS for indications other than those approved by the FDA/ by any foreign regulatory body or for which they are CE marked may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among surgeons and patients.\nIf the FDA or any foreign regulatory body determines that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of an off-label use, or that the materials or training are false or misleading, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance or imposition of an untitled letter, which is used for violations that do not necessitate a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. In the EU the MDR expressly prohibits misleading claims in the form of off-label promotion and the MDR grants enforcement powers to national competent authorities. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action under other regulatory authority, such as false claims laws or consumer protection laws, if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties,\nincluding, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations.\nIn addition, surgeons may misuse the OCS or use improper techniques if they are not adequately trained, potentially leading to unsatisfactory patient outcomes, patient injuries, negative publicity and an increased risk of product liability. If the OCS is misused or used with improper technique, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients. Similarly, in an effort to decrease costs, surgeons may also reuse the component and accessories of the OCS that are intended for a single use or may purchase reprocessed OCS components from third-party reprocessors in lieu of purchasing new components from us, which could result in product failure and liability. As described above, product liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizeable damage awards against us that may not be covered by insurance.\nLegislative or regulatory reforms in the United States or other jurisdictions may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our products or to manufacture, market or distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in the U.S. Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulation of medical devices. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance may be revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new statutes, regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any future products or make it more difficult to obtain approval for, manufacture, market or distribute our products. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require additional testing prior to obtaining clearance or approval; changes to manufacturing methods; recall, replacement or discontinuance of our products; or additional record keeping.\nIn the EU, Regulation (EU) 2017/745, or the MDR, which repealed and replaced the Medical Devices Directive (93/42/EEC) with effect from May, 26 2021. Although the MDR now applies so all new devices placed on the market must be CE marked under it, under the transition period granted by the MDR, certificates issued by notified bodies for medical devices under the Medical Devices Directive before May 26, 2021 remain valid until the period indicated on the certificate, subject to all certificates becoming void on May 27, 2024. Post-Brexit the MDR applies in Northern Ireland in accordance with the Northern Irish Protocol but does not apply in Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland). The UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 provided a transitional period under which the UK will recognize EU CE marks until June 30, 2023. To be placed on the market in Great Britain after this date, medical devices must have undergone a conformity assessment in accordance with the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 and have the UKCA mark affixed.\nWe recognize that our products will have to be re-certified under the MDR by September 2022 (as they currently benefit from the MDR transition period) and we are actively working with our notified body to meet the MDR requirements.\nHowever, if we do not manage to re-certify our products under this regulation or can no longer rely on the transitional provisions (e.g., if a substantial change is made to the design or intended purpose), we may have to take our products off the EU market until this is the case.\nWe also recognize that our products will need to be certified and have a UKCA mark affixed to be placed on the market in Great Britain from July 1, 2023. However, in 2021 the MHRA ran a consultation on the future regulation of medical devices in the UK. This might lead to substantial changes in the regulatory framework/requirements imposed on medical devices. This could slow our ability to obtain the necessary certification and we may have to take our product off the market in Great Britain until we could obtain a UKCA mark.\nWe are subject to certain federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws, health information privacy and security laws and transparency laws, which, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties. Additionally, any challenge to or investigation into our practices under these laws could cause adverse publicity and be costly.\nThere are numerous U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign, laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, false claims and physician transparency laws. Our business practices and relationships with providers are subject to scrutiny under these laws. We may also be subject to privacy and security regulation related to patient, customer, employee and other third-party information by both the federal government and the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual or furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. The U.S. government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in substantial civil monetary and criminal penalties. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nthe federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent. These laws can apply to manufacturers who provide information on coverage, coding, and reimbursement of their products to persons who bill private payors. Private individuals can bring False Claims Act \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose substantial civil fines and penalties, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nthe federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Sunshine Act under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act, which require certain applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. Applicable manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to CMS. Failure to submit required information may result in substantial civil monetary penalties;\n\u2022\nmany countries in which we operate have laws with extra-territorial effect-those laws apply to our operations outside the relevant country, to the extent they are breached. Examples of such laws include: the FCPA, Bribery Act and the GDPR. The extra-territorial effect of those laws affects our sales and marketing strategy, since in many countries healthcare professionals are officers of the state. This is particularly important in the context of bribery offences, which in the UK and in the United States include the offence of bribing a foreign public official. Failure by our sales staff to comply with those laws may result in criminal and civil penalties and damage our reputation; and\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any private payor, including commercial insurers or patients; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm customers, foreign and state laws, including the GDPR, governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; and state laws related to insurance fraud in the case of claims involving private insurers.\nThese laws and regulations, among other things, constrain our business, marketing and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with customers, physicians or other potential purchasers of our products. In particular, these laws will influence, among other things, how we structure our sales offerings, including discount and rebate practices, customer support, education and training programs, and physician consulting and other service arrangements. Due to the breadth of these laws, the narrowness of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, and the range of interpretations to which they are subject, it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws.\nTo enforce compliance with the healthcare regulatory laws, certain enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. For example, the member states of the European Union closely monitor perceived unlawful marketing activity by companies, including inducement to prescribe and the encouragement of off-label use of devices. Responding to investigations can be time-and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Additionally, as a result of these investigations, healthcare providers and entities may have to agree to additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the healthcare laws or regulations described above or any other healthcare regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, disgorgement and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Moreover, industry associations closely monitor the activities of their member companies. If these organizations or national authorities were to name us as having breached our obligations under their laws, regulations, rules or standards, our reputation would suffer and our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects could be adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws, including the FCPA, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations could result in civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses.\nAs we grow our international presence, we are increasingly exposed to trade and economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the United States, the European Union and other governments and organizations. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State and U.S. Treasury and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export control laws, the FCPA and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. In addition, the Bribery Act prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. The substantive offences of offering or receiving a bribe will be committed by an individual where either the bribery takes place in the U.K, or the person paying or receiving the bribe has a close connection with the UK An organization which is either incorporated in or carries on part of its business in the U.K will be liable under the Bribery Act if a person associated with the organization (being persons performing services for it) pays a bribe anywhere in the world intending to obtain or retain business for the organization. This is a strict liability offense with the only defenses available being that the organization implemented \u201cadequate procedures\u201d to prevent bribery or it was reasonable for it to not have such procedures in place. Under these laws and regulations, as well as other anti-corruption laws, anti-money laundering laws, export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations, various government agencies may require export licenses, may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities and modifications to compliance\nprograms, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions. A violation of these laws or regulations would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Due to sales of our products to government or government-affiliated entities, we may be exposed to heightened risk of potential violations of the FCPA, the Bribery Act, or other relevant law.\nWe have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance by us and our directors, officers, employees, representatives, consultants and agents with the FCPA, OFAC restrictions, the Bribery Act and other export control, anti-corruption, anti-money-laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations. We cannot assure you, however, that our policies and procedures are or will be sufficient or that directors, officers, employees, representatives, consultants and agents have not engaged and will not engage in conduct for which we may be held responsible, nor can we assure you that our business partners have not engaged and will not engage in conduct that could materially affect their ability to perform their contractual obligations to us or even result in our being held liable for such conduct. Violations of the FCPA, OFAC restrictions, the Bribery Act or other export control, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws or regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to, and may in the future become subject to additional, U.S., state and foreign laws and regulations imposing obligations on how we collect, store, process or share information concerning individuals. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business. Complying with such laws could also impair our efforts to maintain and expand our customer base, and thereby decrease our revenue.\nIn the conduct of our business, we may at times collect, process or share data concerning individuals, including health-related personal data. The U.S. federal government and various states have adopted or proposed laws, regulations, guidelines and rules for the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information of individuals. We may also be subject to U.S. federal rules, regulations and guidance concerning cybersecurity for medical devices, including guidance from the FDA. State privacy and cybersecurity laws vary and, in some cases, can impose more restrictive requirements than U.S. federal law. For example, the CCPA affords California residents expanded privacy rights and protections, including civil penalties for violations and statutory damages under a private right of action for data security breaches. These protections will be expanded by CPRA, which will be operational in most key respects on January 1, 2023. Similar legislative proposals have passed or are being advanced in other states. Where state laws are more protective, we must comply with the stricter provisions. In addition to fines and penalties that may be imposed for failure to comply with state law, some states also provide for private rights of action to individuals for misuse of personal information. Our ongoing efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations may be costly and require ongoing modifications to our policies, procedures and systems. Failure to comply with laws regarding data protection would expose us to risk of enforcement actions and penalties under such laws. Even if we are not determined to have violated applicable data laws, government investigations into these issues can be expensive and lengthy and generate adverse publicity, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nThe EEA and the UK, as well as other international jurisdictions, also have laws and regulations dealing with the collection, use and processing of personal data concerning individuals who are located there. Those laws are often more restrictive than those in the United States. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the GDPR, which imposes more stringent administrative requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example, shortened timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data, additional obligations when we contract with service providers, and more robust rights for individuals over their personal data. The GDPR provides that EU member states may make their own further laws and regulations, including laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or cause our costs to increase, and harm our business and financial condition. If we do not comply with our obligations under the GDPR, we could be exposed to enforcement activity from EU regulators, including substantial fines and litigation. In addition, EU law restricts transfers of personal data to the United States unless certain requirements are met. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. For example, in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield Framework, which has led to increased scrutiny of data transfers from the EEA and the UK to the United States generally and may increase our costs of compliance with data privacy legislation. We rely on a mixture of mechanisms to transfer personal data from our European business to the United States. We are also subject to the laws of each EU member state implementing any EU directive applicable to our processing activities, including Directing 2002/58/EC.\nWe are subject to the requirements of the UK Data Protection Law as amended and superseded from time to time. UK Data Protection Law means: (i) the GDPR as it forms part of UK law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018; (ii) the Data Protection Act 2018; (iii) the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 as they continue to have effect by virtue of section 2 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018; and (iv) any other laws in the field of data protection in force in the UK from time to time applicable (in whole or in part) to us.\nAny actual or perceived failure by us or the third parties with whom we work to comply with data privacy or security laws, policies, legal obligations or industry standards, or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of information concerning individuals, may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations, including by European data protection authorities and U.S. federal and state regulatory authorities, fines and penalties, litigation and/or adverse publicity, including by consumer advocacy groups, and could cause our customers, their patients and other healthcare professionals to lose trust in us, which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHealthcare policy changes, including recently enacted or potential future legislation reforming the U.S. healthcare system, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly-regulated industry. The U.S. and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation or take administrative action that may affect the availability and cost of healthcare. Healthcare reform initiatives could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, the Affordable Care Act, which was enacted in 2010, substantially revised the coverage, delivery and payment of health care services. For example, the Affordable Care Act:\n\u2022\nestablished a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research;\n\u2022\nimplemented payment system reforms, including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models; and\n\u2022\nexpanded health care coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the so-called \u201cindividual mandate\u201d for health insurance coverage.\nSince its enactment, there have been and likely will be judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminates the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019 (the so-called \u201cindividual mandate\u201d). More recently, on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the latest judicial challenge to the Affordable Care Act brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. Changes resulting from any successful challenges or other future modifications have a material impact on our business.\nBeyond the Affordable Care Act, there have been and will likely continue to be ongoing healthcare reform efforts. These reform efforts have and may continue to focus on coverage and payment for organ procurement and transplant. For example, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued regulations in 2020 and 2021 that revised Medicare conditions of participation for organ procurement organizations as well as organ acquisition payment policies for organ procurement organizations, transplant centers and donor hospitals.\nWe expect additional state and federal healthcare policies and reform measures to be adopted in the future, any of which could limit coverage or reimbursement for healthcare products and services or otherwise result in reduced demand for the OCS or additional pricing pressure and have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our customers. Any changes of, or uncertainty with respect to, coverage or reimbursement of services provided by organ procurement organizations, transplant centers or hospitals could affect demand for the OCS, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, other broader legislative changes have been adopted that could have an adverse effect upon, and could prevent, our products\u2019 commercial success. The Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, or the Budget Control Act, includes provisions intended to reduce the federal deficit, including reductions in Medicare payments to providers through\n2030 (except May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022). Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid, or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs, or any significant taxes or fees imposed as part of any broader deficit reduction effort or legislative replacement to the Budget Control Act, or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our anticipated product revenue.\nOur business activities involve the use of hazardous materials, which require compliance with environmental and occupational safety laws regulating the use of such materials. If we violate these laws, we could be subject to significant fines, liabilities or other adverse consequences.\nOur research and development programs involve the controlled use of hazardous materials. Accordingly, we are subject to international, federal, state and local laws governing the use, handling and disposal of these materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply in all material respects with applicable regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of an accident or failure to comply with environmental laws, we could be held liable for damages that result, and any such liability could exceed our assets and resources. Our general liability and umbrella insurance policies provide for coverage up to annual aggregate limits of $2 million per occurrence but exclude coverage for liabilities relating to the release of pollutants. The insurance that we currently hold may not be adequate to cover all liabilities relating to accidental contamination or injury due to pollution conditions or other extraordinary or unanticipated events. Furthermore, an accident could damage or force us to shut down our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and General Risks\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and could subject us to securities class action litigation.\nOver the last twelve months, the price per share of our common stock has ranged from as low as $17.20 to as high as $49.50. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the market price and trading volume of comparable companies;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our earnings or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of securities analysts;\n\u2022\nresults of post-approval studies or clinical trials relating to next generation products for the OCS or competing products;\n\u2022\nfailure or discontinuation of any of our product development and research programs;\n\u2022\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries, including changes in the healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nresults or changes in the status of, or developments relating to, applications for regulatory approvals or clearances for the OCS or competing products;\n\u2022\nour announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements of new products, procedures or therapies;\n\u2022\ndeparture of key personnel;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving us or that may be perceived as having an adverse effect on our business;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the medical device and biotechnology sectors;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic, industry and market conditions and trends;\n\u2022\ninvestors\u2019 general perception of us; and\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our stock.\nThe market for medical device and biotechnology companies, in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the companies whose stock is experiencing those price and volume fluctuations. Because of the potential volatility of our stock price, we may become the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nAn active trading market may not be sustained.\nYou may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at a recently reported market price if trading in our common stock does not remain active. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of your shares. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration.\nIf securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our business or do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model or our stock performance, or if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of the investor community, one or more of the analysts who cover our company may change their recommendations regarding our company, and our stock price could decline.\nWe have adopted anti-takeover provisions in our restated articles of organization and amended and restated bylaws and are subject to provisions of Massachusetts law that may frustrate any attempt to remove or replace our current board of directors or to effect a change of control or other business combination involving our company.\nOur restated articles or organization and amended and restated bylaws and certain provisions of Massachusetts law may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control of our company that might be beneficial to us or our security holders. For example, our amended and restated bylaws grant the chairperson presiding over any meetings of shareholders the right to adjourn such meeting. Our board of directors also may issue shares of any class or series of preferred stock in the future without shareholder approval and upon such terms as our board of directors may determine. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be harmed by, the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. Massachusetts state law also prohibits us from engaging in specified business combinations unless the combination is approved or consummated in a prescribed manner. These provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of our company or changes in our management.\nOur restated articles of organization designate the Business Litigation Session of the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts (or, if and only if the Business Litigation Session of the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts lacks jurisdiction, another state or federal court located within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts) as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\nOur restated articles of organization designate the Business Litigation Session of the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts (or, if and only if the Business Litigation Session of the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts lacks jurisdiction, another state or federal court located within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts) as the sole and exclusive forum for any action under Massachusetts statutory or common law: brought derivatively on our behalf, asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our shareholders, asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act or asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases subject to the court\u2019s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. In addition, our restated articles of organization provide that any person or entity purchasing or\notherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. This provision will not apply to actions arising under the Exchange Act, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Additionally, this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if the Business Litigation Session of the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts or a court outside of Massachusetts were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other venues or jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner or prevent fraud, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, our management is required to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weakness identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports, and we are required to disclose significant changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis.\nIf we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to remediate the material weakness identified in a timely manner or maintain all of the controls necessary to remain in compliance with our reporting obligations. If we identify any material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting or we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in future periods, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. As a result, the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAccounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, leases and stock-based compensation, are complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in accounting pronouncements or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.", "PERMNO": 18676, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "TMDX"}
