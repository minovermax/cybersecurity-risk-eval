Although the Company engages in commodity hedging transactions and annual supply agreements as well as leveraging the high volume of its annual purchases, the Company may experience price increases in these ingredients that it may not be able to offset, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, although the Company has historically been able to procure sufficient supplies of its ingredients, market conditions could change such that adequate supplies might not be available or only become available at substantially higher costs. Adverse weather patterns, including the effects of climate change, can significantly affect the cost and availability of these ingredients.\n\u00b7\nRisk of changes in product performance and competition - The Company competes with other well-established manufacturers of confectionery products. A failure of new or existing products to be favorably received, a failure to retain preferred shelf space at retail or a failure to sufficiently counter aggressive competitive actions could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\u00b7\nRisk of discounting and other competitive actions - Discounting and pricing pressure by the Company\u2019s retail customers and other competitive actions could make it more difficult for the Company to maintain its operating margins.\n\u00b7\nRisk of dependence on large customers - The Company\u2019s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 23.7% of net product sales in 2014, and other large national chains are also material to the Company\u2019s sales. The loss of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or one or more other large customers, or a material decrease in purchases by one or more large customers, could result in decreased sales and adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\u00b7\nRisk of changes in consumer preferences and tastes - Failure to adequately anticipate and react to changing demographics, consumer trends, consumer health concerns and product preferences could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\u00b7\nRisk of economic conditions on consumer purchases - The Company\u2019s sales are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence, employment levels, disposable income, availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit, consumer debt levels, energy costs and other factors. Volatility in food and energy costs, rising unemployment and/or underemployment, declines in personal spending, and recessionary economic conditions could adversely impact the Company\u2019s revenues, profitability and financial condition.\n\u00b7\nRisks related to environmental matters - The Company\u2019s operations are not particularly impactful on the environment, but increased government environmental regulation or legislation could adversely impact the Company\u2019s profitability.\nRisks relating to participation in the multi-employer pension plan for certain Company union employees - As outlined in Note 7 (page 22) to the consolidated financial statements and discussed in the Management\u2019s Discussion & Analysis (page 6), the Company participates in a multi-employer pension plan (Plan) which is currently in critical status, the \u201cRed Zone\u201d, as defined by applicable law. Under terms of a rehabilitation plan, the Company is to be assessed 5% annual compounded surcharges on its contributions to the Plan until such time as the Plan emerges from critical status. Should the Company withdraw from the Plan, it would subject to a withdrawal liability which is discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently unable to determine the ultimate outcome of this matter and therefore, is unable to determine the effects on its consolidated financial statements, but, the ultimate outcome could be material to its consolidated results of operations in one or more future periods.\n\u00b7\nRisk of new governmental laws and regulations - Governmental laws and regulations, including those that affect food advertising and marketing, including products for children, use of ingredients in products, including the use of hydrogenated oils, income and other taxes and tariffs, including those targeted toward confectionery products, and the environment, both in and outside the U.S., are subject to change over time, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and ability to compete in domestic or foreign marketplaces.\n\u00b7\nRisk of labor stoppages - To the extent the Company experiences any significant labor stoppages, such disputes or strikes could negatively affect shipments from suppliers or shipments of finished product.\n\u00b7\nRisk of impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets - In accordance with authoritative guidance, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to an impairment evaluation annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of a triggering event, and other long-lived assets are likewise tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event.\n\u00b7\nRisk of the cost of energy increasing - Higher energy costs would likely result in higher distribution, freight and other operating costs. The Company may not be able to offset these cost increases or pass such cost increases onto customers in the form of price increases, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\u00b7\nRisk of a product recall - Issues related to the quality and safety of the Company\u2019s products could result in a voluntary or involuntary large-scale product recall. Negative publicity associated with this type of situation, including a product recall relating to product contamination or product tampering, whether valid or not, could negatively impact demand for our products. Costs associated with these potential actions, including a product recall and related litigation or fines, and marketing costs relating to the re-launch of such products or brands, could negatively affect operating results.\n\u00b7\nRisk of operational interruptions relating to computer software or hardware failures - The Company is reliant on computer systems to operate its business. Software failure or corruption, including cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, or catastrophic hardware failures or disaster could disrupt supply chain planning and activities relating to sales demand forecasts, materials procurement, production planning, customer shipments, and financial and accounting, all of which could negatively impact sales and profits.\n\u00b7\nRisk of production interruptions - The majority of the Company\u2019s products are manufactured in a single production facility on specialized equipment. In the event of a disaster, such as a fire or earthquake, at a specific plant location, it would be difficult to transfer production to other facilities or a new location in a timely manner, which could result in loss of market share for the affected products.\n\u00b7\nRisk related to international operations - To the extent there is political or social unrest, civil war, terrorism or significant economic instability in the countries in which the Company operates, the results of the Company\u2019s business in such countries could be adversely impacted. Currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could also have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s principal markets are the U.S.A., Canada, and Mexico.\n\u00b7\nRisk related to investments in marketable securities and equity method investments - The Company invests its surplus cash in a diversified portfolio of highly rated marketable securities, including tax exempt municipal bonds, with maturities of generally up to three years. Nonetheless, such investments could become impaired in the event of certain adverse economic and/or geopolitical events.\n\u00b7\nDisruption to our supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver our finished products, resulting in a negative impact on our operating results - Disruption to our manufacturing operations or our supply chain, some of which are discussed above, could result from, but are not limited to natural disasters, pandemic outbreak of disease, weather, fire or explosion, terrorism or other acts of violence, unavailability of ingredients or packaging materials, labor strikes or other labor activities, operational and/or financial instability of key suppliers, and other vendors or service providers. Although we take precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions, if we are unable, or if it is not financially feasible, to effectively mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such disruptive events, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is a controlled company due to the common stock holdings of the Gordon family - The Gordon family\u2019s share ownership represents a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of the Company\u2019s common stock as of December 31, 2014. As a result, the Gordon family has the power to elect the Company\u2019s directors and approve actions requiring the approval of the shareholders of the Company.\nThe factors identified above are believed to be significant factors, but not necessarily all of the significant factors, that could impact our business. Unpredictable or unknown factors could also have material effects on the Company.\nAdditional significant factors that may affect the Company\u2019s operations, performance and business results include the risks and uncertainties listed from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the risk factors or uncertainties listed herein or listed in any document incorporated by reference herein.\nSee also the subsection entitled \"Risk Factors\" in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" on Pages 11 and 12 of the 2014 Report (Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K), which subsection is incorporated herein by reference.", "PERMNO": 14816, "SIC": 2060, "TIC": "TR"}
