Risk Factors\nWe are affected by risks specific to us as well as factors that affect all businesses operating in a global market. The significant factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results are set forth below.\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses in the previous eight years and negative cash flow from operations in five of the previous eight years. We currently have a working capital deficiency of $10.5 million, which is inclusive of current deferred revenue of $15.2 million, and a stockholders' deficit of $21.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred a net loss of $11.0 million and negative cash flow from operations of $9.4 million. Our total cash balance at December 31, 2016 is $3.4 million, a decrease of $10.0 million as compared to December 31, 2015. In addition to these financial metrics, as of December 31, 2016, we were not in compliance with the financial covenants of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock, which are mutually agreed to annually, for two consecutive quarters. This breach provides the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stockholders with the right to require us to redeem any of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock at the greater of 100% of the stated value plus accrued and unpaid dividends or the product of the number of shares of common stock underlying the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock and the closing price of our common stock as of December 31, 2016. To date, the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock have neither exercised nor waived this right and accordingly this right may be exercised at any time. In addition, the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock have the right to request a redemption of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock on or after August 5, 2017. If the holders request that the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock be redeemed, we may not have sufficient liquidity to undertake the redemption. If we do not redeem the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock, the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock can pursue other remedies. Refer to Note (8) Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding these other remedies. Our reduced cash balance and history of losses both in and of itself, and in combination with the redemption rights of the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after March 10, 2017 (the date that these financial statements were issued). Accordingly, the financial statements as of December 31, 2016, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern for the next twelve months.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern, including in the event of a redemption request by the holder, depends on our ability to execute our business plan, increase revenue and billings and reduce expenditures. During 2016, we continued to focus on aligning our expense structure with revenue expectations which included tighter expense controls and overall operational efficiencies which better align our current business plan on a run-rate basis. These efficiencies include among other items, stream-lined personnel related costs and global overhead costs and efficiencies realized on our redesigned go-to-market coverage models. We have reduced our worldwide headcount to 166 employees as of December 31, 2016, compared with 226 employees as of December 31, 2015. However, the decline in revenue over the last twelve months combined with the separation costs related to the headcount reductions have reduced the impact of these reductions in operating expenses, thereby not achieving the expected reduction of quarterly cash burn rate.\nThere is no assurance that we will be successful in generating sufficient revenue or continuing to reduce operating costs. In addition, to the extent that we continue to incur losses, we may need to seek additional financing and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing or that such financing will be on favorable terms. Any such financing could be dilutive to our shareholders. Failure to generate sufficient revenue, billings, control or reduce expenditures and/or the inability to obtain financing will result in an inability of us to continue as a going concern.\nWe defaulted under a covenant in the Stock Purchase Agreement covering our Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we were not in compliance with the financial covenants related to our Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock because we did not reach the agreed upon targets for two consecutive quarters. Under the agreement, this default would allow the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stockholders to require us to redeem any of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock for the greater of 100% of the stated value plus accrued and unpaid dividends or the product of the number of shares of common stock underlying the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock and the closing price as of December 31, 2016. As a result, the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock has the right to demand redemption of any of the outstanding Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock they hold. To date, the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock have neither exercised nor waived this right and accordingly this right may be exercised at any time. If we do not have the funds necessary to redeem the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock, the dividends accruing on any outstanding Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock will increase to prime plus 10% (from prime plus 5%). For each six months that the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock remains unredeemed, the dividend rate increases by 1%, subject to a maximum dividend rate of 19%. Paying these increased dividends could further decrease the amount of capital we have available to run and to invest in our business. In addition, our failure to redeem the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock would be considered a \u201cBreach Event\u201d under the agreements with the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock. If a Breach Event were to occur, then, under the agreements with the holders of our Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock, our Board of Directors would automatically be increased, with the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock having the right to appoint the new directors, so that the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock would have appointed a majority of the Board of Directors. This would give the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock control of the Company. There can be no assurance that we will be able to redeem the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock should the holders of our Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock request such redemption.\nThe holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock have the right to require redemption of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock after August 5, 2017. If we are not able to redeem the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock following a redemption request, the dividends on the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock will increase. These increased dividends could further reduce the amount of capital available for use in our business. In addition, if we are not able to redeem the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock then the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock will be entitled to appoint a majority of our Board of Directors, which will give the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock control of the Company. There can be no assurance that we will be able to redeem the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock after August 5, 2017.\nAfter August 5, 2017, the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock have the right to demand redemption of any of the outstanding Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock that they still hold. If we do not have the funds necessary to redeem the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock, the dividends accruing on any outstanding Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock will increase to prime plus 10% (from prime plus 5%). For each six months that the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock remains unredeemed, the dividend rate increases by 1%, subject to a maximum dividend rate of 19%. Paying these increased dividends could further decrease the amount of capital we have available to run and to invest in our business. In addition, our failure to redeem the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock would be considered a \u201cBreach Event\u201d under the agreements with the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock. If a Breach Event were to occur, then, under the agreements with the holders of our Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock, our Board of Directors would automatically be increased, with the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock having the right to appoint the new directors, so that the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock would have appointed a majority of the Board of Directors. This would give the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock control of the Company. There can be no assurance that we will be able to redeem the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock after August 5, 2017 should the holders of our Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock request such redemption.\nWe have had a history of losses since 2009. There is no guarantee that we will be able to return to, or to maintain, profitability.\nWe have had a history of losses since 2009. We have taken steps to try to reduce or to eliminate the chance of future losses - such as reducing headcount and other expenses and trying to replace lost OEM sales with sales of FalconStor-branded products - but there is no guarantee that we will be able to return to or to maintain profitability. In addition, our future profitability could be negatively impacted by the decrease of bookings to $30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared with $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $3.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. If losses recur, we will deplete our available cash and we may not be able to continue to fund effective sales and marketing or research and development activities on which we are dependent. In addition, to the extent that we continue to incur losses, we may need to seek additional financing and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing or that such financing will be on favorable terms. Furthermore, to the extent that we issue equity securities in a financing it could be dilutive to our stockholders.\nWe have received delisting notices from NASDAQ and if our stock price continues to trade below $1.00 per share or the market value of our common stock continues to be below $35 million, our common stock will be delisted from NASDAQ.\nThe NASDAQ Capital Market requires that our common stock maintain a bid price of at least $1.00 per share. As of November 22, 2016, the closing price of our common stock had been below $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days and the Company received written notification from the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC indicating that the Company is not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), as the Company's closing bid price for its common stock was below the $1.00 per share requirement for the previous 30 consecutive business days. Compliance can be achieved by meeting the applicable standard for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days during the 180 day compliance period ending May 22, 2017, of which there can be no assurance. In addition, because we have a stockholder deficit, the NASDAQ Capital Market requires the market value of our common stock to be at least $35 million. As of December 6, 2016, the market value of our common stock had been below $35 million for 30 consecutive trading days and the Company received written notification from the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC indicating that the Company is not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(2), as the Company's market value of listed securities was below $35 million for the previous 30 consecutive business days. Compliance can be achieved by meeting the applicable standard for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days during the 180 compliance period ending June 5, 2017, of which there can be no assurance. If our common stock is delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market, the liquidity of our common stock could be materially impacted and it may be more difficult to make transactions in our common stock.\nWe recently released our new FreeStor platform and our latest version of CDP/NSS. Our future business, financial and operating results are substantially dependent on the market acceptance of both of these products.\nOn May 6, 2015 we released our new FreeStor platform, with subsequent enhancements delivered in April and October of 2016 and on November 30, 2016, we released the latest version of our CDP/NSS product, CDP/NSS 9.0. We have spent considerable resources, both financially and in our research and development efforts, developing CDP/NSS 9.0 and FreeStor. In addition, while bookings for FreeStor during the year ended December 31, 2016 exceeded the bookings for this product for the year ended December 31, 2015, the bookings associated with our FreeStor platform failed to make up for declines in our traditional product lines. We currently do not have any other products in our pipeline with the same expectations or which we believe have the same potential for market acceptance as CDP/NSS 9.0 and FreeStor. If (i) either CDP/NSS 9.0 or FreeStor do not gain market acceptance, (ii) sales of either CDP/NSS 9.0 or FreeStor are significantly below our expectations, or (iii) the ongoing future feature/functionality sets of both products are delayed, our results may suffer and it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have a significant number of outstanding preferred stock and options, the conversion and exercise of which would dilute the then-existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership of our common stock, and a smaller number of restricted shares of stock, the vesting of which will also dilute the then-existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding options to purchase 3,491,490 shares of our common stock, we had an aggregate of 2,136,800 outstanding unvested restricted shares and outstanding Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock convertible into 8,781,516 shares of our common stock. If all of the outstanding options were exercised, the proceeds to the Company would average $3.18 per share. In addition, over the next several years a significant number of shares of common stock are potentially issuable as dividends with respect to the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock (including 435,438 share of common stock reserved for issuance related to the accrued dividend as of December 31, 2016.). We also had 2,159,170 shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our stock plans with respect to options (or restricted stock or restricted stock units) that have not been granted. In addition, if, on July 1st of any calendar year in which our 2016 Incentive Stock Plan, (the \u201c2016 Plan\u201d), is in effect, the number of shares of stock to which options, restricted shares and restricted stock units may be granted is less than five percent (5%) of the number of outstanding shares of stock, then the number of shares of stock available for issuance under the 2016 Plan shall be increased so that the number equals five percent (5%) of the shares of common stock outstanding. In no event shall the number of shares of common stock subject to the 2016 Plan in the aggregate exceed twenty million shares, subject to adjustment as provided in the 2016 Plan.\nThe exercise of all of the outstanding options and/or the vesting of all outstanding restricted shares, the conversion of our outstanding Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock into common stock, the payment of dividends on our Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock through the issuance of common stock and/or the grant and exercise of additional options and/or the grant and vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units would dilute the then-existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership of common stock, and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such exercise could adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common stock. Moreover, the terms upon which we would be able to obtain additional equity capital could be adversely affected because the holders of such securities can be expected to exercise or convert them at a time when we would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable than those provided by such securities.\nWe have undertaken a restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives to reduce our expenses and to better align our expenses with our business. There can be no assurance that we have made enough reductions or the right reductions.\nSince the third quarter of 2013 we have taken several actions to reduce expenses significantly in an attempt to help return the Company to profitability. Among the actions we took were: A reduction in personnel of approximately 60%; closing offices in geographic locations where our expenses have continued to outpace our revenue; and reducing other expenditures. To date, the reduction in expenses has not been sufficient to return the Company to profitability. There can be no guarantee that the reductions we have made are the right reductions for our business going forward. There is a risk that the restructuring, cost cutting initiatives and reduction in personnel will make it more difficult to grow the business and service our customers.\nWe continue to have turnover in our senior management.\nOn September 15, 2016, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer resigned from all his positions in the Company. Daniel Murale was appointed as Vice President and Interim Chief Financial Officer effective September 15, 2016. Mr. Murale served as the Company's Director of Finance from June 2013 until his appointment as Vice President and Interim Chief Financial Officer.\nIn addition to our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer's resignations, in the past few years we have had turnover in other senior positions. We have filled these positions with highly qualified individuals with extensive storage and software company experience. However, there can be no guarantee that the new senior management will be able to get up to speed and successfully manage the Company. In addition, with the exception of Gary Quinn, we have no employment agreements with any of our senior management and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain any or all of the members of the senior management team.\nWe are dependent on a significant customer.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had one customer, Hitachi Data Systems, which accounted for 11% and 10% of our total revenue, respectively. The loss of this customer, or a significant reduction in revenue from this customer, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2015 we had one customer, Violin Memory, Inc., which accounted for 23% of our total revenue. This revenue related to our joint development agreement with Violin Memory, Inc, which was a one-time agreement.\nA significant portion of our receivables is concentrated with three customers.\nAs of December 31, 2016, Datang Telecom International Technology Co., Ltd, Hitachi Data Systems and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd, accounted for 15%, 14% and 12% of our gross accounts receivable balance, respectively. We currently have no reason to expect that these customers will fail to pay the amounts invoiced, nor do we have any history of non-payment with these customers, but the concentration of these receivables means that any failure by these customers to pay us all or a significant portion of these receivables would have a material impact on us.\nDue to the uncertain and shifting development of the data protection and network storage software markets and our reliance on our partners, we may have difficulty accurately predicting revenue for future periods and appropriately budgeting for expenses.\nThe rapidly evolving nature of the data protection and network storage software markets in which we sell our products, the degrees of effort and success of our partners\u2019 sales and marketing efforts, and other factors that are beyond our control, reduce our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly and annual revenue. However, we must use our forecasted revenue to establish our expense budget. Most of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated revenue. As a result, we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any shortfall in revenue.\nIf we are unable to develop and manufacture new products that achieve acceptance in the data protection and the network storage software markets, our operating results may suffer.\nThe data protection and the network storage software markets continue to evolve and as a result there is continuing demand for new products. Accordingly, we may need to develop and manufacture new products that address additional data protection or network storage software market segments and emerging technologies to remain competitive in the data storage software industry. We are uncertain whether we will successfully qualify new data protection or network storage software products with our customers by meeting customer performance and quality specifications. Any failure to address additional market segments could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur products must conform to industry standards in order to be accepted by customers in our markets.\nOur current products are only one part of a storage system. All components of these systems must comply with the same industry standards in order to operate together efficiently. We depend on companies that provide other components of these systems to conform to industry standards. Some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly, and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by OEM customers or end users. If other providers of components do not support the same industry standards as we do, or if competing standards emerge, our products may not achieve market acceptance, which would adversely affect our business.\nOur products handle mission-critical data for our end-customers and are highly technical in nature. If our products have defects, failures occur or end-customer data is lost or corrupted, our reputation and business could be harmed.\nOur products are highly technical and complex and are involved in storing and replicating mission-critical data for our end-customers. Our products may contain undetected defects and failures when they are first introduced or as new versions are released. We have in the past and may in the future discover software errors in new versions of our existing products, new products or product enhancements after their release or introduction, which could result in lost revenue. Despite testing by us and by current and potential end-customers, errors might not be found in new releases or products until after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance. Our products may have security vulnerabilities and be subject to intentional attacks by viruses that seek to take advantage of these bugs, errors or other weaknesses. If defects or failures occur in our products, a number of negative effects in our business could result, including:\n\u2022\nlost revenue or lost end-customers;\n\u2022\nincreased costs, including warranty expense and costs associated with end-customer support;\n\u2022\ndelays, cancellations, reductions or rescheduling of orders or shipments;\n\u2022\nproduct returns or discounts;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management resources;\n\u2022\nlegal claims for breach of contract, product liability, tort or breach of warranty; and\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation and brand.\nBecause our end-customers use our products to manage and protect their data, we could face claims resulting from any loss or corruption of our end-customers\u2019 data due to a product defect. While our sales contracts contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, these provisions might not be upheld. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management\u2019s attention from our business and could result in public perception that our products are not effective, even if the occurrence is unrelated to the use of our products. In addition, our business liability insurance coverage might not be adequate to cover such claims. If any data is lost or corrupted in connection with the use or support of our products, our reputation could be harmed and market acceptance of our products could suffer.\nIssues with the hardware on which our software products are installed could increase our support costs and result in lower sales of our products.\nWe deliver some of our products, both through our resellers and directly to end-users, installed on third party hardware. If the hardware does not function properly, our support costs will go up. We will have to arrange or pay for the repair or replacement of the broken hardware and we may have to increase the size of our support operations. Hardware reliability issues could also cause resellers and end-users to refuse to make purchases from us, even if our software products function properly.\nWe rely on our resellers and our OEM partners for most of our sales.\nThe vast majority of our sales come from sales to end users of our products by our resellers and by our OEM partners. These resellers and OEM partners have limited resources and sales forces and sell many different products, both in the data protection and the network storage software markets and in other markets. The resellers and OEM partners may choose to focus their sales efforts on other products in the data protection and the network storage software markets or other markets. The OEM partners might also choose not to continue to develop or to market products which include our products. This would likely result in lower revenue to us and would impede our ability to grow our business.\nThe failure of our resellers to sell our products effectively could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.\nWe rely significantly on our value-added resellers, direct market resellers, systems integrators and corporate resellers, which we collectively refer to as resellers, for the marketing and distribution of our software products and our services. However, our agreements with resellers are generally not exclusive, are generally renewable annually and in many cases may be terminated by either party without cause. Many of our resellers carry products that are competitive with ours. These resellers may give a higher priority to other products, including those of our competitors, or may not continue to carry our products at all. If a number of resellers were to discontinue or reduce the sales of our products, or were to promote our competitors\u2019 products in lieu of ours, it would have a material adverse effect on our future revenue. Events or occurrences of this nature could seriously harm our sales and results of operations. In addition, we expect that a significant portion of our sales growth will depend upon our ability to identify and attract new reseller partners. The use of resellers is an integral part of our distribution network. We believe that our competitors also use reseller arrangements. Our competitors may be more successful in attracting reseller partners and could enter into exclusive relationships with resellers that make it difficult to expand our reseller network. Any failure on our part to expand our network of resellers could impair our ability to grow revenue in the future.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.\nOur future growth will depend on our ability to enter into successful strategic relationships with third parties. For example, our strategic relationships with DSI, Fujitsu, Hitachi Data Systems, Huawei and X-IO are intended to for the Flash/SSD market targeting customers wanting to integrate new Flash/SSD technology into existing IT environments and OEMs needing to enhance their software stack in order to offer data movement and protection services on their platform. In addition, we work with global distributors to streamline and grow our sales channel. These relationships may not result in additional customers or enable us to generate significant revenue. These relationships are typically non-exclusive and do not prohibit the other party from working with our competitors or from offering competing services. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results could suffer.\nWe rely on channel partners to sell our solutions, and disruptions to, or our failure to develop and manage our channel partners would harm our business.\nOur future success is partially dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with the right channel partners. A majority of our revenue is generated by sales through our channel partners, and we expect channel sales to continue to make up the majority of our total revenue in the future. Accordingly, our revenue is largely dependent on the effective sales and lead generation activities of these channel partners.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technology and product offerings requires significant time and resources. In order to develop and expand our distribution channel, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support our channel, including investment in systems and training. Those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage as we grow our organization. We have no minimum purchase commitments from any of our channel partners, and our contracts with these channel partners do not prohibit them from offering products or services that compete with ours. Our competitors may provide incentives to existing and potential channel partners to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our solutions. Our channel partners may choose not to offer our solutions exclusively or at all. Establishing relationships with channel partners who have a history of selling our competitors\u2019 products may also prove to be difficult. In addition, some of our channel partners are also competitors. Our failure to establish and maintain successful relationships with channel partners would harm our business and operating results.\nWe face intense competition in our market, especially from larger, well-established companies, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.\nA number of very large corporations have historically dominated the data management market. We consider our primary competitors to be companies that provide enterprise storage products, including Dell Inc., Hitachi Data Systems, Hewlett-Packard Company (\u201cHPE\u201d), IBM, CommVault, DataCore and Nexenta. We also compete to a lesser extent with a number of other private companies and certain well-established companies. Some of our competitors have made acquisitions of businesses that allow them to offer more directly competitive and comprehensive solutions than they had previously offered. In addition, the emergence of cloud computing and software-defined-storage may impact both short-term and long-term growth patterns in the markets in which we compete. We expect to encounter new competitors domestically and internationally as other companies enter our market or if we enter new markets.\nMany of our existing competitors have, and some of our potential competitors could have, substantial competitive advantages such as:\n\u2022\npotential for broader market acceptance of their storage architectures and solutions;\n\u2022\ngreater name recognition and longer operating histories;\n\u2022\nlarger sales and marketing and customer support budgets and resources;\n\u2022\nbroader distribution and established relationships with distribution partners and end-customers;\n\u2022\nthe ability to bundle storage products with other technology products and services, or offer a broader range of storage solutions to better fit certain customers\u2019 needs;\n\u2022\nlower labor and development costs;\n\u2022\nlarger and more mature intellectual property portfolios;\n\u2022\nsubstantially greater financial, technical and other resources; and\n\u2022\ngreater resources to make acquisitions.\nOur ability to sell our products is highly dependent on the quality of our services offerings, and our failure to offer high quality support and professional services would have a material adverse affect on our sales of our products and results of operations.\nOur services include the assessment and design of solutions to meet our customers\u2019 data protection and storage management requirements and the efficient installation and deployment of our products based on specified business objectives. Further, once our products are deployed, our customers depend on us to resolve issues relating to our products. A high level of service is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our software. If our partners or we do not effectively install or deploy our applications, or succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, it would adversely affect our ability to sell software products to existing customers and could harm our reputation with potential customers. As a result, our failure to maintain high quality support and professional services would have a material adverse effect on our sales of our products and results of operations.\nFailure to achieve anticipated growth could harm our business and operating results.\nAchieving our anticipated growth will depend on a number of factors, some of which include:\n\u2022retention of key management, marketing and technical personnel;\n\u2022our ability to increase our customer base and to increase the sales of our products; and\n\u2022competitive conditions in the network storage infrastructure software market.\nWe cannot assure you that the anticipated growth will be achieved. The failure to achieve anticipated growth could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAdverse economic conditions or reduced IT spending may adversely impact our business.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for IT and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers. In general, worldwide economic conditions remain unstable, and these conditions make it difficult for our current and prospective customers and us to forecast and plan future business activities accurately, and they could cause our customers or prospective customers to reevaluate their decision to purchase our products or services. Weak global economic conditions, or a reduction in IT spending even if economic conditions improve, could adversely impact our business and operating results in a number of ways, including longer sales cycles, lower prices for our products, reduced bookings and lower or no growth.\nOur future quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur previous results are not necessarily indicative of our future performance and our future quarterly results may fluctuate significantly. Our future performance will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the economy;\n\u2022\nthe timing of securing software license contracts and the delivery of software and related revenue recognition;\n\u2022\nthe seasonality of information technology, including network storage products, spending;\n\u2022\nthe average unit selling price of our products;\n\u2022\nexisting or new competitors introducing better products at competitive prices before we do;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage successfully the complex and difficult process of qualifying our products with our customers;\n\u2022\nnew products or enhancements from us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to release new and innovative products;\n\u2022\nimport or export restrictions on our proprietary technology; and\n\u2022\npersonnel changes.\nMany of our expenses are relatively fixed and difficult to reduce or modify. As a result, the fixed nature of our expenses will magnify any adverse effect of a decrease in revenue on our operating results.\nThe ability to predict our future effective tax rates could impact our ability to accurately forecast future earnings.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the United States and the various foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and there are many transactions and calculations where the tax determination may be uncertain. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in our (i) earnings or losses; (ii) changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets; (iii) changes in tax laws; and (iv) other factors. Our ability to correctly predict our future effective tax rates based upon these possible changes could significantly impact our forecasted earnings.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future. For example, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the closing market price of our common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market fluctuated between $0.45 and $1.89. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by the following factors:\n\u2022\ndelisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, including changes in the timing of when we recognize revenue;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet financial estimates;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of other technology companies, particularly those in the network storage software market;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of any strategic alternatives;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, strategic alternatives, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nloss of one or more key customers;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of additional shares of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock pursuant to dividend rights; and\n\u2022\ndepartures of key personnel.\nThe stock market has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our performance.\nThe likelihood of a change of control in our company could be impacted by the fact that we have a significant amount of authorized but unissued preferred stock, outstanding Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock, a staggered Board of Directors and change of control agreements as well as certain provisions under Delaware law.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by our common stockholders, to issue up to an additional 1,100,000 shares of preferred stock on such terms and with such rights, preferences and designations, including, without limitation restricting dividends on our common stock, dilution of the voting power of our common stock and impairing the liquidation rights of the holders of our common stock, as the Board may determine without any vote of our common stockholders. Issuance of such preferred stock, depending upon the rights, preferences and designations thereof may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control. Moreover, our outstanding Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock provides the holders with certain rights in the event of a merger with a third party and if we are unable to redeem the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock prior to August 5, 2017 or if the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock elect to exercise their rights to require the Company to redeem the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock due to the failure of the Company to comply with the financial covenants covering the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock. In addition, certain \u201canti-takeover\u201d provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, among other things, may restrict the ability of our stockholders to authorize a merger, business combination or change of control. Further, we have a staggered Board of Directors and have entered into change of control agreements through either employment agreements or our 2005 Key Executive Severance Protection Plan or our Key Employee Change in Control Severance Agreement with certain executives. As a result, our stockholders may lose opportunities to dispose of their shares at favorable prices generally available in takeover attempts or that may be available under a merger proposal and the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may also be affected.\nOur business could be materially affected as a result of a natural disaster, terrorist acts, or other catastrophic events.\nWhile our headquarters facilities contain redundant power supplies and generators, our domestic and foreign operations, and the operations of our industry partners, remain susceptible to fire, floods, power loss, power shortages, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. Terrorist actions domestically or abroad could lead to business disruptions or to cancellations of customer orders or a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology, or could have direct impact on our marketing, administrative or financial functions and our financial condition could suffer. We continually look for alternatives to help mitigate any supply chain disruptions due to natural disasters, terrorist acts or other catastrophic events. However, our failure to mitigate these supply chain disruptions could impact our ability to procure and deliver products to our customers, which could adversely impact our overall financial condition.\nWe are dependent on a variety of IT and telecommunications systems, and any failure of these systems could adversely impact our business and operating results.\nWe depend on IT and telecommunications systems for our operations. These systems support a variety of functions including order processing, shipping, shipment tracking, billing, support center and internal information exchange.\nFailures or significant downtime of our IT or telecommunications systems could prevent us from taking customer orders, shipping products, billing customers, handling support calls, or communication among our offices. The Internet and individual websites have experienced a number of disruptions and slowdowns, some of which were caused by organized attacks. In addition, some websites have experienced security breakdowns. If we were to experience a security breakdown, disruption or breach that compromised sensitive information, it could harm our relationship with our customers. Our support centers are dependent upon telephone and data services provided by third party telecommunications service vendors and our IT and telecommunications system. Any significant increase in our IT and telecommunications costs or temporary or permanent loss of our IT or telecommunications systems could harm our relationships with our customers. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nUnited States Government export restrictions could impede our ability to sell our software to certain end users.\nCertain of our products include the ability for the end user to encrypt data. The United States, through the Bureau of Industry Security, places restrictions on the export of certain encryption technology. These restrictions may include: the requirement to have a license to export the technology; the requirement to have software licenses approved before export is allowed; and outright bans on the licensing of certain encryption technology to particular end users or to all end users in a particular country. Certain of our products are subject to various levels of export restrictions. These export restrictions could negatively impact our business.\nThe international nature of our business could have an adverse affect on our operating results.\nWe sell our products worldwide. Accordingly, our operating results could be materially adversely affected by various factors including regulatory, political, or economic conditions in a specific country or region, trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements, and acts of terrorism and international conflicts.\nAdditional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include, among others, longer accounts receivable payment cycles, difficulties in managing international operations, decreased flexibility in matching workforce needs as compared with the U.S., and potentially adverse tax consequences. Such factors could materially adversely affect our future international sales and, consequently, our operating results.\nForeign currency fluctuations may impact our revenue.\nOur licenses and services in Japan are sold in Yen. Many of our licenses and services in Australia, Canada, and in Europe are sold in Australian dollars, Canadian dollars and European Monetary Units (\u201cEuros\u201d), respectively. Changes in economic or political conditions globally and in any of the countries in which we operate could result in exchange rate movements, new currency or exchange controls or other restrictions being imposed on our operations.\nFluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our results of operations. Because our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, translation of sales or earnings generated in other currencies into U.S. dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the reported amount of those sales or earnings. Significant changes in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. For example, the Euro has weakened against the U.S. dollar by 4% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016.\nFluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which our earnings are generated make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. For purposes of accounting, the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, where the local currency is the functional currency, are translated using period-end exchange rates, and the revenue, expenses and cash flows of our foreign operations are translated using average exchange rates during each period.\nIn addition to currency translation risks, we incur currency transaction risk whenever we enter into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity. Given the volatility of exchange rates, we cannot be assured we will be able to effectively manage our currency transaction and/or translation risks. Volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Currency exchange rate fluctuations have not, in the past, resulted in a material impact on earnings. However, we may experience at times in the future an impact on earnings as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nBecause we conduct operations in China, risks associated with economic, political and social events in China could negatively affect our business and operating results.\nChina is a significant market for our products. We have an OEM agreement with Huawei which has historically provided us with significant revenue. As of December 31, 2016 we have 14 employees in China. Our operations in China are subject to a number of risks relating to China\u2019s economic and political systems, including:\n\u2022government controlled foreign exchange rate and limitations on the convertibility of the Chinese Renminbi;\n\u2022extensive government regulation;\n\u2022changing governmental policies relating to tax benefits available to foreign-owned businesses;\n\u2022the telecommunications infrastructure;\n\u2022relatively uncertain legal system; and\n\u2022uncertainties related to continued economic and social reform.\nAny significant interruption in our China operations, whether resulting from any of the above uncertainties, natural disasters or otherwise, could result in delays or disruptions in our revenue and our research development operations, either of which could cause our business and operating results to suffer.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business will suffer.\nOur success is dependent upon our proprietary technology. We have 27 patents issued, and numerous pending patent applications, numerous trademarks registered and multiple pending trademark applications related to our products. We cannot predict whether we will receive patents for our pending or future patent applications, and any patents that we own or that are issued to us may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which we sell and manufacture our products, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nWe also rely on trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, as well as the confidentiality and other restrictions contained in our respective sales contracts and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections afford only limited protection and if we are unable to protect our intellectual property our business and operating results may suffer.\nOur efforts to protect our intellectual property may cause us to become involved in costly and lengthy litigation, which could seriously harm our business.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights.\nWe were already subject to one action, which alleged that our technology infringed on patents held by a third party. While we settled this litigation, the fees and expenses of the litigation as well as the litigation settlement were expensive and the litigation diverted management\u2019s time and attention. Any additional litigation, regardless of its outcome, would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management\u2019s time and attention and might subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidate our intellectual property rights. Any potential intellectual property litigation against us could force us to take specific actions (any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business), including:\n\u2022\ncease selling our products that use the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nobtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology or trademark, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; or\n\u2022\nredesign those products that use infringing intellectual property or cease to use an infringing product or trademark.\nDevelopments limiting the availability of Open Source software could impact our ability to deliver products and could subject us to costly litigation.\nMany of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties, including \u201cOpen Source\u201d software. At least one intellectual property rights holder has alleged that it holds the rights to software traditionally viewed as Open Source. In addition, United States courts have not interpreted the terms of many open source licenses, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our appliances. We could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our software, to re-engineer our software, to discontinue the sale of our software in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or to litigate any disputes relating to our use of open source software, any of which could harm our business. There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.\nThe loss of any of our key personnel could harm our business.\nOur success depends upon the continued contributions of our key employees, many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace. We do not have key person life insurance on any of our personnel. Worldwide competition for skilled employees in the network storage software industry is extremely intense. In particular our success is dependent on our executive management team, including Gary Quinn, our President and Chief Executive Officer, whose employment agreement expires in July 2017. If we are unable to retain existing employees or hire and integrate new employees, our business, financial condition and operating results could suffer.\nIf actual results or events differ materially from our estimates and assumptions, our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosure in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to establish policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 describes the significant accounting policies and estimates essential to preparing our financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual future results may differ materially from these estimates. We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, our estimates and assumptions.\nOur agreements with the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock contain covenants that could limit our ability to obtain financing using our equity. In addition, if we engage in future financings, we may have to use the proceeds to redeem the preferred stock held by such holders. This could cause us to have difficulty in obtaining capital necessary to run our business.\nOur agreements with the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock give such holders veto power over certain future financings, and give such holders certain rights to participate in any subsequent financing, whether through debt or equity (subject to certain exclusions). These participation rights could discourage a potential investor or a potential lender from making financing available to us on favorable terms. Because of these covenants, if we determine that we are in need of additional capital, we might not be able to obtain it. In addition, our agreements with the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock provide that if, at the time of certain future debt or equity financings, the proceeds of which exceed $5 million, the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock still have outstanding Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock, then we must offer to repurchase their Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock. The holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock have the right to accept the offer or to retain their Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock. If we do a financing, and the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock elect to have their Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock repurchased, then the capital raised in excess of $5 million will go to repurchase the holders\u2019 Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock, instead of being able to be used for our business.\nOur agreements with the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock prevent us from undertaking certain transactions or incurring certain indebtedness without such holders\u2019 consent or unless the Series A redeemable convertible\npreferred stock held by such holders is repurchased. This could hurt our ability to sell underperforming assets or lines of business or to obtain financing.\nOur agreements with the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock prevent us from undertaking certain transactions or incurring certain debt without such holders\u2019 consent or unless the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock held by such holders\u2019 is repurchased. These transactions include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022A merger with, or the sale of substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets or capital stock, to a third party;\n\u2022Assumption of indebtedness in excess of 80% of the Company\u2019s accounts receivable; and\n\u2022The sale, license or other disposition of 10% or more of the tangible assets or capital stock of the Company.\nThis could limit our ability to sell off underperforming assets or business lines. It could also prevent us from obtaining financing we may need to run or to grow our business.\nThe holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock are entitled to dividends on the Series A redeemable The holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock are entitled to dividends on the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock they hold. Depending on whether these dividends are paid in cash or stock, the payment of these dividends will either decrease cash that is available to us to invest in our business or dilute the holdings of all other stockholders.\nOur agreements with the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock provide that such holders will receive quarterly dividends on the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock at prime rate plus 5%, subject to a maximum dividend rate of 10%. If we do not have at least $1.0 million in positive cash flow for any calendar quarter after giving effect to the payment of such dividends, then we can, at our election, pay such dividends in whole or in part in cash, provided that cash flow from operations is not negative, and the remainder can be accrued or paid in common stock to the extent certain equity conditions are satisfied. We also have the ability to accrue and roll over dividends. During 2016, the Company issued 624,009 shares of the Company's common stock as payment for the fourth quarter 2015 and the first three quarters of 2016 dividends. As of December 31, 2016, due to the lack of sufficient surplus to pay dividends as required by the Delaware General Business Corporation Law, the Company was not permitted to pay the fourth quarter dividend in cash or common stock and accrued its fourth quarter 2016 dividend. Accordingly, under Item 1A. of Form S-3, the Company will not be S-3 eligible when it files this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result, the Company will not be eligible to utilize the shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the SEC in 2016. This inability to use Form S-3 for future capital raises could impact our ability to efficiently and expeditiously raise financing. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's liability for dividends to the holders of the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock totaled $0.2 million. The payment of future dividends in cash will reduce the cash that we have available to invest in our business. There can be no assurance that we will have enough cash to pay future dividends in cash. If any future dividends are paid in common stock, this will dilute the holdings of all other stockholders.\nUnknown Factors\nAdditional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or which currently we deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect us.", "PERMNO": 89099, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "FALC"}
