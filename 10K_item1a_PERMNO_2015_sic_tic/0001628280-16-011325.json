{"cik": "14930", "company": "BRUNSWICK CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company's operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of the Company's common stock.\nWorldwide economic conditions have adversely affected the Company's industries, businesses and results of operations and may continue to do so.\nIn times of economic uncertainty and contraction, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and to defer expenditures for discretionary items, which adversely affects the Company's financial performance, especially in its marine businesses. Although the Company has worked to expand the portions of its portfolio that are less susceptible to economic cycles, there is still a portion of the business that remains cyclical and highly sensitive to personal discretionary spending levels. In addition, general economic conditions in certain international markets, including Canada, Brazil and Russia, continue to be challenging with respect to weak currencies, commodity market impacts and corresponding weak economic conditions.\nAny deterioration in general economic conditions that diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may reduce the Company's sales or the Company may decide to sell its products at a discount, thus adversely affecting its financial results, including increasing the potential for future impairment charges. The Company cannot predict the timing or strength of economic recovery, either worldwide or in the specific markets in which it competes.\nChanges in currency exchange rates can adversely affect the Company's results.\nA portion of the Company's sales are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Consequently, a strong U.S. dollar may adversely affect reported revenues. The Company also maintains a portion of its cost structure in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which partially mitigates the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar. This includes manufacturing operations for boats in Europe, Brazil and Canada, fitness equipment in Europe, as well as smaller outboard engines purchased from the Company's joint venture in Japan. A portion of SG&A costs are also transacted in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. The Company maintains hedging programs to reduce its risk to currency fluctuations; however, it is not possible to hedge against all currency risk, especially over the long term. The Company also continues to evaluate its supply chain and cost structure for opportunities to further mitigate risks associated with foreign currency.\nThe Company sells U.S. manufactured products into certain international markets in U.S. dollars, including the sale of products into Canada, Europe and Latin America. Demand for the Company's products in these markets may be adversely affected by a strengthening U.S. dollar. The Company has certain competitors with cost positions based outside the U.S., including Asian-based outboard engine and fitness equipment manufacturers, European-based large fiberglass boat manufacturers and a European-based fitness equipment manufacturer. A strengthening U.S. dollar may provide a cost advantage to these competitors, which could result in pricing pressures. These factors existed throughout a portion of 2014 and in 2015 and the Company does not believe they resulted in any material change in its competitive position.\nThe inability to make targeted acquisitions or failure to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial results.\nThe Company's growth initiatives include making targeted acquisitions, which may depend on the availability of suitable acquisition targets at acceptable terms and the Company's ability to complete such acquisitions. There can be no assurance that acquisitions will be consummated or that, if consummated, they will be successful. Acquisitions pose risks with respect to the Company's ability to project and evaluate market demand, potential synergies and cost savings, make correct accounting estimates and achieve anticipated business goals and objectives. As the Company continues to grow, in part, through acquisitions, its success depends on its ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. If acquired businesses do not achieve forecasted results or otherwise fail to meet projections, it could affect the Company's results of operations.\nNor can the Company assure that newly acquired businesses will be timely and successfully integrated into the Company's operations. Acquisitions present a number of integration risks, including that the acquisition may: disrupt operations in core, adjacent or acquired businesses; require more time than anticipated to be fully integrated into Company operations and systems; create more costs than projected; divert management attention; create the potential of losing customer, supplier or other critical business relationships; and pose difficulties retaining employees. The inability to successfully integrate new businesses may result in higher production costs, lost sales or otherwise negatively affect earnings and financial results.\nIf the Company is not able to successfully implement its strategic plan and growth initiatives, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and financial condition.\nThe Company's ability to continue generating positive cash flow and profits will depend partly on its sustained successful execution of its strategic plan and growth initiatives, including making acquisitions and expanding into new adjacent markets and customers. The Company's ability to succeed in its strategic plan and growth initiatives will require significant capital investment and management attention, which may result in the diversion of these resources from the core business and other business issues and opportunities. Additionally, any new initiative is subject to certain risks, including customer acceptance, competition, the ability to manufacture the products on schedule and to specification, the ability to create the necessary supply chain and/or the ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to develop and successfully implement its strategic plan and growth initiatives to a point at which they will become profitable or generate positive cash flow. If the Company cannot successfully execute its strategic plan and growth initiatives, the Company's financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nFiscal concerns may negatively impact worldwide credit conditions and could have an adverse effect on the Company's industries, businesses and financial condition.\nConcerns regarding fiscal policy could have a material adverse impact on worldwide economic conditions, the financial markets and availability of credit and, consequently, may negatively affect the Company's industries, businesses and overall financial condition. Customers often finance purchases of the Company's products, particularly boats. Credit market conditions continued to improve in 2015, but remained less favorable overall than those in existence prior to the decline in marine retail demand. While interest rates are generally lower, there continue to be fewer lenders, tighter underwriting and loan approval criteria, greater down payment requirements and negative loan equity, particularly in larger products. If credit conditions worsen, and adversely affect the ability of customers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in sales of the Company's products or delay improvement in its sales.\nAn inability of the Company's dealers and distributors to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect the Company's sales.\nThe Company's dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchasing the Company's products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These sources of financing are vital to the Company's ability to sell products through its distribution network, particularly to its boat and engine dealers. A significant portion of the Company's domestic and international boat and engine sales to dealers are financed through entities affiliated with GE Capital Corporation (GECC), including BAC (the Company's 49 percent owned joint venture, with the other 51 percent being owned by CDFV, a subsidiary of GECC), which provides floorplan financing to domestic marine dealers. In 2015, GECC reached an agreement with Wells Fargo & Company to sell its Commercial Distribution Finance business, including CDFV and its interest in the BAC joint venture. The transaction is expected to be completed in 2016 and the Company does not anticipate it will have a material effect on BAC.\nHowever, a number of factors will continue to influence the availability and terms of financing offered by the Company's dealer floorplan financing providers, including: their ability to access certain capital markets, including the securitization and the commercial paper markets, and to fund their operations in a cost effective manner; the performance of their overall credit portfolios; their willingness to accept the risks associated with lending to marine dealers; and the overall creditworthiness of those dealers. The Company's sales could be adversely affected if BAC were to be terminated or if financing terms change unfavorably. This could require dealers to find alternative sources of financing, including the Company providing this financing directly to dealers, which could require additional capital to fund the associated receivables.\nThe Company's financial results may be adversely affected if it is unable to maintain effective distribution.\nThe Company relies on third-party dealers and distributors to sell the majority of its products, particularly in the marine businesses. The ability to maintain a reliable network of dealers is essential to the Company's success. The Company faces competition from other manufacturers in attracting and retaining distributors and independent boat dealers. A significant deterioration in the number or effectiveness of the Company's dealers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results.\nWeakening demand for marine products could adversely affect the financial performance of the Company's dealers. In particular, reduced cash flow from decreases in sales and tightening credit markets may impair dealers' ability to fund operations. Inability to fund operations can force dealers to cease business, and the Company may be unable to obtain alternate distribution in the vacated market. An inability to obtain alternate distribution could unfavorably affect the Company's net sales\nthrough reduced market presence. If conditions were to worsen, the Company anticipates that dealer failures or voluntary market exits could increase, especially if overall retail demand materially declines.\nFinally, labor disruption at major ports and shipping hubs around the world may adversely affect the Company and its distributors' ability to transport raw materials to its facilities and products to its distributors and end-use customers, potentially resulting in increased transportation costs and lost sales.\nAdverse economic, credit and capital market conditions could have a negative impact on the Company's financial results.\nThe Company does not frequently rely on short-term capital markets to meet its working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends or fund employee benefit programs; however, the Company does maintain short-term borrowing facilities which can be used to meet these capital requirements. In addition, over the long term, the Company may determine that it is necessary to access the capital markets to refinance existing long-term indebtedness or for other initiatives.\nAdverse global economic conditions, market volatility and heightened governmental regulation could lead to volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. This could adversely affect the Company's ability to access capital and credit markets or increase the cost to do so, which could have a negative impact on its business, financial results and competitive position.\nInventory reductions by major dealers, retailers and independent boat builders could adversely affect the Company's financial results.\nThe Company and its dealers, retailers and other distributors could decide to reduce the number of units they hold, particularly if demand trails forecasted levels or if new product introductions are expected to replace older products. Such efforts tend to result in wholesale sales reductions in excess of retail sales reductions and would likely result in lower production levels of the Company's products, thus resulting in lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in the Company's manufacturing facilities and lower margins. While actions taken continue to keep dealer inventories at appropriate levels, potential future inventory reductions by dealers and independent boat builder customers could impair the Company's future sales and results of operations.\nThe Company may be required to repurchase inventory or accounts of certain dealers.\nThe Company has agreements with certain third-party finance companies to provide financing to the Company's customers to enable the purchase of its products. In connection with these agreements, the Company either may have obligations to repurchase the Company's products from the finance company, or may have recourse obligations to the finance company on the dealer\u2019s receivables. These obligations may be triggered if the Company's dealers default on their debt obligations to the finance companies.\nThe Company's maximum contingent obligation to repurchase inventory and its maximum contingent recourse obligations on customer receivables have been reduced since the recession and are less than the total balances of dealer financings outstanding under these programs, as the Company's obligations under certain of these arrangements are subject to caps, or are limited based on the age of product. The Company's risk related to these arrangements is mitigated by the proceeds it receives on the resale of repurchased product to other dealers, or by recoveries on receivables purchased under the recourse obligations.\nThe Company's inventory repurchase obligations relate primarily to the inventory floorplan credit facilities of the Company's boat and engine dealers. The Company's actual historical repurchase experience related to these repurchase arrangements has been substantially less than the Company's maximum contractual obligations. If dealers file for bankruptcy or cease operations, the Company could incur losses associated with the repurchase of the Company's products. In addition, as the repurchases may be triggered by dealer bankruptcies, the Company's net sales and earnings may be unfavorably affected as a result of reduced market coverage and the associated decline in sales.\nDeclines in marine industry demand could cause an increase in future repurchase activity, or could require the Company to incur losses in excess of established reserves. In addition, the Company's cash flow and loss experience could be adversely affected if repurchased inventory is not successfully distributed to other dealers in a timely manner, or if the recovery rate on the resale of the product declines. The finance companies could require changes in repurchase or recourse terms that would result in an increase in the Company's contractual contingent obligations.\nThe loss of key customers or critical suppliers could harm the Company's business.\nIf the Company were to experience the loss of a key customer, its business could be negatively affected in a significant way. Similarly, if one of the Company's most critical suppliers were to close its operations, cease manufacturing or otherwise fail to deliver an essential component necessary to the Company's manufacturing operations, it could have a detrimental effect on the Company's ability to manufacture and sell its products, resulting in an interruption in business operations and/or a loss of sales. Additionally, certain customers may negotiate more favorable pricing of Company products. In an effort to mitigate the risk\nassociated with reliance on such accounts and suppliers, the Company continually works to monitor such relationships, maintain a complete and competitive product lineup and identify alternative suppliers for key components.\nThe Company's success depends upon the continued strength of its brands.\nThe Company believes that its brands, including Mercury, Life Fitness, Sea Ray, Boston Whaler and Lund, significantly contribute to the Company's success, and that maintaining and enhancing the brands are important to expanding the Company's customer base. Failure to continue to promote and protect the Company's brands may adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations. Further, in connection with the divestiture of the bowling businesses, the Company licensed certain trademarks and servicemarks, including use of the name \u201cBrunswick,\u201d to the acquiring companies. The Company's reputation may be adversely affected by the purchasers' inappropriate use of the marks or of the name Brunswick, including potential negative publicity, loss of confidence or other damage to its image due to this licensed use.\nThe Company has a fixed cost base that can affect its profitability in a declining sales environment.\nThe fixed cost levels of operating production facilities can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. The Company has maintained discipline over its fixed cost base during the economic recovery; however, the Company's profitability is dependent, in part, on its ability to spread fixed costs over an increasing number of products sold and shipped, and if the Company is required to reduce its rate of production, gross margins could be negatively affected. Consequently, decreased demand or the need to reduce inventories can lower the Company's ability to absorb fixed costs and materially impact its results.\nSuccessfully managing the expansion of its manufacturing footprint is critical to the Company's operating and financial results.\nOver the past three years, the Company has made strategic capital investments in capacity expansion activities that will enable the affected businesses to successfully capture growth opportunities and enhance product offerings. Recently, the Company reactivated its Sykes Creek manufacturing facility in Merritt Island, Florida, and has initiated or completed expansion activities at its facilities in Edgewater and Palm Coast, Florida; Ramsey, Minnesota; Fond du Lac, Wisconsin; Petit-Rechain, Belgium; and Kiskoros, Hungary. The Company must carefully manage these capital improvement projects and expansions to ensure they meet cost targets, comply with applicable environmental, safety and other regulations and uphold high-quality workmanship.\nMoving production to a different plant or expanding capacity at an existing facility involves risks, including difficulties initiating production within the cost and timeframe estimated, supplying product to customers when expected and attracting sufficient numbers of skilled workers to handle additional production demands. The inability to successfully implement the Company's manufacturing footprint initiatives could adversely affect its ability to meet customer demand for products and could increase the cost of production versus projections, both of which could result in a significant adverse impact on operating and financial results. Additionally, plants experiencing demand increases may face manufacturing inefficiencies, additional expenses, including higher wages, and cost inefficiencies, which could exceed projections and negatively impact financial results.\nThe Company relies on third-party suppliers for the supply of the raw materials, parts and components necessary to manufacture its products. The Company's financial results may be adversely affected by an increase in cost, disruption of supply, shortage or defect in raw materials, parts or product components.\nOutside suppliers and contract manufacturers provide the Company with raw materials used in the Company's manufacturing processes, including oil, aluminum, copper, steel and resins, as well as product parts and components. The prices for these raw materials, parts and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and, in some instances, commodity prices. Substantial increases in the prices of the Company's raw materials, parts and components would increase the Company's operating costs, and could reduce its profitability if the Company could not recoup the increased costs through higher product prices.\nIn addition, some components used in the Company's manufacturing processes, including certain engine components, furniture, upholstery and boat windshields are available from a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply the Company with the parts and components it needs, which could significantly disrupt the Company's operations. It may be difficult to find a replacement supplier for a limited or sole source raw material, part or component without significant delay or on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier's variation in a raw material, part or component, either unknown to the Company or incompatible with the Company's manufacturing process, could harm the Company's ability to manufacture products.\nSome of the risks that could disrupt the Company's operations, impair the Company's ability to deliver products to the Company's customers and negatively affect the Company's financial results include: an increase in the cost of, defects in or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of some of these raw materials, parts or products that may be caused by delayed start-up periods the Company's suppliers experience as they increase production efforts; financial pressures on the Company's suppliers\ndue to a weakening economy or unfavorable conditions in other end markets; a deterioration of the Company's relationships with suppliers; or events such as natural disasters, power outages or labor strikes. In addition to the risks described above regarding interruption of supplies, which are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, the exclusive supplier of a key component potentially could exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims or other terms.\nThe Company's manufacturing operations increased production in 2015 and are expected to continue to do so in 2016 and, consequently, the Company's need for raw materials and supplies will increase. The Company's suppliers must be prepared to ramp up operations and, in many cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill the orders placed by the Company and other customers. The Company experienced periodic supply shortages in 2015. The Company continues to work to address this issue by identifying alternative suppliers, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies and continually monitoring the capabilities of its supplier base. In the future, however, the Company may experience shortages of, delayed delivery of and/or increased prices for key materials, parts and supplies that are essential to its manufacturing operations.\nThe Company's pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside its control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial data and experience and legal and regulatory changes.\nThe Company's funding obligations and pension expense for its four U.S. qualified pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans\u2019 liabilities, actuarial data and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements. Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, liquidity or shareholders\u2019 equity. In addition, a portion of the Company's pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if economic conditions or financial markets weaken. The level of the Company's funding of its qualified pension plan liabilities was approximately 74 percent as of December 31, 2015. The Company's future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate and asset levels along with a decline in the estimated return on plan assets. In addition, as a result of changes in regulations, legal changes could require the Company to make increased contributions to the pension plans; these contributions could be material and negatively affect the Company's cash flow.\nThe Company is currently mitigating these risks by transitioning the asset allocation in the pensions to a greater percentage of fixed income investments and by lowering plan liabilities through the offering of lump-sum settlements to certain plan participants and transferring obligations to a third party through annuity purchases.\nThe timing and amount of the Company's share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $200 million of the Company's outstanding common stock, to be systematically completed in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions over approximately a two-year period. In 2016, the Board increased the Company's existing share repurchase authorization by $300 million. The amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors. Important considerations that could cause the Company to limit, suspend or delay the Company's stock repurchases include unfavorable market conditions, the trading price of the Company's common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities available to the Company from time to time and the availability of cash. If the Company delays, limits or suspends the Company's stock repurchase program, the Company's stock price and earnings per share may be negatively affected.\nHigher energy and fuel costs can affect the Company's results.\nHigher energy and fuel costs result in increases in operating expenses at the Company's manufacturing facilities and in the cost of shipping products to customers. In addition, increases in energy costs can adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials such as resins and foam that are used in many of the Company's marine products. Also, higher fuel prices may have an adverse effect on demand for marine retail products, as they increase the cost of boat ownership and possibly affect product usage.\nThe Company's profitability may suffer as a result of competitive pricing and other pressures.\nThe introduction of lower-priced alternative products by other companies can hurt the Company's competitive position in all of its businesses. The Company is constantly subject to competitive pressures in which predominantly international manufacturers may pursue a strategy of aggressive pricing, particularly during periods when local currency weakens versus the U.S. dollar. Such pricing pressure may limit the Company's ability to increase prices for its products in response to raw material and other cost increases and negatively affect the Company's profit margins.\nIn addition, international boat builders continue to expand distribution in the U.S. markets, mainly in the large fiberglass boat segment, thereby introducing additional product options into a market in which the Company believes itself to be a market leader. The market for large boats expanded in 2015, partially due to the success of the Company's new product offerings, but as these new entrants introduce potentially lower cost product alternatives, demand could be diverted away from the Company's premium products.\nFinally, the Company's independent boat builder customers may react negatively to potential competition for their products from Brunswick\u2019s own boat brands, which can lead them to purchase marine engines and marine engine supplies from competing marine engine manufacturers and may negatively affect demand for the Company's products.\nThe Company's ability to remain competitive depends on the successful introduction of new product offerings and the ability to meet customer expectations.\nThe Company believes that its customers rigorously evaluate manufacturers' quality and capability to innovate and develop new products when making purchasing decisions. The Company's ability to remain competitive and meet its growth objectives may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable new products, gain market acceptance of new products, generate sufficient capital to fund new product development or obtain adequate intellectual property protection for new products. To meet ever-changing consumer demands, timing of market entry and pricing of new products are critical. As a result, the Company may not be able to introduce new products necessary to remain competitive in all markets that it serves. Furthermore, the Company must deliver quality products that meet or exceed its customers' expectations regarding product quality and after-sales service.\nThe Company's business operations could be negatively impacted by the failure or a breach of its information technology systems.\nThe Company manages its global business operations through a variety of information technology (IT) systems which it continually enhances to increase efficiency and security. These systems govern all aspects of the Company's operations around the world. The Company is dependent on these systems for commercial transactions, customer interactions and image projection. Some of the systems are based on legacy technology and operate with a minimal level of available support. Although the Company has invested in strategies to prevent a failure or breach, if one of these legacy systems or another of the Company's key IT systems were to fail or if the Company's IT systems were unable to communicate effectively, this could result in missed or delayed sales or lost opportunities for cost reduction or efficient cash management. The Company exchanges information with hundreds of trading partners across all aspects of its commercial operations. Any breach in security or disruption of the communications could result in erroneous transactions or loss of reputation and confidence. The Company has numerous portals to engage in e-commerce and e-marketing and its systems may also contain personal information in connection with human resources, financial services or other business operations; therefore, the Company must remain diligent in protecting itself from malicious cyber attacks. A successful cyber attack or data security breach could result in a disruption of services, fraudulent transactions or disclosure of confidential information. This could negatively affect the Company's relationships with its customers or trading partners, lead to potential claims against the Company and damage its image and reputation.\nThe Company competes with a variety of other activities for consumers' scarce discretionary income and leisure time.\nThe vast majority of the Company's products are used for recreational purposes, and demand for the Company's products can be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers' time, including other forms of recreation, religious, cultural and community activities. Additionally, any pressures or slow growth in consumers' discretionary income may influence consumers' willingness to purchase and enjoy the Company's products.\nThe Company manufactures and sells products that create exposure to potential product liability, warranty liability, personal injury and property damage claims and litigation.\nThe Company's products may expose it to potential product liability, warranty liability, personal injury or property damage claims relating to the use of those products. The Company's manufacturing footprint actions and production of new products could result in product quality issues, thereby increasing the risk of litigation and potential liability. To address this risk, the Company has established a global, enterprise-wide program charged with the responsibility for addressing, reviewing and reporting on product integrity issues. Historically, the resolution of such claims has not materially adversely affected the Company's business, and the Company maintains what it believes to be adequate insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of these risks. However, the Company may experience material losses in the future, incur significant costs to defend claims or issue product recalls, or experience claims in excess of its insurance coverage or that are not covered by insurance. Furthermore, the Company's reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about its products. The Company\nrecords reserves for known potential liabilities, but there is the possibility that actual losses may exceed these reserves and therefore negatively impact earnings.\nIf the Company's intellectual property protection is inadequate, others may be able to use its technologies and thereby impair the Company's ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company regards much of the technology underlying its products as proprietary. The Company relies on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws; employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements; and other contracts to establish and protect its technology and other intellectual property rights. The steps the Company takes to protect its proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of the Company's technology, or third parties may independently develop similar technology. Agreements containing protections may be breached or terminated, the Company may not have adequate remedies for any such breach and existing patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws may afford limited protection. Policing unauthorized use of the Company's intellectual property is difficult, particularly in many regions outside the United States. A third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use the Company's products or technology without authorization. The Company may be required to litigate to defend against infringement claims or to protect its intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial cost and divert management's attention. Further, the Company might not prevail in such litigation and it may be forced to seek licenses or royalty arrangements from third parties, which the Company may not be able to obtain on reasonable terms, or the Company may be forced to stop using products that included the challenged intellectual property, which could harm its business.\nCompliance with environmental, zoning and other obligations under various laws and regulations will increase costs and may reduce demand for the Company's products.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including product safety, environmental, health and safety and other regulations. While the Company believes that it maintains all requisite licenses and permits and that it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, a failure to satisfy these and other regulatory requirements could cause the Company to incur fines or penalties, and compliance could increase the cost of operations. The adoption of additional laws, rules and regulations, including higher emissions standards, could increase the Company's manufacturing costs, increase consumer pricing and reduce consumer demand for the Company's products.\nEnvironmental restrictions, boat plant emission restrictions and permitting and zoning requirements can limit production capacity, access to water for boating, marina and storage space. In addition, certain jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States require or are considering requiring a license to operate a recreational boat. While such licensing requirements are not expected to be unduly restrictive, they may deter potential customers, thereby reducing the Company's sales. Furthermore, regulations allowing the sale of fuel containing higher levels of ethanol for automobiles, which is not appropriate or intended for use in marine engines, may nonetheless result in increased warranty, service costs, product dissatisfaction and other claims against the Company if boaters mistakenly use this fuel in marine engines, causing damage to and the degradation of components in their marine engines.\nThe Company's manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Accordingly, the Company is subject to regulations regarding these substances, and the misuse or mishandling of such substances could expose it to liabilities, including claims for property or natural resources damages or personal injury, or fines. The Company is also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of the Company's current or former properties or another location where it has disposed of hazardous materials, the Company may be held liable for the contamination, regardless of knowledge or whether it was at fault in connection with the release, and the amount of such liability could be material.\nAdditionally, the Company is subject to laws governing its relationship with its employees, including, but not limited to, employment obligations as a federal contractor and employee wage, hour and benefit issues, such as pension funding and health care benefits. Changes to legislation or regulations governing its employment obligations could increase the cost of the Company's operations.\nIncreases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial results.\nChanges in domestic and international tax legislation could expose the Company to additional tax liability or possibly require changes which lower deferred tax asset values. Although the Company carefully monitors changes in tax laws and works to mitigate the impact of proposed changes, such changes may negatively impact the Company's financial results. In addition, any increase in individual income tax rates would negatively affect the Company\u2019s potential customers' discretionary income and could\ndecrease the demand for its products. Finally, governments in many jurisdictions are increasing their audit activity and are engaging in other projects, such as those related to alleged base erosion and profit shifting. This increase in activity involves increased costs to the Company for having to resolve these potential disputes and from the potential additional taxes which may be assessed.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names and other long-lived assets could negatively affect the Company's consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the Company's trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, the Company makes assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends and market and economic conditions. Such analyses further require the Company to make certain assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability. The Company could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment if it experiences disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of the Company's business or market capitalization declines.\nThe Company also continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable. The Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable.\nIf the future operating performance of the Company's reporting units is not sufficient, the Company could be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Impairment charges could substantially affect the Company's reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded. In addition, impairment charges could indicate a reduction in business value which could limit the Company's ability to obtain adequate financing in the future. As of December 31, 2015, goodwill was approximately 9 percent of total assets and included $272.5 million of goodwill related to the Life Fitness segment and $26.2 million of goodwill related to the Marine Engine segment.\nSome of the Company's operations are conducted by joint ventures that are not operated solely for its benefit.\nSome of the Company's operations are carried on through jointly owned companies such as BAC, Bella and Tohatsu Marine Corporation. With respect to these joint ventures, the Company shares ownership and management responsibility of these companies with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as the Company. These joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for the Company's exclusive benefit.\nA significant portion of the Company's revenue is derived from international sources, which exposes it to additional uncertainty.\nThe Company intends to continue to expand its international operations and customer base as part of its growth strategy. Sales outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, are subject to various risks, including government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, foreign currency effects, tariffs, customs duties, inflation, difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, compliance with international laws, treaties and regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory environments, disruptions in distribution, dependence on foreign personnel and unions, as well as economic and social instability. In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries. If the Company continues to expand its business globally, its success will depend, in part, on the Company's ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks. These and other factors may have a material impact on the Company's international operations or its business as a whole.\nThe Company's operations are dependent on its ability to attract and retain key contributors and on the successful implementation of its succession plans.\nMuch of the Company's future success depends on, among other factors, its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including executive officers. If the Company is not successful in its efforts, the Company may be unable to meet its operating goals and plans, which may impact the Company's financial results. In order to manage this risk, the Company performs an annual review of management succession plans with the Board of Directors, including reviewing executive officer and other key positions. The most recent executive officer transitions were planned and were subject to this process. The Company believes that this process substantially mitigates the risk associated with these transitions.\nAdverse weather conditions can have a negative effect on marine revenues.\nChanges in seasonal weather conditions can have a significant effect on the Company's operating and financial results, especially in the marine businesses. Sales of the Company's marine products are generally stronger just before and during spring and summer, and favorable weather during these months generally has had a positive effect on consumer demand. Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall or drought conditions during these periods can reduce demand. Hurricanes and other storms can result in the disruption of the Company's distribution channel, operations or supply chain. Additionally, in the event that climate change occurs, which could result in environmental changes including, but not limited to, severe weather, rising sea levels or reduced access to water, the Company's business could be disrupted and negatively affected.\nInstability in locations where the Company maintains a significant presence could adversely impact the Company's business operations.\nThe Company has established a global presence, with manufacturing, sales, distribution and retail locations around the world. Changing conditions in those locations, including, but not limited to, political instability, civil unrest and an increase in criminal activity, could have a negative impact on the Company's local manufacturing and other business operations. Decreased stability in those regions where the Company conducts business poses a risk of business interruption and delays in shipments of materials, components and finished goods, as well as a risk of decreased local retail demand for the Company's products in those regions.\nCatastrophic events, including natural and environmental disasters, could have a negative effect on the Company's operations and financial results.\nThe occurrence of natural and environmental disasters, including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and environmental spills could decrease consumer demand for and sales of the Company's products. If such an occurrence takes place in one of Brunswick's major sales markets, the Company could experience a decrease in sales. Additionally, if such an event occurs near the Company's business, manufacturing facilities or key suppliers' facilities, the affected locations could experience an interruption in business operations and/or their operating systems. The Company could be uniquely affected by a catastrophic event due to the location of certain of its boat facilities in coastal Florida and the size of the manufacturing operation in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.", "PERMNO": 10874, "SIC": 3510, "TIC": "BC"}
