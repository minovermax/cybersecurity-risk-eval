Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors:\nCOVID-19 Pandemic-Related Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the duration and extent of this impact is subject to a high degree of uncertainty.\nCOVID-19 is continuing to spread through the United States and the world. The spread of highly infectious or contagious diseases could cause, and the spread of COVID-19 has caused, severe disruptions in the U.S. economy at large, and for small businesses in particular, which could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations. The resulting concerns on the part of the U.S. and global populations have resulted in a recessionary environment, reduced economic activity and caused significant volatility in the global stock markets. The Company has experienced disruptions across the Company\u2019s business due to these effects, leading to slowdowns in loan collections.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a decline in certain of our clients\u2019 businesses, a decrease in consumer confidence, an increase in unemployment and a disruption in the services provided by our vendors. Certain of the Company\u2019s borrowers are in or have exposure to the hotel, restaurant, arts/entertainment/recreation and retail industries and are located in areas that are or were quarantined or under stay-at-home orders Continued disruption to our clients\u2019 businesses could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures and losses on our loans, declines in assets under management and wealth management revenues, negatively impact regional economic conditions, result in declines in local loan demand, liquidity of loan guarantors, loan collateral (particularly in real estate), loan originations and deposit availability and negatively impact the implementation of our growth strategy.\nThe initial distribution of vaccines has been slow, and there may continue to be challenges with producing and distributing sufficient quantities of the vaccines. If the general public is unwilling or unable to access effective vaccines and therapies, this may also prolong the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, new variants of COVID-19 may increase the spread or severity of COVID-19 and previously developed vaccines and therapies may not be as effective against new COVID-19 variants.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic we may experience adverse financial consequences due to a number of other factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf increased unemployment and decreased consumer confidence and business generally, leading to an increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures;\n\u25cf ratings downgrades, credit deterioration and defaults in many industries, including hotel, restaurant, transportation, long-term healthcare, retail and commercial real estate, which may lead to increased provision expense;\n\u25cf a sudden and significant reduction in the valuation of the equity, fixed-income and commodity markets and the significant increase in the volatility of those markets;\n\u25cf as a result of the decline in the Federal Reserve\u2019s target federal funds rate to near 0% (or possibly below 0% in the future), the yield on our assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reducing our net interest margin and reducing net income;\n\u25cf a further and sustained decline in our stock price or the occurrence of what management would deem to be a triggering event that could, under certain circumstances, cause management to perform impairment testing on our goodwill and other intangible assets that could result in an impairment charge being recorded for that period, and adversely impact our results of operations and the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends to us;\n\u25cf the negative effect on earnings resulting from the subsidiary banks modifying loans and agreeing to loan payment deferrals due to the COVID-19 crisis;\n\u25cf a decrease in fees for customer services;\n\u25cf a reduction in the value of the assets that the Company manages or otherwise administers or services for others, affecting related fee income and demand for the Company\u2019s services;\n\u25cf increased demand on our liquidity as we meet borrowers\u2019 needs and cover expenses related to our business continuity plan;\n\u25cf the potential for reduced liquidity and its negative effect on our capital and leverage ratios;\n\u25cf federal and state taxes may increase, including as a result of the effects of the pandemic on governmental budgets, which could reduce our net income;\n\u25cf FDIC premiums could increase if the agency experiences additional resolution costs;\n\u25cf increased cyber and payment fraud risk due to increased online and remote activity; and\n\u25cf other operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices because of the pandemic and governmental actions to contain it.\nOverall, we believe that the economic impact from COVID-19 may be severe and could have a material and adverse impact on our business and result in significant losses in our loan portfolio, all of which would adversely and materially impact our earnings and capital. The speed and strength of any economic recovery from the pandemic is subject to a high degree of uncertainty, but is expected to be affected by further developments in the pandemic. Among other things, this will depend on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in our markets, the development, distribution and supply of vaccines, therapies and other public health initiatives to control the spread of the disease, the nature and size of federal economic stimulus and other governmental efforts, and the possibility of additional state lockdown or stay-at-home orders in our markets in response to the recent surge in the number of COVID-19 cases. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and as a result, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change.\nThe U.S. government and banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve, have taken a number of unprecedented actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe federal bank regulatory agencies have issued a steady stream of guidance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and have taken a number of unprecedented steps to help banks navigate the pandemic and mitigate its impact. These include, without limitation:\n\u25cf requiring banks to focus on business continuity and pandemic planning;\n\u25cf adding pandemic scenarios to stress testing;\n\u25cf encouraging bank use of capital buffers and reserves in lending programs;\n\u25cf permitting certain regulatory reporting extensions;\n\u25cf reducing margin requirements on swaps;\n\u25cf permitting certain otherwise prohibited investments in investment funds;\n\u25cf issuing guidance to encourage banks to work with customers affected by the pandemic and encourage loan workouts; and\n\u25cf providing credit under the CRA for certain pandemic-related loans, investments and public service.\nThe full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business activities as a result of new government and regulatory laws, policies, programs and guidelines, as well as market reactions to such activities, remains uncertain but may ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCOVID-19 has disrupted banking and other financial activities in the areas in which we operate and could potentially create widespread business continuity issues for us.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the ability of our employees and clients to engage in banking and other financial transactions in the geographic area in which we operate and could create widespread business continuity issues for us. We also could be adversely affected if key personnel or a significant number of employees were to become unavailable due to the effects and restrictions of an outbreak or escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic in our market area, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, there is no assurance that such plans and safeguards will be effective. Further, we rely upon our third-party vendors to conduct business and to process, record, and monitor transactions. If any of these vendors are unable to continue to provide us with these services, it could negatively impact our ability to serve our clients.\nAs a participating lender in the PPP, the Company and the subsidiary banks are subject to additional risks of litigation from our customers or other parties regarding our processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nSince the opening of the PPP, several larger banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP and claims related to agent fees. The Company and the subsidiary banks may be exposed to the risk of similar litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached the banks regarding PPP loans, regarding their process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. If any such litigation is filed against the Company or the subsidiary banks and is not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company or the banks, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe subsidiary banks also have credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the banks, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Company, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Company.\nEconomic and Market Risks\nConditions in the financial market and economic conditions, including conditions in the markets in which we operate, generally may adversely affect our business.\nWe operate primarily in the Quad Cities, Cedar Rapids, Waterloo/Cedar Falls, Des Moines/Ankeny, Iowa and Springfield, Missouri markets. Our general financial performance is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate and in particular, the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services it offers. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity\nor investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters, pandemics or a combination of these or other factors.\nUncertainty regarding economic conditions may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and savings habits. Downturns in the markets where our banking operations occur could result in a decrease in demand for our products and services, an increase in loan delinquencies and defaults, high or increased levels of problem assets and foreclosures and reduced wealth management fees resulting from lower asset values. Such conditions could adversely affect the credit quality of our loans, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterest rates and other conditions impact our results of operations.\nOur profitability is in large part a function of the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans/leases and the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities. Like most banking institutions, our net interest spread and margin will be affected by general economic conditions and other factors, including fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government that influence market interest rates and our ability to respond to changes in such rates. At any given time, our assets and liabilities will be such that they are affected differently by a given change in interest rates. As a result, an increase or decrease in rates, the length of loan/lease terms, and the mix of adjustable and fixed rate loans/leases in our portfolio, the length of time deposits and borrowings and the rate sensitivity of our deposit customers could have a positive or negative effect on our net income, capital and liquidity. We measure interest rate risk under various rate scenarios using specific criteria and assumptions. A summary of this process, along with the results of our net interest income simulations is presented at \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" included under Item 7A of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although we believe our current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable and effectively managed, significant fluctuations in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nIn March 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds rate and announced a $700 billion quantitative easing program in response to the expected economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the Federal Reserve reduced the interest it pays on excess reserves. The reductions in interest rates, especially if prolonged, is likely to continue to have an adverse effect our net interest income and margins and our profitability. In December 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee held the target rate at its effective floor of 0.00-0.25% with panelists projecting the target rate to remain at these levels through 2021 and potentially 2022. There is potential that the rate cuts could pose additional risks to the economy primarily through higher inflation and financial-stability concerns driven by low borrowing costs. There is a possibility that labor markets could tighten causing inflationary pressures to build faster than the expected gradual pace. There is additional risk that persistently low interest rates could lead consumers and firms to take on riskier financial investments in search of better returns, increasing asset prices to unsustainable levels. The potential rise in asset prices to unsustainable levels could pose potential financial-stability risks in the commercial real estate and corporate borrowing sectors. Sustained low interest rate periods were something that preceded the 1990 and 2007 recessions, placing significant pressure on real estate asset prices through reach-for-yield investor behavior.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nDeclines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely affect the value of our investments, financial performance and capital.\nThe market value of investments in our securities portfolio has become increasingly volatile in recent years, and as of December 31, 2020, we had gross unrealized losses of $772 thousand, or 0.9% of amortized cost, in our investment\nportfolio (offset by gross unrealized gains of $57.8 million). The market value of investments may be affected by factors other than the underlying performance of the servicer of the securities or the mortgages underlying the securities, such as ratings downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities. On a quarterly basis, we formally evaluate investments and other assets for impairment indicators. We may be required to record additional impairment charges if our investments suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-temporary. If we determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we would be required to charge against earnings the credit-related portion of the OTTI, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods in which the write-offs occur. Based on management's evaluation, it was determined that the gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2020 were temporary and primarily a function of the changes in certain market interest rates.\nThe stock market can be volatile, and fluctuations in our operating results and other factors could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe stock market has experienced, and may continue to experience, fluctuations that significantly impact the market prices of securities issued by many companies. Market fluctuations could also adversely affect our stock price. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, loss of investor confidence, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Moreover, our operating results may fluctuate and vary from period to period due to the risk factors set forth herein. As a result, period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our stock price could fluctuate significantly in response to our quarterly or annual results and the impact of these risk factors on our operating results or financial position.\nSecondary mortgage, government guaranteed loan and interest rate swap market conditions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrently, we sell a portion of the residential real estate and government guaranteed loans we originate. The profitability of these operations depends in large part upon our ability to make loans and to sell them in the secondary market at a gain. Thus, we are dependent upon the existence of an active secondary market and our ability to profitably sell loans into that market.\nIn addition to being affected by interest rates, the secondary markets are also subject to investor demand for residential mortgages and government guaranteed loans and investor yield requirements for those loans. These conditions may fluctuate or even worsen in the future. As a result, a prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity may reduce our loan production volumes and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe interest rate swap market is dependent upon market conditions. If interest rates move, interest rate swap transactions may no longer make sense for the Company and/or its customers. Interest rate swaps are generally appropriate for commercial customers with a certain level of expertise and comfort with derivatives, so our success is dependent upon the ability to make loans to these types of commercial customers. Additionally, our ability to execute interest rate swaps is also dependent upon counterparties that are willing to enter into the interest rate swap that is equal and offsetting to the interest rate swap we enter into with the commercial customer.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nWe may be materially and adversely affected by the highly regulated environment in which we operate.\nThe Company and its bank subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, supervision and examination. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors' funds, FDIC funds, customers and the banking system as a whole, rather than stockholders. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things.\nAs a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation and supervision primarily by the Federal Reserve. QCBT, CRBT and CSB, as Iowa-chartered state member banks, are subject to regulation and supervision primarily by both the Iowa Superintendent and the Federal Reserve. SFCB, as a Missouri-chartered commercial bank, is subject to regulation by both the Missouri Division of Finance and the Federal Reserve. We and our banks undergo periodic examinations by these regulators, who have extensive discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks and bank holding companies. The primary federal and state banking laws and regulations that affect us are\ndescribed in Appendix A \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d to this report. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time.\nU.S. financial institutions are also subject to numerous monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements designed to detect and prevent illegal activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing. These requirements are imposed primarily through the Bank Secrecy Act which was most recently amended by the USA Patriot Act. We have instituted policies and procedures to protect us and our employees, to the extent reasonably possible, from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes. There can be no guarantee, however, that these policies and procedures are effective.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil monetary penalties, and/or damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Although we have policies and procedures designed to mitigate the risk of any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur.\nFuture legislation, regulation, and government policy could affect the banking industry as a whole, including our business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In addition, our results of operations also could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.\nWe are required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to losses, an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance, would be adversely affected.\nThe Company and each of its banking subsidiaries are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their operations, which have recently increased due to the effectiveness of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms. We intend to grow our business organically and to explore opportunities to grow our business by taking advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities, and such growth plans may require us to raise additional capital to ensure that we have adequate levels of capital to support such growth on top of our current operations. Our ability to raise additional capital, when and if needed or desired, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry and market conditions, and governmental activities, many of which are outside our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. Our failure to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements could affect customer confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on common and preferred stock and to make distributions on our trust preferred securities, our ability to make acquisitions, and our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may result in operational changes and expenditures that could significantly impact our business.\nThe current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. In recent years, governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures, in part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change. Consumers and businesses may also change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. Our efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions, including by increasing our business with climate-friendly companies, may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior.\nGiven the lack of empirical data on the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change, it is difficult to predict how climate change may impact our financial condition and operations; however, as a banking organization, the physical effects of climate change may present certain unique risks. For example, weather disasters, shifts in local climates and other disruptions related to climate change may adversely affect the value of real properties securing our loans, which could diminish the value of our loan portfolio. Such events may also cause reductions in regional and local economic\nactivity that may have an adverse effect on our customers, which could limit our ability to raise and invest capital in these areas and communities.\nEvolving law impacting cannabis-related businesses in Illinois may have an impact on the Company's operations and risk profile.\nThe Controlled Substances Act makes it illegal under federal law to manufacture, distribute, or dispense marijuana. Starting January 1, 2020, however, the Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act began permitting adults to legally purchase marijuana for recreational use from licensed dispensaries. It is the Banks' current policy to avoid knowingly providing banking products or services to entities or individuals that: (i) directly or indirectly manufacture, distribute, or dispense marijuana or hemp products, or those who have a significant financial interest in such entities; and (ii) derive a significant percentage of revenue from providing products or services to, or other involvement with, such entities. The Banks are taking reasonable measures, including appropriate new account screening and customer due diligence measures, to ensure that existing and potential customers do not engage in any such activities. Nonetheless, the shift in Illinois law is increasing the number of direct and indirect cannabis-related businesses in Illinois, and therefore increasing the likelihood that the Banks could interact with such businesses, as well as their owners and employees. Such interactions could create additional legal, regulatory, strategic, and reputational risk to the Banks and the Company.\nCredit and Lending Risks\nWe must effectively manage our credit risk.\nThere are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks inherent in dealing with specific borrowers, risks of nonpayment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions. We attempt to minimize our credit risk through prudent loan application approval procedures, careful monitoring of the concentration of our loans within specific industries and periodic independent reviews of outstanding loans by our credit review department and an external third party. However, we cannot assure you that such approval and monitoring procedures will reduce these credit risks.\nThe majority of our subsidiary banks' loan portfolios are invested in C&I and CRE loans, and we focus on lending to small to medium-sized businesses. The size of the loans we can offer to commercial customers is less than the size of the loans that our competitors with larger lending limits can offer. This may limit our ability to establish relationships with the area's largest businesses. Smaller companies tend to be at a competitive disadvantage and generally have limited operating histories, less sophisticated internal record keeping and financial planning capabilities and fewer financial resources than larger companies. As a result, we may assume greater lending risks than financial institutions that have a lesser concentration of such loans and tend to make loans to larger, more established businesses. Collateral for these loans generally includes accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and real estate. However, depending on the overall financial condition of the borrower, some loans are made on an unsecured basis. In addition to C&I and CRE loans, our subsidiary banks are also active in residential mortgage and consumer lending. Our borrowers may experience financial difficulties, and the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise, which could negatively impact our business through increased provision, reduced interest income on loans/leases, and increased expenses incurred to carry and resolve problem loans/leases.\nC&I loans make up a large portion of our loan/lease portfolio.\nC&I loans were $1.7 billion, or approximately 41% of our total loan/lease portfolio, as of December 31, 2020. Our C&I loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most often, this collateral is accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and real estate. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation value of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any exists. Whenever possible, we require a personal guarantee or cosigner on commercial loans. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing these loans may lose value over time, may be difficult to appraise, and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. In addition, a prolonged recovery period could harm or continue to harm the businesses of our C&I customers and reduce the value of the collateral securing these loans.\nOur loan/lease portfolio has a significant concentration of CRE loans, which involve risks specific to real estate values.\nCRE lending comprises a significant portion of our lending business. Specifically, CRE loans were $2.1 billion, or approximately 50% of our total loan/lease portfolio, as of December 31, 2020. Of this amount, $496.5 million, or approximately 24%, was owner-occupied. The market value of real estate securing our CRE loans can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located. Adverse developments affecting real estate values in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio. Additionally, real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of the loans generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic events or governmental regulations outside of the control of the borrower or lender could negatively impact the future cash flow and market values of the affected properties.\nCapital and Liquidity Risks\nLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of securities and/or loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our primary sources of funds consist of cash from operations, deposits, investment maturities, repayments, and calls, and loan/lease repayments. Additional liquidity is provided by federal funds purchased from the FRB or other correspondent banks, FHLB advances, wholesale and customer repurchase agreements, brokered deposits, and the ability to borrow at the FRB's Discount Window. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nDuring periods of economic turmoil, the financial services industry and the credit markets generally may be materially and adversely affected by significant declines in asset values and depressed levels of liquidity. Furthermore, regional and community banks generally have less access to the capital markets than do the national and super-regional banks because of their smaller size and limited analyst coverage. Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans/leases, invest in securities, meet our expenses, pay dividends to our stockholders, or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a bank holding company, our sources of funds are limited.\nWe are a bank holding company, and our operations are primarily conducted by our subsidiary banks, which are subject to significant federal and state regulation. When available, cash to pay dividends to our stockholders is derived primarily from dividends received from our subsidiary banks. Our ability to receive dividends or loans from our subsidiary banks is restricted. Dividend payments by our subsidiaries to us in the future will require generation of future earnings by them and could require regulatory approval if any proposed dividends are in excess of prescribed guidelines. Further, as a structural matter, our right to participate in the assets of our subsidiary banks in the event of a liquidation or reorganization of any of the banks would be subject to the claims of the creditors of such bank, including depositors, which would take priority except to the extent we may be a creditor with a recognized claim. As of December 31, 2020, our subsidiary banks had deposits, borrowings and other liabilities in the aggregate of approximately $5.2 billion.\nOur allowance may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan/lease portfolio.\nWe establish our allowance for loan and lease losses in consultation with management of our subsidiaries and maintain it at a level considered adequate by management to absorb loan/lease losses that are inherent in the portfolio. The amount of future loan/lease losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, which may be beyond our control, and such losses may exceed current estimates. At December 31, 2020, our allowance as a percentage of total gross loans/leases was 1.98%, and as a percentage of total NPLs was 574.61%. In accordance with GAAP for acquisition accounting, the loans acquired through the acquisitions of SFCB, Guaranty Bank and CSB were recorded at fair value; therefore, there was no allowance associated with SFCB's, Guaranty Bank's and CSB's loans at acquisition. Management continues to evaluate the allowance needed on the acquired loans factoring in the net remaining discount ($3.1 million at December 31, 2020).\nIn addition, we had net charge-offs as a percentage of gross average loans/leases of 0.18% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Because of the concentration of C&I and CRE loans in our loan portfolio, which tend to be larger in amount than residential real estate and installment loans, the movement of a small number of loans to nonperforming status can have a significant impact on these ratios. Although management believes that the allowance as of December 31, 2020 was adequate to absorb losses on any existing loans/leases that may become uncollectible, we cannot predict loan/lease losses with certainty, and we cannot assure you that our allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual loan/lease losses in the future, particularly if economic conditions are more difficult than what management currently expects. Additional provisions and loan/lease losses in excess of our allowance may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetitive and Strategic Risks\nWe face intense competition in all phases of our business from other banks and financial institutions.\nThe banking and financial services businesses in our markets are highly competitive. Our competitors include large regional banks, local community banks, savings and loan associations, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, Fintech companies, money market mutual funds, credit unions, online lenders and other non-bank financial services providers. Many of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as we are. Many of our unregulated competitors compete across geographic boundaries and are able to provide customers with a feasible alternative to traditional banking services.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing consumers and businesses to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods. For example, the wide acceptance of Internet-based commerce has resulted in a number of alternative payment processing systems and lending platforms in which banks play only minor roles. Customers can now maintain funds in prepaid debit cards or digital currencies, and pay bills and transfer funds directly without the direct assistance of banks.\nIncreased competition in our markets may result in a decrease in the amounts of our loans and deposits, reduced spreads between loan/lease rates and deposit rates or loan/lease terms that are more favorable to the borrower. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and remain profitable. If increased competition causes us to significantly discount the interest rates we offer on loans or increase the amount we pay on deposits, our net interest income could be adversely impacted. If increased competition causes us to modify our underwriting standards, we could be exposed to higher losses from lending and leasing activities. Additionally, many of our competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets, have larger lending limits and offer a broader range of financial services than we can offer.\nPotential future acquisitions could be difficult to integrate, divert the attention of key personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our financial results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may consider acquisitions of other banks or financial institutions or branches, assets or deposits of such organizations. There is no assurance, however, that we will determine to pursue any of these opportunities or that if we determine to pursue them that we will be successful. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n\u25cf difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products, existing contracts, accounting processes and personnel of the target company and realizing the anticipated synergies of the combined businesses;\n\u25cf difficulties in supporting and transitioning customers of the target company;\n\u25cf diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;\n\u25cf the price we pay or other resources that we devote may exceed the value we realize, or the value we could have realized if we had allocated the purchase price or other resources to another opportunity;\n\u25cf risks of entering new markets or areas in which we have limited or no experience or are outside our core competencies;\n\u25cf potential loss of key employees, customers and strategic alliances from either our current business or the business of the target company;\n\u25cf risks of acquiring loans with deteriorated credit quality;\n\u25cf assumption of unanticipated problems or latent liabilities; and\n\u25cf inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs.\nFuture acquisitions may involve the issuance of our equity securities as payment or in connection with financing the business or assets acquired, and as a result, could dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. In addition, consummating these transactions could result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense, as well as unforeseen liabilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The failure to successfully evaluate and execute acquisitions or otherwise adequately address the risks associated with acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may seek to implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business in our current markets or new markets. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible, which could in turn have a material negative effect on our operating results.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research reports about us, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock can be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If there is limited or no securities or industry analyst coverage of us, the market price for our stock could be negatively impacted. Moreover, if any of the analysts who elect to cover us downgrade our common stock, provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors or if our operating results or prospects do not meet their expectations, the market price of our common stock may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nOur reputation could be damaged by negative publicity.\nReputational risk, or the risk to our business, financial condition or results of operations from negative publicity, is inherent in our business. Negative publicity can result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, inadequate protection of customer data, ethical behavior of our employees, and from actions taken by regulators, ratings agencies and others as a result of that conduct. Damage to our reputation could impact our ability to attract new or maintain existing loan and deposit customers, employees and business relationships.\nAccounting and Tax Risks\nThe FASB has issued an accounting standard update that will result in a significant change in how the Company recognizes credit losses and may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update, \"Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\" which replaced the current \"incurred loss\" model for recognizing credit losses with an \"expected loss\" model referred to as the CECL model. Under the CECL model, the Company will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity investment securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based\non information from past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset initially recorded on the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \"incurred loss\" model required under current GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. The CECL model may create more volatility in the level of the allowance for loan losses.\nThe new CECL standard became effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act, a stimulus package designed in response to the economic disruption created by COVID-19, was signed into law. The CARES Act includes provisions that, if elected, temporarily delay the required implementation date of ASU 2016-13. Section 4014 of the CARES Act stipulates that no insured depository institution, bank holding company, or affiliate will be required to comply with ASU 2016-13, beginning on the date of the enactment, March 27, 2020 until the earlier of the two following dates: (1) the date on which the national emergency related to the COVID-19 outbreak is terminated or (2) December 31, 2020. The Company elected to defer its implementation of ASU 2016-13 as allowed by the CARES Act. On December 27, 2020, former President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which extended this relief to the earlier of the first day of the Company\u2019s fiscal year after the date of the national emergency terminates or January 1, 2022. The Company anticipates recognizing a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings and our allowance for loan losses as of January 1, 2021, as allowed by guidance in 2020. The Company incurred transition costs and expects to incur ongoing costs in maintaining the additional CECL models and methodology, including acquiring forecasts used within the models, which will result in increased capital costs upon initial adoption and over time. The Company estimates an increase in the allowance for estimated losses on loans/leases in the range of $1 million to $3 million upon adoption of CECL at January 1, 2021. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d for additional information on the Company\u2019s impact of adopting CECL.\nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments, which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and which may differ from actual results.\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and general reporting practices within the financial services industry, which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Some accounting policies, such as those pertaining to our allowance, require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in subsequent periods.\nFrom time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nThe transition to an alternative reference rate could cause instability and have a negative effect on financial market conditions.\nLIBOR represents the interest rate at which banks offer to lend funds to one another in the international interbank market for short-term loans. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR rates after 2021 (the \"July 27th Announcement\"). The July 27th Announcement indicated that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021, and on November 30, 2020 the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC issued supervisory guidance encouraging banks to cease entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to U.S. dollar-LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR. The ARRC has proposed a paced-market transition plan to SOFR from U.S. dollar-LIBOR and organizations are working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans relating to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR.\nAt this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether SOFR or another rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR or the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives on the value of LIBOR-linked securities.\nAlthough the Financial Stability Oversight Council has recommended a transition to an alternative reference rate in the event LIBOR is no longer available after 2021, such plans are still in development and, if enacted, could present challenges. Moreover, contracts linked to LIBOR are vast in number and value, are intertwined with numerous financial products and services, and have diverse parties. The downstream effect of unwinding or transitioning such contracts could cause instability and negatively impact the financial markets and individual institutions. The uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of LIBOR more generally could undermine market integrity and threaten individual financial institutions and the U.S. financial system more broadly.\nThe Company's information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security and cyber-attacks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.\nThe Company relies heavily on internal and outsourced technologies, communications, and information systems to conduct its business. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Company collects, processes and retains sensitive and confidential information regarding our customers. As the Company's reliance on technology has increased, so have the potential risks of a technology-related operation interruption (such as disruptions in the Company's customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, or other systems) or the occurrence of a cyber-attacks (such as unauthorized access to the Company's systems). These risks have increased for all financial institutions as new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others have also increased. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers have engaged in attacks against financial institutions, retailers and government agencies, particularly denial of service attacks that are designed to disrupt key business or government services, such as customer-facing web sites. The Company is not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. It is also possible that a cyber incident, such as a security breach, may remain undetected for a period of time, further exposing the Company to technology-related risks.\nThe Company also faces risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card and debit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding the Company's customers through various third parties, including merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, payment card networks and its processors. Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks, and because the transactions involve third parties and environments such as the point of sale that the Company does not control or secure, future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third parties could impact the Company through no fault of its own, and in some cases it may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them. Further cyber-attacks or other breaches in the future, whether affecting the Company or others, could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in increased costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. To the extent we are involved in any future cyber-attacks or other breaches, the Company's reputation could be affected, which could also have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSystem failure or breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Computer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, as well as that of our customers engaging in internet banking activities, which may result in significant liability to us and may cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us. Although we, with the help of third-party service providers, intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage, there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful. In addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third-party service providers use to\nencrypt and protect customer transaction data. Any interruption in, or breach of security of, our computer systems and network infrastructure, or that of our internet banking customers, could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The Company may also need to spend additional resources to enhance protective and detective measures or to conduct investigations to remediate any vulnerabilities that arise.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee misconduct or fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\nEmployee errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. Despite having business continuity plans and other safeguards, the Company could still be affected. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, and if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our SBA lending program is dependent upon the continued availability of SBA loan programs, our status as a preferred lender under the SBA loan programs and our ability to comply with applicable SBA lending requirements.\nAs an SBA Preferred Lender, we enable our clients to obtain SBA loans without being subject to the potentially lengthy SBA approval process necessary for lenders that are not SBA Preferred Lenders. The SBA periodically reviews the lending operations of participating lenders to assess, among other things, whether the lender exhibits prudent risk management. When weaknesses are identified, the SBA may request corrective actions or impose other restrictions, including revocation of the lender's SBA Preferred Lender status. If we lose our status as an SBA Preferred Lender, we may lose our ability to compete effectively with other SBA Preferred Lenders, and as a result we would experience a material adverse effect to our financial results. Any changes to the SBA program, including changes to the level of guaranty provided by the federal government on SBA loans or changes to the level of funds appropriated by the federal government to the various SBA programs, may also have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nHistorically we have sold the guaranteed portion of our SBA loans in the secondary market. These sales have resulted in our earning premium income and/or have created a stream of future servicing income. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue originating these loans, that a secondary market will exist or that we will continue to realize premiums upon the sale of the guaranteed portion of these loans. When we sell the guaranteed portion of our SBA loans, we incur credit risk on the retained, non-guaranteed portion of the loans.\nIn the event of a loss resulting from default and the SBA determines there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded or serviced by the us, the SBA may require us to repurchase the loan, deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of the principal loss related to the deficiency from us, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur community banking strategy relies heavily on our subsidiaries' independent management teams, and the unexpected loss of key managers may adversely affect our operations.\nWe rely heavily on the success of our bank subsidiaries' independent management teams. Accordingly, much of our success to date has been influenced strongly by our ability to attract and to retain senior management experienced in banking and financial services and familiar with the communities in our market areas. Our ability to retain the executive officers and current management teams of our operating subsidiaries will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategy. It is also critical, as we manage our existing portfolio and grow, to be able to attract and retain qualified additional management and loan officers with the appropriate level of experience and knowledge about our market areas to implement our community-based operating strategy. The unexpected loss of services of any key management personnel,\nor the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nWe have a continuing need for technological change, and we may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology.\nThe financial services industry continues to undergo rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to enabling us to better serve our customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and the potential for cost reduction. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow our market share. Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior products to those that we will be able to offer, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, we cannot provide you with assurance that we will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our customers.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt outstanding and may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could restrict our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $151.7 million of total indebtedness outstanding at the holding company level. In the future, it is possible that we may not generate sufficient revenues to service or repay our debt, and have sufficient funds left over to achieve or sustain profitability in our operations, meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs, and to pay dividends to our common stockholders. Moreover, the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences for our stockholders, including:\n\u25cf limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf making it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt and other obligations;\n\u25cf limiting our ability to borrow additional funds, or to sell assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u25cf increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates; and\n\u25cf placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, pandemic, acts of terrorism or war or other adverse external events could significantly impact the Company's business.\nAs the Company's operating and market footprint continues to grow, severe weather, natural disasters, pandemic, acts of terrorism or war and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company's ability to conduct business. The Company's current footprint poses a wide variety of potential weather, natural disaster, or other adverse events that could impact the Company in various ways. In addition, such events could affect the stability of the Company's deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operation.", "PERMNO": 79731, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "QCRH"}
