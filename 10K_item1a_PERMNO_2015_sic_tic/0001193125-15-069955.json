{"cik": "1364742", "company": "BlackRock Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAs a leading investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRock\u2019s business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market, operating and compliance risks, BlackRock\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the Company\u2019s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties, including the ones discussed below.\nMARKET AND COMPETITION RISKS\nChanges in the value levels of equity, debt, real estate, commodities, currency or other asset markets could cause assets under management (\u201cAUM\u201d), revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock\u2019s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real estate, commodities or alternative investments in which BlackRock invests, could cause:\n\u2022\nthe value of AUM, or the returns BlackRock realizes on AUM, to decrease;\n\u2022\nthe withdrawal of funds from BlackRock\u2019s products in favor of products offered by competitors;\n\u2022\nthe rebalancing of assets into BlackRock products that yield lower fees;\n\u2022\nan impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or\n\u2022\na decrease in the value of seed or co-investment capital.\nThe occurrence of any of these events may cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock\u2019s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.\nBlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from its investment advisory business. The advisory or management contracts BlackRock has entered into with its clients, including the agreements that govern many of BlackRock\u2019s investment funds, provide investors or, in some cases, the independent directors of private investment funds, with significant latitude to terminate such contracts, withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty, or to remove BlackRock as the funds\u2019 investment advisor (or equivalent). BlackRock also manages its U.S. mutual funds, closed-end and exchange-traded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds\u2019 respective boards of directors, a majority of whom are independent from the Company. If a number of BlackRock\u2019s clients terminate their contracts, remove BlackRock from advisory roles, liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on favorable terms, the fees or carried interest BlackRock earns could be reduced, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nIncreased competition may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nThe investment management industry is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. BlackRock competes based on a number of factors including: investment performance, the level of fees charged, the quality and diversity of services and products provided, name recognition and reputation, and the ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. Increased competition on the basis of any of these factors, including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or future new business, could cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nThe impairment or failure of other financial institutions may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock\u2019s investment management activities expose the products and accounts it manages to many different industries and counterparties, including brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Transactions with counterparties expose the products and accounts BlackRock manages to credit risk in the event the applicable counterparty defaults. Although BlackRock regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties, such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may otherwise fail to meet their obligations to BlackRock. Any such impairment or failure could negatively impact the performance of products or accounts managed by BlackRock, which could lead to the loss of clients and may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nThe failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause AUM in similar BlackRock products to decline irrespective of BlackRock\u2019s performance.\nMany competitors offer similar products to those offered by BlackRock and the failure or negative performance of competitors\u2019 products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar BlackRock products, irrespective of the performance\nof such products. Any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products, which may cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nChanges in the value of seed and co-investments that BlackRock owns could affect our nonoperating income and could increase the volatility of our earnings.\nAt December 31, 2014, BlackRock\u2019s net economic investment exposure of approximately $1.3 billion in its investments (see \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Investments\u201d) primarily resulted from co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. Movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real estate, commodities or alternative investments, could lower the value of these investments, increase the volatility of BlackRock\u2019s earnings and may cause earnings to decline.\nRISKS RELATED TO INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE\nPoor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nThe Company\u2019s management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks or to competitors could cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline as a result of:\n\u2022\nclient withdrawals in favor of better performing products;\n\u2022\nthe diminishing ability to attract additional funds from existing and new clients;\n\u2022\nthe Company earning minimal or no performance fees;\n\u2022\nan impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or\n\u2022\na decrease in investment returns on seed and co-investment capital.\nPerformance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings.\nA portion of BlackRock\u2019s revenue is derived from performance fees on investment and risk management advisory assignments. Performance fees represented $550 million, or 5%, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. Generally, the Company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement pursuant to which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, a performance fee for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods, which could cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nFailure to identify errors in the quantitative models BlackRock utilizes to manage its business could adversely impact product performance and client relationships.\nBlackRock employs various quantitative models to support its investment decisions and allocations, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading\nand hedging activities and product valuations. Any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on BlackRock\u2019s business and reputation.\nTECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\nA failure in BlackRock\u2019s operational systems or infrastructure, including business continuity plans, could disrupt operations, damage the Company\u2019s reputation and may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock\u2019s infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers, and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. Moreover a significant portion of BlackRock\u2019s critical business operations are concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas, including San Francisco, New York, London and Gurgaon. The failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of BlackRock\u2019s business, or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside BlackRock\u2019s control, including a major earthquake, hurricane, fire, terrorist act, pandemic or other catastrophic event in any location at which BlackRock maintains a major presence, could materially impact operations, result in disruption to the business or impede its growth. Notwithstanding BlackRock\u2019s efforts to ensure business continuity, if it fails to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans, including secure back-up facilities and systems and the availability of back-up employees, are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption, the Company\u2019s ability to operate could be adversely impacted which could cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline or could impact the Company\u2019s ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm, regulatory fines and sanctions.\nFailure to implement effective information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them. An externally caused information security incident, such as a hacker attack, virus or worm, or an internally caused issue, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information and could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory actions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, could cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nFailure to maintain Aladdin\u2019s competitive position in a dynamic market for risk analytics could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock\u2019s productivity and growth.\nThe sophisticated risk analytics that BlackRock provides via the Aladdin technology platform to support investment advisory and BRS clients are a key element to BlackRock\u2019s competitive success. BlackRock relies on its ability, as well as the ability of a number of third parties who provide it with various types of data and software, to maintain a robust and\nsecure technological framework to maximize the benefit of the Aladdin platform. The failure of these third parties to provide such data or software could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact BlackRock\u2019s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and BRS clients. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to deliver a competitive product in a dynamic market for risk analytics or be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in these systems and processes.\nOperating risks associated with BlackRock\u2019s securities lending program may result in client losses, and in certain circumstances, potential financial liabilities for the Company.\nBlackRock lends securities to banks and broker-dealers on behalf of certain of its clients. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock must manage this process and is charged with mitigating the associated operational risks. The failure of the Company\u2019s controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the Company\u2019s clients that participate in its securities lending programs (separate from the risks of collateral investments). Additionally, in certain circumstances, the Company could potentially be held liable for the failure to manage any such risks.\nBlackRock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default.\nBlackRock indemnifies certain of its securities lending clients for specified losses that might occur upon the default of a borrower. These indemnities are designed to cover a client\u2019s potential shortfall where the value of the collateral pledged by a defaulting borrower in connection with a securities lending agreement is less than the amount needed to repurchase the securities loaned to such a defaulting borrower. Where the collateral is in the form of cash, the indemnities BlackRock provides do not guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2014 and subject to indemnification was $145.7 billion. BlackRock held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $155.8 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2014. Significant borrower defaults coupled with collateral shortfalls could result in material liabilities under these indemnities, which may cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock\u2019s decision to provide support to particular products from time to time, or the inability to provide support, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock may, at its option, from time to time support investment products through capital or other credit support. Such support may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. Losses on such support, as well as regulatory restrictions on our ability to provide such support or the failure to have available or devote sufficient capital or liquidity to support products, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nFailure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, as well as harm its prospects for growth.\nBlackRock\u2019s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors, including its ability to maintain and grow AUM, its creditworthiness and operating cash flows. Failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force BlackRock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives. BlackRock\u2019s access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt, or secure lines of credit or commercial paper back-up lines, on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, a reduction in its long- or short-term credit ratings as well as changes in government regulations, including tax and interest rates. Failure to obtain funds and/or financing, or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds and/or financing, could cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth.\nFraud, or the circumvention of controls and risk management policies, could have an adverse effect on BlackRock\u2019s reputation, which may cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nAlthough BlackRock has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks, it cannot assure that such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to its businesses. BlackRock is subject to the risk that its employees, contractors or other third parties may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud or act in ways that are inconsistent with the Company\u2019s controls, policies and procedures. Persistent or repeated attempts involving fraud, conflicts of interests or circumvention of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on BlackRock\u2019s reputation, which could cause costly regulatory inquiries and may cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose BlackRock to additional costs or operational risk.\nBlackRock\u2019s financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to develop, market and manage new investment products and services. The development and introduction of new products and services requires continued innovative efforts on the part of BlackRock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements. A failure to continue to innovate to introduce new products and services or to successfully manage the risks associated with such products and services may cause BlackRock\u2019s costs to fluctuate, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nThe failure to recruit and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock\u2019s success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the Company\u2019s ability to plan for the future long-term growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within BlackRock. The market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, financial advisers and other professionals is competitive, and factors that affect BlackRock\u2019s ability to attract and retain such employees include the Company\u2019s reputation, the compensation and benefits it provides, and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession, including the development and training of qualified individuals. In addition, a percentage of the deferred compensation that BlackRock pays to its employees is tied to the Company\u2019s share price. As such, if BlackRock\u2019s share price were to decrease materially, the retention value of such deferred compensation would decrease. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession. If BlackRock is unable to attract and retain talented individuals, or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession, the Company\u2019s ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted.\nFuture inorganic transactions may harm the Company\u2019s competitive or financial position if they are not successful.\nBlackRock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings, increase product offerings, access new clients and expand into new geographies. Inorganic strategies have included hiring smaller-sized investment teams, and acquiring investment management businesses and other small and medium-sized companies. Inorganic transactions involve a number of financial, accounting, tax, regulatory and operational challenges and uncertainties, including in some cases the assumption of pre-existing liabilities. Any failure to identify and mitigate these risks through due diligence and indemnification provisions could adversely impact BlackRock\u2019s reputation, may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, and may harm the Company\u2019s competitive position in the investment management industry. Moreover, there can be no assurances that BlackRock will be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from future inorganic transactions.\nOperating in international markets increases BlackRock\u2019s operational, regulatory and other risks.\nAs a result of BlackRock\u2019s extensive international operations, the Company faces associated operational, regulatory, reputational, political and foreign exchange rate risks, many of which are outside of the Company\u2019s control. The failure of the Company\u2019s systems of internal control to mitigate such risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions, which could cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nRISKS RELATED TO BLACKROCK\u2019S KEY VENDOR AND DISTRIBUTION RELATIONSHIPS\nThe failure of a key vendor to BlackRock to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock\u2019s reputation or business, which may cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, accounting, custody, risk analytics, market data, market indices and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendor to fulfill its obligations could lead to operational and regulatory issues for the Company, including with respect to certain of its products, which could result in reputational harm and may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nAny disruption to the Company\u2019s distribution channels may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels. In particular, BlackRock entered into a global distribution agreement with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch in 2006, which is subject to renegotiation at the end of 2016. BlackRock\u2019s ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors is material to the Company\u2019s future performance. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully, if it experiences an increase in distribution-related costs, or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangements, BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings may decline.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nBlackRock is subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the world.\nBlackRock\u2019s business is subject to extensive regulation around the world. These regulations subject BlackRock\u2019s business activities to a pervasive array of increasingly detailed operational requirements, compliance with which is costly, time-consuming and complex. BlackRock may be adversely affected by its failure to comply with current laws and regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations. Challenges associated with interpreting regulations issued in numerous countries in a globally consistent manner may add to such risks, if regulators in different jurisdictions have inconsistent views or provide only limited regulatory guidance. In particular, violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, temporary or permanent prohibition of certain activities, reputational harm and related client terminations, suspensions of employees or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser, broker-dealer or other registrations, or suspension or termination of bank charter or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock\u2019s reputation or business and may cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. For a more extensive discussion of the laws, regulations and regulators to which BlackRock is subject, see \u201cItem 1 - Business - Regulation.\u201d\nRegulatory reforms in the United States and internationally expose BlackRock and its clients to increasing regulatory scrutiny.\nIn recent years a number of proposals for regulatory reform have been introduced and it is expected that the level of\nregulatory scrutiny to which BlackRock is subject will continue to increase. See \u201cItem 1 - Business - Regulation.\u201d A number of regulatory reforms that have been proposed may require BlackRock to alter its business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly and which may impede the Company\u2019s growth and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock\u2019s banking, insurance company and pension fund clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock. Key regulatory reforms that may impact the Company include:\n\u2022\nDesignation as a systemically important financial institution: Under the DFA, the Federal Reserve is charged with establishing enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions which have been designated as \u201csystemically important\u201d by the FSOC. In addition, the FSB and IOSCO have issued a consultative document on proposed methodologies to identify nonbank/noninsurance G-SIFIs. Although BlackRock has not been designated as a SIFI or G-SIFI, if it is designated as such in the future, it is likely to become subject to enhanced prudential, capital, supervisory and other requirements. Requirements such as these, which were designed to regulate banking institutions, would need to be modified to be applicable to an asset manager such as BlackRock. No proposals have been made indicating how such measures would be adapted for asset managers.\n\u2022\nThe Volcker Rule: Provisions of the DFA referred to as the \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d created a new section of the BHC Act that places limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds, including hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds (collectively \u201ccovered funds\u201d). Complying with the Volcker Rule may reduce the level of market making and liquidity activities of several of BlackRock\u2019s trading counterparties, which may adversely impact the liquidity and, in some cases, the pricing of various financial instruments in which BlackRock client accounts invest. Because the Federal Reserve currently treats BlackRock as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC, BlackRock may be required to conform its activities to the requirements of the Volcker Rule. On December 18, 2014, the Federal Reserve announced a second extension to the Volcker Rule conformance period, giving banking entities until July 21, 2016, to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds and foreign funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013 (\u201clegacy covered funds\u201d). The Federal Reserve also announced its intention to act in the future to grant banking entities an additional one-year extension of the conformance period until July 21, 2017, to conform ownership interests in and relationships with these legacy covered funds. The Volcker Rule\u2019s restrictions would, among other things, limit BlackRock\u2019s ability to invest in covered funds and require BlackRock to remove its name from the names of its covered funds. The Volcker Rule may also require BlackRock to sell certain seed and co-investments that it holds in covered funds, potentially at a discount to existing carrying value, depending on market conditions.\n\u2022\nMoney market mutual fund reform: Approximately 3% of BlackRock\u2019s AUM as of December 31, 2014, consisted of assets in U.S. money market funds, of which institutional prime or institutional municipal money market funds (including offshore funds that feed into such money market funds) comprised approximately 2%. In July 2014, the SEC adopted rule amendments designed to reform the regulatory structure governing money market funds and to address the perceived systemic risks that such funds present. The new rules require institutional prime and institutional municipal money market funds to employ a floating net asset value method of pricing, which allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of fund assets. The rules also provide for new tools for the funds\u2019 boards designed to address liquidity shocks, including liquidity fees and redemption gates. The rules do not apply to government (non-municipal) and retail money market funds, except that retail money market funds must comply with liquidity fees and redemption gate requirements. The potential impact of the rules that affect the structure of the funds, which have a two-year compliance period, on BlackRock\u2019s business remains untested; they may, however, reduce the attractiveness of certain money market funds to investors.\n\u2022\nRegulation of swaps and derivatives: The implementation of DFA regulations, similar regulations in the EU and other global jurisdictions relating to swaps and derivatives could impact the manner in which BlackRock-advised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives, increasing the costs of derivatives trading for BlackRock\u2019s clients. Various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds, accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require BlackRock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject. These rules will also introduce new central clearing requirements for certain swap transactions and will require that certain swaps be executed only on or through electronic trading venues (as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods), with which BlackRock will have to comply. The new rules and regulations may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and will increase the operational and legal risks with which BlackRock will have to contend.\n\u2022\nIncreased international regulatory scrutiny: In addition to the extensive scrutiny BlackRock faces from U.S.-based regulators, the Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to the authority of numerous governmental and regulatory bodies globally, in particular in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. These regulators have imposed numerous regulations, guidelines and standards on the activities of BlackRock and its subsidiaries covering a variety of areas, including capital resources requirements, marketing activities, client and investor protections, senior management arrangements and enhanced system and control requirements. In the event that BlackRock or any of its subsidiaries fails to comply with these often complex guidelines, regulations and standards, the regulators have broad powers to suspend or revoke any licenses they may have granted and/or to impose sanctions or fines.\n\u2022\nEuropean Union Directives: In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the European Commission (\u201cEC\u201d) initiated a plan for EU financial reform, including a number of consultations and initiatives intended to improve retail investor protections, which the EC reflected in new or updated Directives and regulations. The resulting review of MiFID, introduction of AIFMD, the introduction of MiFID 2 and the revision of the UCITS Directive have increased the compliance, disclosure and other obligations BlackRock faces in the European Economic Area. Once fully implemented, these Directives will have significant and wide-ranging impacts on EU securities and derivatives markets, which will directly and indirectly impact BlackRock\u2019s EU-regulated subsidiaries and other group companies.\n\u2022\nExtension of Retail Distribution Review rules to new markets: BlackRock must also comply with newly implemented retail distribution rules aimed at enhancing consumer protections, overhauling mutual fund fee structures and increasing professionalism in the retail investment sector. The rules were originally introduced in the United Kingdom and have since been introduced in other jurisdictions where BlackRock operates. Similarly, MiFID 2 will contain a ban on certain advisers recovering commissions and other nonmonetary benefits from fund managers. These rules, if implemented, may lead to changes to the fees and commissions BlackRock is able to charge to its clients, as well as to its client servicing and distribution models.\nLegal proceedings could cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the Company, certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock\u2019s activities. Certain of BlackRock\u2019s subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination, special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities, including the SEC, OCC, DOL, CFTC and FCA. Similarly, from time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations or proceedings. These examinations, inquiries and proceedings, have in the past and could in the future, if compliance failures or other violations are found, cause the relevant regulator to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations. Any such action may also result in litigation by investors in BlackRock\u2019s funds, other BlackRock clients or by BlackRock\u2019s shareholders, which could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund, or result in the Company being liable to the funds for damages.\nIn addition, when clients retain BlackRock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services, they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that BlackRock must observe in the provision of its services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose BlackRock to lawsuits, harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts, any of which could cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nAs BlackRock\u2019s business continues to grow, the Company must routinely address conflicts of interest, as well as the perception of conflicts of interest, between itself and its clients or employees. In addition, the SEC and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts. BlackRock has procedures and controls in place that are designed to detect and address these issues. However, appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and if the Company fails, or appears to fail, to appropriately deal with any conflict of interest, it may face reputational damage, litigation, regulatory proceedings, or penalties or other sanctions, any of which may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock is subject to banking regulations that may limit its business activities.\nAs described in \u201cItem 1 - Business-Regulation\u201d, PNC owns approximately 22% of BlackRock\u2019s capital stock. Based on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interpretation of the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve currently takes the position that this ownership interest causes BlackRock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the BHC Act, thereby subjecting BlackRock to banking regulation, including the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve. Such banking regulation limits the activities and the types of businesses that a nonbank subsidiary may conduct. The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over nonbank subsidiaries, including the power to prohibit them from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserve\u2019s opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice, and to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations. PNC is regulated as a \u201cfinancial holding company\u201d under the BHC Act, which allows PNC and BlackRock to engage in a much broader set of activities than would otherwise be permitted under the BHC Act; any failure of PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth. In addition to being subject to capital requirements established by the OCC, BlackRock\u2019s trust bank subsidiary, which is organized as a national bank, is separately subject to banking regulation by the OCC. The OCC has broad enforcement authority over BlackRock\u2019s trust bank subsidiary. Being subject to banking regulation may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because most of its competitors are not subject to these limitations.\nFailure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to BlackRock\u2019s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nOf note among the various international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company. The specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions. BlackRock continues to invest in technology, training and its employees to enhance its monitoring and reporting functions and improve the timeliness and accuracy of its disclosures. Despite these investments, the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the Company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past, and pose a risk that errors or omissions will occasionally occur in the future. Any such errors may expose BlackRock to monetary penalties, which\ncould, have an adverse effect on BlackRock\u2019s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nNew tax legislation or changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws and regulations or challenges to BlackRock\u2019s historical taxation practices may adversely affect BlackRock\u2019s effective tax rate, business and overall financial condition.\nBlackRock\u2019s businesses may be affected by new tax legislation or regulations, or the modification of existing tax laws and regulations, by U.S. or non-U.S. authorities. In particular, FATCA has introduced expansive new investor onboarding, withholding and reporting rules aimed at ensuring U.S. persons with financial assets outside of the United States pay appropriate taxes. The FATCA rules will impact both U.S. and non-U.S. funds and subject BlackRock to extensive additional administrative burdens. Similarly, there has been renewed momentum by several EU Member States to introduce an FTT, which would impose taxation on a broad range of financial instrument and derivatives transactions. If introduced as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock\u2019s financial results and on clients\u2019 performance results. In addition, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development recently launched a base erosion and profit shifting proposal that aims to rationalize tax treatment across jurisdictions. If the BEPS proposal becomes the subject of legislative action in the format proposed it could have unintended taxation consequences for collective investment vehicles and the Company\u2019s tax position, which could adversely affect BlackRock\u2019s financial condition.\nThe Company also manages significant assets in products and accounts that have specific tax and after-tax related objectives, which could be adversely impacted by changes in tax policy, particularly with respect to U.S. municipal income, U.S. individual income tax rate on qualified dividends and, globally, alternative products. Additionally, any new legislation, modification or interpretation of tax laws could impact BlackRock\u2019s corporate tax position. The application of complex tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and in the normal course of business, U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities may review and challenge BlackRock\u2019s historical tax positions. These challenges may result in adjustments to BlackRock\u2019s tax position, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock\u2019s effective tax rate and overall financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO BLACKROCK\u2019S SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDER\nPNC owns a large portion of BlackRock\u2019s capital stock. Future sales of our common stock in the public market by the Company or PNC could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2014, PNC owned 22% of the Company\u2019s capital stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nPNC has agreed to vote as a stockholder in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock\u2019s Board of Directors, and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of PNC.\nAs discussed in our proxy statement, PNC has agreed to vote all of its voting shares in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock\u2019s Board of Directors in accordance with the provisions of its stockholder agreement\nwith BlackRock. As a consequence, if the shares held by PNC constitute a substantial portion of the outstanding voting shares, matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval, including elections of directors, will have a substantial number of shares voted in accordance with the determination of the BlackRock Board of Directors. This arrangement has the effect of concentrating a significant block of voting control over BlackRock in its Board of Directors, whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the Board.\nAs discussed in our proxy statement, pursuant to our stockholder agreement with PNC, the following may not be done without prior approval of all of the independent directors, or at least two-thirds of the directors, then in office:\n\u2022\nappointment of a new Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock;\n\u2022\nany merger, issuance of shares or similar transaction in which beneficial ownership of a majority of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock would be held by persons different than those currently holding such majority of the total voting power, or any sale of all or substantially all assets of BlackRock;\n\u2022\nany acquisition of any person or business which has a consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year that equals or exceeds 20% of BlackRock\u2019s consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year if such acquisition involves the current or potential issuance of BlackRock capital stock constituting more than 10% of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock issued and outstanding immediately after completion of such acquisition;\n\u2022\nany acquisition of any person or business constituting a line of business that is materially different from the lines of business BlackRock and its controlled affiliates are engaged in at that time if such acquisition involves consideration in excess of 10% of the total assets of BlackRock on a consolidated basis;\n\u2022\nexcept for repurchases otherwise permitted under the stockholder agreement, any repurchase by BlackRock or any subsidiary of shares of BlackRock capital stock such that after giving effect to such repurchase BlackRock and its subsidiaries shall have repurchased more than 10% of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock within the 12-month period ending on the date of such repurchase;\n\u2022\nany amendment to BlackRock\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or\n\u2022\nany matter requiring stockholder approval pursuant to the rules of the NYSE.\nAdditionally, BlackRock may not enter into any of the following transactions without the prior approval of PNC:\n\u2022\nany sale of any subsidiary of BlackRock, the annualized revenue of which, together with the annualized revenue of any other subsidiaries disposed of within the same year, are more than 20% of the annualized revenue of BlackRock for the preceding fiscal year on a consolidated basis;\n\u2022\nfor so long as BlackRock is a subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the BHC Act, entering into any business or activity that is prohibited for any such subsidiary under the BHC Act;\n\u2022\nany amendment of any provision of a stockholder agreement between BlackRock and any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to PNC or materially more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock than to PNC;\n\u2022\nany amendment, modification, repeal or waiver of BlackRock\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to the rights of PNC or more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock, or any settlement or consent in a regulatory enforcement matter that would be reasonably likely to cause PNC or any of its affiliates to suffer regulatory disqualification, suspension of registration or license or other material adverse regulatory consequences; or\n\u2022\na voluntary bankruptcy or similar filing by BlackRock.", "PERMNO": 87267, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "BLK"}
