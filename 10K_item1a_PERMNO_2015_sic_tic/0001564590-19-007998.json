Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe industry in which we operate is dependent upon the U.S. residential homebuilding industry, repair and remodel activity, the economy, the credit markets, and other important factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe building products supply and services industry in the United States is highly dependent on new home construction and the repair & remodel (which we refer to as \u201cR&R\u201d) market, which in turn are dependent upon a number of factors, including interest rates, consumer confidence, employment rates, wage rates, foreclosure rates, housing inventory levels, housing demand, the availability of land, local zoning and permitting processes, the availability of construction financing and the health of the economy and mortgage markets. Unfavorable changes in demographics, credit markets, consumer confidence, health care costs, housing affordability, housing inventory levels, a weakening of the national economy or of any regional or local economy in which we operate and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect consumer spending, result in decreased demand for homes and adversely affect our businesses.\nThe U.S. homebuilding industry underwent a significant downturn that began in mid-2006 and began to stabilize in late 2011. The downturn in the homebuilding industry resulted in a substantial reduction in demand for our products and services, which in turn had a significant adverse effect on our businesses during that time. There is significant uncertainty regarding the timing and extent of recovery in home construction and R&R activity and resulting product demand levels, and any decline may materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. For example, some analysts project that the demand for residential construction may be negatively impacted as the number of renting households has increased in recent years and a shortage in the supply of affordable housing is expected to result in lower home ownership rates. Further, even if homebuilding activity fully recovers, the impact of such recovery on our businesses may be dampened if the average selling price or average size of new single-family homes decreases, which could cause homebuilders to decrease spending on our products and services.\nWe also rely on home R&R activity. High unemployment levels, high mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates, lower home prices, limited availability of mortgage and home improvement financing, and significantly lower housing turnover may restrict consumer spending, particularly on discretionary items such as home improvement projects, and affect consumer confidence levels leading to reduced spending in the R&R end market. Furthermore, with even a slight decline in the economy, nationally or in any of the markets in which we operate, consumer preferences and purchasing practices and the strategies of our customers may adjust in a manner that could result in changes to the nature and prices of products demanded by the end consumer and our customers and could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\nIn addition, beginning in 2007, the mortgage markets experienced substantial disruption due to increased defaults, primarily as a result of credit quality deterioration. The disruption resulted in a stricter regulatory environment and reduced availability of mortgages for potential homebuyers due to a tighter credit market and stricter standards to qualify for mortgages. Mortgage financing and commercial credit for smaller homebuilders, as well as for the development of new residential lots, continue to be constrained compared to pre-2007 levels. As the housing industry is dependent upon the economy as well as potential homebuyers\u2019 access to mortgage financing and homebuilders\u2019 access to commercial credit, the housing industry may not fully recover to pre-2007 levels. Prolonged weakness or another downturn in the homebuilding industry would have a significant adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our, and in particular RDS\u2019, business is in the state of California. A slowdown in the economy or a decline in homebuilding activity in California, or the occurrence of a natural disaster, could have a disproportionately negative effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nA significant portion of RDS\u2019 business is in the state of California. In 2018 and 2017, we derived approximately 51% and 63%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenue, and RDS derived approximately 78% and 98%, respectively, of its net revenue, from customers in California. We expect that a significant portion of our and RDS\u2019 revenue will continue to depend on sales within the State of California for the foreseeable future. As such, we are more susceptible to adverse developments in California than competitors with more diversified operations or if RDS had a more geographically diverse business. A slowdown in the economy, or a decline in homebuilding activity, in California could have a disproportionately negative effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, California has historically been at greater risk of certain natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, wildfires, droughts, mudslides, and civil disturbances. At times, these events have disrupted parts or all of the California economy.\nA significant decline in the general economy or the new home construction or R&R markets, and/or a deterioration in expectations regarding the homebuilding market, could cause us to record significant non-cash impairment charges, which could negatively affect our earnings and reduce stockholders\u2019 equity.\nA significant decline in the general economy or the new home construction or R&R markets, and/or a deterioration in expectations regarding the homebuilding market, could cause us to record significant non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill or other long-lived assets, which are not determinable at this time and which could negatively affect our earnings and reduce stockholders\u2019 equity. In addition, as a result of our acquisition strategy, we have recorded goodwill and may incur impairment charges in connection with prior and future acquisitions. If the value of goodwill or other intangible assets is impaired, our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity would be adversely affected.\nOur businesses are cyclical and significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions.\nThe building products supply and services industry is subject to cyclical market pressures. Demand for our products and services is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions over which we have no control, including changes in:\n\u2022\nthe number of new home and commercial building construction starts;\n\u2022\nthe production schedules of our homebuilder customers;\n\u2022\nshort- and long-term interest rates;\n\u2022\ninflation;\n\u2022\nemployment levels and job and personal income growth;\n\u2022\nhousing demand from population growth, household formation and other demographic changes;\n\u2022\navailability and pricing of mortgage financing for homebuyers and commercial financing for developers of multi-family homes and sub-contractors;\n\u2022\nconsumer confidence generally and the confidence of potential homebuyers in particular;\n\u2022\nU.S. and global financial and political system and credit market stability;\n\u2022\nprivate party and government mortgage loan programs and federal and state regulation, oversight and legal action regarding lending, appraisal, foreclosure and short sale practices;\n\u2022\nfederal and state personal income tax rates and provisions, including provisions for the deduction of mortgage loan interest payments, real estate taxes and other expenses;\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local energy efficiency programs, regulations, codes and standards; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in the markets in which we compete.\nUnfavorable changes in these conditions could adversely affect consumer spending, result in decreased demand for homes, and adversely affect our businesses generally. Any deterioration in economic conditions or increased uncertainty regarding economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe building products supply and services industry is seasonal and affected by weather-related conditions.\nOur industry is seasonal. Seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can adversely affect our businesses and operations through a decline in both the use of our products and demand for our services. Although weather patterns affect our operating results throughout the year, our first and fourth quarters have historically been, and are generally expected to continue to be, the most adversely affected by weather patterns in some of our markets, causing reduced construction activity. To the extent that severe weather conditions, such as unusually prolonged cold conditions, hurricanes, severe storms, earthquakes, floods, fires, droughts, other natural disasters or similar events occur in the markets in which we operate, construction or installation activity could be reduced, delayed or halted and our businesses may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the levels of fabrication, distribution, and installation of our products generally follow activity in the construction industry, which typically occurs in the spring, summer and fall. Warmer and drier weather during the second and third quarters typically result in higher activity and revenue levels during those quarters. Markets in which we operate that are impacted by winter weather, such as snow storms and extended periods of rain, experience a slowdown in construction activity during the beginning and the end of each calendar year, and this winter slowdown contributes to traditionally lower sales in our first and fourth quarters.\nOur industry and the markets in which we operate are highly fragmented and competitive, and increased competitive pressure may adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe building products supply and services industry is highly fragmented and competitive. We face significant competition from local, regional and national building materials chains, design centers, fabricators, and sub-contractors, as well as from privately-owned single-site enterprises. Competition varies depending on product line, type of customer and geographic area. Any of these competitors may (i) foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do, (ii) offer products and services that are deemed superior to ours, (iii) have the ability to produce or supply similar products and services at a lower cost, (iv) install building products at a lower cost, (v) develop stronger relationships with suppliers, fabricators, homebuilders, and other customers in our markets, (vi) develop a superior network of distribution centers in our markets, (vii) adapt more quickly to new technologies, new installation techniques, or evolving customer requirements, or (viii) have access to financing on more favorable terms than we can obtain. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors. In addition, home center retailers, which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and small contractors, may in the future intensify their marketing efforts to professional homebuilders. Furthermore, certain product manufacturers sell and distribute their products directly to production homebuilders. The volume of such direct sales could increase in the future. Additionally, manufacturers and specialty distributors who sell products to us may elect to sell and distribute directly to homebuilders in the future or enter into exclusive supplier arrangements with other distributors. Consolidation of production homebuilders may result in increased competition for their business. Finally, we may not be able to maintain our operating costs or product prices at a level sufficiently low for us to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete effectively, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nOur customers consider the performance and quality of the products we distribute, our customer service and price when deciding whether to use our services or purchase the products we distribute. Excess industry capacity for certain products in several geographic markets could lead to increased price competition. We may be unable to maintain our operating costs or product prices at a level that is sufficiently low for us to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete effectively with our existing competitors or new competitors enter the markets in which we operate, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, in the event that increased demand leads to higher costs for the products we install, we may have limited, if any, ability to pass on cost increases in a timely manner or at all due to the fragmented and competitive nature of our industry, which may lead to an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to warranty, casualty, construction defect, contract, tort, employment and other claims, and legal proceedings related to our businesses, the products we distribute, the services we provide, and services provided for us by third parties.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various claims and litigation. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources. As a sub-contractor, we are regularly subject to construction defects claims on various housing tracts. We may not always be able to successfully defend or be excused from the lawsuits related to these claims and could be subject to substantial losses.\nWe are also from time to time subject to casualty, contract, tort and other claims relating to our businesses, the products we have distributed in the past or may in the future distribute, and the services we have provided in the past or may in the future provide, either directly or through third parties. If any such claim were adversely determined, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected if we were unable to seek indemnification for such claims or were not adequately insured for such claims. We rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with the products we sell or distribute. Since we do not have direct control over the quality of products that are manufactured or supplied to us by third-parties, we are particularly vulnerable to risks relating to the quality of such products.\nIn addition, we are exposed to potential claims arising from the conduct of our employees, builders and their sub-contractors, and third-party installers for which we may be liable. We and they are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of third-party installers. As they apply to our businesses, if we fail to manage these processes effectively or provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\nFurthermore, claims and investigations may arise related to distributor relationships, commercial contracts, antitrust or competition law requirements, employment matters, employee benefits issues and other compliance and regulatory matters, including anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters. While we have processes and policies designed to mitigate these risks and to investigate and address such claims as they arise, we cannot predict or, in some cases, control the costs to defend or resolve such claims.\nAlthough we believe we currently maintain suitable and adequate insurance, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities, and the cost of any warranty, casualty, construction defect, contract, tort, employment or other litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Additionally, we do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our businesses may encounter. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts. Warranty, casualty, construction defect, contract, tort, employment and other claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in our products and us. There can be no assurance that any current or future claims will not adversely affect our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.\nProduct shortages, loss of key suppliers or failure to develop relationships with qualified suppliers, our dependence on third-party suppliers and manufacturers, or the development of alternatives to distributors in the supply chain, could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur ability to offer a wide variety of products to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate product supply from manufacturers and other suppliers. Generally, our products are obtainable from various sources and in sufficient quantities to meet our operating needs. However, the loss of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In prior downturns in the housing industry, manufacturers have reduced capacity by closing plants and production lines within plants. Even if such capacity reductions are not permanent, there may be a delay in manufacturers\u2019 ability to increase capacity in times of rising demand. If the demand for products from manufacturers and other suppliers exceeds the available supply, we may be unable to source additional products in sufficient quantity or quality in a timely manner and the prices for the products that we install could rise. These developments could affect our ability to take advantage of market opportunities and limit our growth prospects.\nOur ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. Our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers\u2019 non-compliance with applicable laws, tariffs and import duties, supply disruptions, shipping interruptions or costs, and other factors beyond our control. The loss of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAlthough in some instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by either party without notice or on limited notice. Many of our suppliers also offer us favorable terms based on the volume of our purchases. If market conditions change, suppliers may stop offering us favorable terms. Failure by our suppliers to continue to supply us with products on favorable terms, commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could put pressure on our operating margins or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, our larger customers, such as homebuilders, fabricators, and dealers, could begin purchasing more of their product needs directly from manufacturers, which would result in decreases in our net sales and earnings. Our suppliers could invest in infrastructure to expand their own sales forces and sell more products directly to our customers, which also would negatively impact our businesses. These changes in the supply chain could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA material disruption at one of our suppliers\u2019 facilities or loss of a supplier relationship could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and negatively affect our overall financial results.\nAny of the following events could cease or limit operations unexpectedly: fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, on-site or off-site environmental incidents or other catastrophes; utility and transportation infrastructure disruptions; labor difficulties; other operational problems; or war, acts of terrorism or other unexpected events. Any downtime or facility damage at our suppliers could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products or require us to make more expensive purchases from a competing supplier. If our suppliers were to incur significant downtime, our ability to satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in customers seeking products from other distributors as well as decreased customer satisfaction and lower sales and operating income. In addition, a loss of a supplier relationship could harm our operations. Because we purchase from a limited number of suppliers, the effects of any particular shutdown or facility damage or loss of a supplier relationship could be significant to our operations.\nIn addition, our suppliers\u2019 inability to produce or procure the necessary raw materials to supply finished goods to us may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.\nIf we fail to qualify for supplier rebates or are unable to maintain or adequately renegotiate our rebate arrangements, our gross margins and income could be adversely affected.\nMany of our products, such as flooring, tile and finish carpentry, are purchased pursuant to rebate arrangements that entitle us to receive a rebate based on the volume of our purchases. Such arrangements generally require us to purchase minimum quantities in certain geographies or product categories and result in higher rebates with increased quantities of purchases. These rebates effectively reduce the costs of our products and we manage our businesses to take advantage of these programs. When assessing the desirability of acquisitions, we consider the effects of such acquisitions on our ability to qualify for rebates. Rebate arrangements are subject to renegotiation with our suppliers from time to time. In addition, consolidation of suppliers may result in the reduction or elimination of rebate programs in which we participate. If we are unable to qualify for these rebates, are unable to renew rebate programs on desirable terms or are unable to obtain the expected rebate benefits of our acquisitions, or a supplier materially reduces or stops offering rebates, our costs could increase and our gross margins and income could be adversely affected.\nChanges in product mix or the costs of the products we install can decrease our profit margins.\nThe principal building products that we distribute and install have been subject to price changes in the past, some of which have been significant. Our operating results for individual quarterly periods can be, and have been, adversely affected by a delay between when building product cost increases are implemented and when we are able to increase prices for our products and services, if at all. Our supplier purchase prices often depend on volume requirements. If we do not meet these volume requirements, our costs could increase and our margins may be adversely affected. In addition, while we have been able to achieve cost savings through volume purchasing and our relationships with suppliers, we may not be able to continue to receive advantageous pricing for the products that we supply, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur profitability is also impacted by the mix of products that we install. There can be no assurance that the current product mix will continue, and any shift to options with lower profit margin could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nPolitical and economic uncertainty and unrest in foreign countries where our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn 2018, approximately 34% and 14% of ASG\u2019s revenue came from products that were obtained directly from suppliers located in Vietnam and China, respectively. We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with changing economic and political conditions in these or other foreign countries in which we source, or in the future may source, any of our products, such as:\n\u2022\nincreased import duties, tariffs, trade restrictions, and quotas;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages;\n\u2022\neconomic uncertainties (including inflation);\n\u2022\nadverse foreign government regulations, government control, or sudden changes in laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nwars, fears of war, and terrorist attacks; and\n\u2022\norganizing activities and political unrest.\nWe cannot predict if, when, or the extent to which, the countries in which we source our products will experience any of the above events. Any event causing a disruption, delay or cessation of imports from foreign locations would likely increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us, and cause us to seek alternative sources for our products, which may only be available on less advantageous terms, and would adversely affect our operating results.\nThe importation of building materials into the United States could expose us to additional risk.\nA significant portion of the building materials that we distribute and/or install come from foreign jurisdictions outside North America. Such materials may be imported because they may not be available for domestic purchase in the United States or because there may be a shortfall of inventory available locally. Despite our efforts to ensure the merchantability of these products, such products may not adhere to U.S. standards or laws. In addition, pricing of these products can be impacted by changes to the relative value of the U.S. dollar over the applicable foreign currency in the long-term, which could negatively impact our margins. Importation of such building materials could subject us to greater risk, including currency risk, and lawsuits by customers or governmental entities.\nWe may be unable to effectively manage our inventory and working capital as our sales volume increases or the prices of the products we distribute fluctuate, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe purchase certain materials, including wood and laminate flooring, natural and engineered stone, tile for wall and flooring applications, glass for shower enclosures and mirrors, millwork, and interior doors, from manufacturers or quarries, which are then sold to customers as an installed product or as a prefabricated and installed product. We must maintain and have adequate working capital to purchase sufficient inventory to meet customer demand. Due to the lead times required by our suppliers, we order products in advance of expected sales. As a result, we are required to forecast our sales and purchase accordingly. In periods characterized by significant changes in economic growth and activity in the commercial and residential construction and home R&R end markets, it can be especially difficult to forecast our sales accurately. We must also manage our working capital to fund our inventory purchases. Excessive increases in the market prices of certain products can put negative pressure on our operating cash flows by requiring us to invest more in inventory. In the future, if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory and working capital as we attempt to expand our businesses, or if we make changes to how we manage our payments to suppliers, our cash flows may be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to significant pricing pressures from homebuilders, contractors, fabricators, dealers and other customers.\nLarge homebuilders, contractors, fabricators, and dealers have historically been able to exert significant pressure on their outside suppliers and distributors to keep prices low in the highly fragmented building products supply and services industry. In addition, continued consolidation in the residential homebuilding industry and changes in builders\u2019 purchasing policies and payment practices could result in even further pricing pressure. For example, there has been a recent trend of large publicly-traded homebuilders acquiring other large homebuilders, which increases their market share and buying power. Our homebuilder customers may be acquired by other homebuilders that we do not currently have relationships with, which may make it difficult for us to maintain our current market share and margins. A decline in the prices of the products we distribute and the services we provide could adversely impact our operating results. When the prices of our products and services decline, customer demand for lower prices could result in lower sales prices and, to the extent that our inventory at the time was purchased at higher costs, lower margins. Alternatively, due to the rising market price environment, our suppliers may increase prices or reduce discounts on the products we distribute and we may be unable to pass on any cost increase to our customers, thereby resulting in reduced margins and profits. Overall, these pricing pressures may adversely affect our results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe loss of any of our significant customers or a reduction in the quantity of products they purchase could affect our financial health.\nOur ten largest customers generated approximately 36% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, in 2018, one customer accounted for approximately 11% of our total revenue. We cannot guarantee that we will maintain or improve our relationships with these customers or that we will continue to supply these customers at historical levels. Due to the weak housing market over the past several years relative to long-term averages, many of our homebuilder and fabricator customers substantially reduced their construction activity. Some homebuilder customers exited or severely curtailed building activity in certain of our markets. In the future, additional homebuilder customers may exit or decrease their building activity in one or more of our markets. Our historically high rate of customer retention is not necessarily indicative of our future customer retention.\nIn addition, homebuilders and other customers may: (i) purchase some of the products that we currently sell and distribute directly from manufacturers; (ii) elect to establish their own building products manufacturing, fabrication, distribution, and/or installation facilities; or (iii) give advantages to manufacturing, fabrication, distribution, and/or installation intermediaries in which they have an economic stake. Continued consolidation among homebuilders could also result in a loss of some of our present customers to our competitors. The loss of one or more of our significant customers or deterioration in our existing relationships with any of our customers could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFurthermore, our customers are not required to purchase any minimum amount of product from us. Should our customers purchase the products we distribute or install in significantly lower quantities than they have in the past, or should the customers of any business that we acquire purchase products from us in significantly lower quantities than they had prior to our acquisition of such business, such decreased purchases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn an attempt to diversify and expand its customer base, RDS may target smaller homebuilders. This exposes RDS to additional risks, such as increased non-payment risk of those customers, especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets.\nRDS\u2019 customers may be affected by shortages in labor supply, increased labor costs or labor disruptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur customers require a qualified labor force to build homes and communities, and we require a qualified labor force to install our products in those homes. Access to qualified labor and sub-contractors by our customers and us may be affected by circumstances beyond their or our control, including:\n\u2022\nshortages of qualified trades people, such as flooring, tile and cabinet installers, carpenters, roofers, electricians and plumbers, especially in key markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in immigration laws and trends in labor force migration; and\n\u2022\nincreases in sub-contractor and professional services costs.\nLabor shortages can be further exacerbated if demand for housing increases. Any of these circumstances could also give rise to delays in the start or completion of, or could increase the cost of, building homes. Such delays and cost increases would also have an effect on our ability to generate sales from homebuyers and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur backlog estimates for our RDS segment may not be accurate and may not generate expected levels of future revenues or translate into profits.\nEstimates of future financial results are inherently unreliable. Our backlog estimates of potential future revenue for our RDS segment require substantial judgment and are based on a number of assumptions, including management\u2019s current assessment of customer contracts that exist as of the date the estimates are made and the expected revenue to be derived from sales related to remaining housing lots to be fulfilled under existing service agreements for active residential developments. A number of factors could result in actual revenue being less than the amounts reflected in our estimates, such as upgrade rates or upgrade amounts being lower than expected, or modification or cancellation of contracts by homebuilders. Actual rates and amounts may differ from historical experiences used to estimate potential future revenue. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will actually generate the specified revenue or that the actual revenue will be generated within the estimated period. If such revenue fails to materialize, we could experience a reduction in revenue and a decline in profitability, which could result in a deterioration of our financial position and liquidity.\nWe may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share.\nIt is difficult to predict successfully the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our businesses depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to changes in demographics, consumer preferences, expectations, needs and weather conditions, while also managing inventory levels. For example, a significant portion of the product that we distribute is natural stone. If a natural stone product becomes unavailable for any reason or the color and quality changes within the quarry we purchase from, we may not be able to replace that particular color or quality with an acceptable alternative. In general, the products we sell are affected by style trends, customer preferences and changes thereto. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations, and building product needs could possibly result in obsolete or devalued inventory, and adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.\nThe success of our businesses depends, in part, on our ability to execute on our growth strategy, which includes opening new branches and pursuing strategic acquisitions.\nOur long-term business strategy depends in part on increasing our sales and growing our market share through opening new branches, including through our greenfield initiatives, and strategic acquisitions. A significant portion of our historical growth has occurred through acquisitions, and our business plan provides for continued growth through acquisitions in the future. We are presently evaluating, and we expect to continue to evaluate on an ongoing basis, a variety of possible acquisition transactions, including both smaller acquisitions and larger acquisitions that would be material. We regularly make, and we expect to continue to make, acquisition proposals, and we may enter into letters of intent for acquisitions. We cannot predict the timing of any contemplated transactions, and there can be no assurances that we will identify suitable acquisition opportunities or, if we do identify such opportunities, that any transaction can be consummated on acceptable terms. We may be unable to continue to grow our businesses through acquisitions. In addition, the past performance or size of our greenfield investments is not necessarily indicative of future performance or investment size. Furthermore, significant changes in our businesses or the economy, an unexpected decrease in our cash flows, or any restrictions imposed by our debt may limit our ability to obtain the necessary capital for acquisitions or otherwise impede our ability to complete an acquisition. Our recent growth and our acquisition strategy have placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management\u2019s time, which may divert their attention from our businesses, and may lead to significant due diligence and other expenses regardless of whether we pursue or consummate any acquisition. Failure to identify suitable transaction partners and to consummate transactions on acceptable terms, as well as the commitment of time and resources in connection with such transactions, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTo a large extent, our growth strategy depends on RDS and ASG forming a strong, scalable platform. Our platform was formed in November 2017 and continues to be developed. There can be no assurance that we will be able to implement this platform across all, if any, markets, products and services where we currently plan to grow.\nOur acquisition strategy exposes us to significant risks and additional costs.\nIn the last two years, we have completed eight acquisitions, and we continue to evaluate further possible acquisitions on an ongoing basis. Acquisitions also involve risks that the business acquired will not perform as expected and that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of the acquired business will prove incorrect. We may not accurately assess the value, strengths, weaknesses or potential profitability of an acquisition target. We may become liable for certain pre-acquisition liabilities of an acquired business, including, among others, tax liabilities, product liabilities, asbestos liabilities, environmental liabilities, pension liabilities and liabilities for employment practices, and these liabilities could be significant. In addition, an acquisition could result in the impairment of customer relationships or certain acquired assets such as inventory and goodwill. We may also incur costs and inefficiencies to the extent an acquisition expands the industries, products, markets or geographies in which we operate due to our limited exposure to and experience in a given industry, market or region. Acquisitions can also involve post-transaction disputes with the counterparty regarding a number of matters, including a purchase price, inventory or other working capital adjustment, environmental liabilities, or pension obligations. If any of these risks were to occur, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing our equity securities or securities convertible into our equity securities, our existing stockholders would be diluted, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock. We could also finance an acquisition with debt, resulting in higher leverage and interest costs relating to the acquisition. As a result, if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions efficiently, we may not ultimately experience the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions, and we may incur costs that exceed our expectations.\nAny inability to successfully integrate our recent or future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAcquisitions typically require integration of the acquired companies\u2019 sales and marketing, distribution, purchasing, finance and administrative functions, as well as exposure to different legal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions in which we have not previously operated. We may not be able to integrate successfully any business we acquire into our existing business or may not be able to do so in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner. Our inability to complete the integration of new businesses in a timely and orderly manner could increase costs and lower profits. Factors affecting the successful integration of acquired businesses include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nour inability to manage acquired businesses or control integration costs and other costs relating to acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndiverting the attention of our management and that of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nmerging or linking different accounting and financial reporting systems and systems of internal controls;\n\u2022\nmerging computer, technology and other information networks and systems;\n\u2022\nassimilating personnel, human resources and other administrative departments and potentially contrasting corporate cultures;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain existing key personnel of the acquired businesses and recruit qualified new employees at new locations;\n\u2022\ndisrupting our relationship with, or loss of, key customers or suppliers;\n\u2022\nincurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ninterfering with, or loss of momentum in, our ongoing business or that of the acquired company; and\n\u2022\ndelays or cost-overruns in the integration process.\nAny of these acquisition or other integration-related issues could divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our day-to-day operations, cause significant disruption to our businesses, and lead to substantial additional costs. Our inability to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or to successfully integrate acquired companies as well as other transaction-related issues could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, possible future acquisitions or dispositions may trigger a review by the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and/or the State Attorneys General under their respective regulatory authority, focusing on the effects on competition, including the size or structure of the relevant markets and the pro-competitive benefits of the transaction. Any delay, prohibition or modification required by regulatory authorities could adversely affect the terms of a proposed acquisition or could require us to modify or abandon an otherwise attractive acquisition opportunity.\nWe may be subject to claims or liabilities arising from the operations of our various businesses for periods prior to the dates we acquired them, including environmental, employee-related and other claims and liabilities not covered by insurance. These claims or liabilities could be significant.\nWe may be subject to claims or liabilities arising from the ownership or operation of acquired businesses for the periods prior to our acquisition of them, including environmental, employee-related and other liabilities and claims not covered by insurance. These claims or liabilities could be significant. Our ability to seek indemnification from the former owners of our acquired businesses for these claims or liabilities may be limited by various factors, including the specific time, monetary or other limitations contained in the respective acquisition agreements and the financial ability of the former owners to satisfy our indemnification claims. In addition, insurance companies may be unwilling to cover claims that have arisen from acquired businesses or locations, or claims may exceed the coverage limits that our acquired businesses had in effect prior to the date of acquisition. If we are unable to successfully obtain insurance coverage of third-party claims or enforce our indemnification rights against the former owners, or if the former owners are unable to satisfy their obligations for any reason, including because of their current financial position, we could be held liable for the costs or obligations associated with such claims or liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot assure you that we will achieve synergies and cost savings in connection with prior or future acquisitions.\nWe may not achieve anticipated cost savings in connection with prior or future acquisitions within the anticipated time frames or at all. In addition, our operating results from these acquisitions could, in the future, result in impairment charges for any of our intangible assets, including goodwill, or other long-lived assets, particularly if economic conditions worsen unexpectedly. These changes could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to expand into new geographic markets, which may impact our ability to grow our businesses.\nWe intend to continue to pursue our growth strategy to expand into new geographic markets for the foreseeable future. Our expansion into new geographic markets may present competitive, distribution and other challenges that differ from the challenges we currently face. In addition, we may be less familiar with the customers in these markets and may ultimately face different or additional risks, as well as increased or unexpected costs, compared to those we experience in our existing markets. We may also be unfamiliar with the labor force in these markets and may have difficulty finding and retaining necessary skilled or qualified workers on acceptable terms, or at all. Expansion into new geographic markets may also expose us to direct competition with companies with whom we have limited or no past experience as competitors. Furthermore, some of our customer and supplier agreements may restrict the markets where we are able to distribute certain products, and these limitations could negatively impact our ability to achieve success in new markets. To the extent we rely upon expanding into new geographic markets and do not meet, or are unprepared for, any new challenges posed by such expansion, our future sales growth could be negatively impacted, our operating costs could increase, and our businesses, operations, and financial results could be negatively affected.\nWe occupy many of our facilities under long-term non-cancellable leases, and we may be unable to renew our leases at the end of their terms.\nMany of our facilities and distribution centers are located on leased premises. Many of our current leases are non-cancellable and typically have initial terms ranging from one to 12 years, and most provide options to renew for specified periods of time. We believe that leases we enter into in the future will likely be long-term and non-cancellable and have similar renewal options. If we close or idle a facility, we would most likely remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, which would include, among other things, payment of the base rent, insurance, taxes and other expenses on the leased property for the balance of the lease term. The inability to terminate leases when idling a facility or exiting a geographic market can have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, at the end of the lease term and any renewal period for a facility, we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, if at all. If we are unable to renew our facility leases, we may close or relocate a facility, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to secure a replacement facility in a location that is as commercially viable, including easy access to transportation and shipping, as the lease we are unable to renew. For example, closing a facility, even during the time of relocation, will reduce the sales that the facility would have contributed to our net revenue. Additionally, the net revenue and profit, if any, generated at a relocated facility may not equal the net revenue and profit generated at the existing one.\nNatural or man-made disruptions to our facilities may adversely affect our businesses and operations.\nWe currently maintain a broad network of distribution facilities throughout the United States. Any widespread disruption to our facilities or those of our suppliers resulting from fire, earthquake, weather-related events, an act of terrorism or any other cause could damage a significant portion of our facilities and inventory and could materially impair our ability to distribute our products to customers. We could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers during the time that it takes for us to reopen or replace a damaged facility. In addition, any shortages of fuel or significant fuel cost increases could disrupt our ability to distribute products to our customers. Disruptions to the national or local transportation infrastructure systems, including those related to a domestic terrorist attack, may also affect our ability to keep our operations and services functioning properly. If any of these events were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nAnti-terrorism measures and other disruptions to the transportation network could impact our distribution system and our operations.\nOur ability to efficiently distribute products to our customers is an integral component of our overall business strategy. In the aftermath of terrorist attacks in the United States, federal, state and local authorities have implemented and continue to implement various security measures that affect many parts of the transportation network in the United States. Our customers typically need quick delivery and rely on our on-time delivery capabilities. If security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries, we may fail to meet the needs of our customers or may incur increased expenses to do so.\nThe implementation of new initiatives related to our operating software systems and related technology could disrupt our operations, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail.\nWe have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our operating software systems and related technology. These initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our employees to continue to provide high quality service to our customers, while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected purchasing experience. The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. In the event that we grow very rapidly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep up, expand or adapt our IT infrastructure to meet evolving demand on a timely basis and at a commercially reasonable cost, or at all. In addition, our new and upgraded technology might cost more than anticipated or might not provide the anticipated benefits, or it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether. Because the success of our growth strategy depends in part on our IT infrastructure, problems with any related initiatives may adversely affect our businesses, operations, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks, and a disruption or breach of our IT systems could adversely impact our businesses and operations.\nWe rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our IT systems, some of which are managed or hosted by third parties, and our ability to continually update these systems in response to the changing needs of our businesses. We have incurred costs and may incur significant additional costs in order to implement security measures that we feel are appropriate to protect our IT systems. Our security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, natural or man-made disasters, unauthorized access, cyberattacks and other similar disruptions. Despite our security measures, our IT systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any attacks on our IT systems could result in our systems or data being breached or damaged by computer viruses or unauthorized physical or electronic access, which could lead to delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders, and adversely affect our customer service and relationships. Such a breach could result in not only business disruption, but also theft of our intellectual property or other competitive information or unauthorized access to controlled data and any personal information stored in our IT systems. To the extent that any data is lost or destroyed, or any confidential information is inappropriately disclosed or used, it could adversely affect our competitive position or customer relationships. In addition, any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our businesses, products and services, which could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nTo date, we have not experienced a material breach of our IT systems. As cyber-attacks become more sophisticated generally, we may be required to incur significant costs to strengthen our systems from outside intrusions and/or maintain insurance coverage related to the threat of such attacks. While we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our IT, they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks, or other security breaches to our computer systems.\nWe depend on key personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of certain key personnel and other members of our management team, each of whom would be difficult to replace. If any of our key personnel were to cease employment with us, our operating results could suffer. Further, the process of attracting and retaining suitable replacements for key personnel whose services we may lose would result in transition costs and would divert the attention of other members of our senior management from our existing operations. The loss of services from key personnel or a limitation in their availability could materially and adversely impact our businesses, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets. We have not obtained and do not expect to obtain key man life insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of death or disability of any of our key personnel.\nAn inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could adversely affect our businesses.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense. We have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications, such as build tradesmen for finish carpentry and for installation of tile, flooring and cabinets. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than us. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached their legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our businesses and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nRDS\u2019 business and results of operations are significantly dependent on the availability and skill of sub-contractors.\nWe engage sub-contractors to perform the installation of the products that we sell to our customers. Accordingly, the timing and quality of our installations depends on the availability and skill of our sub-contractors. While we believe that our relationships with sub-contractors are good, we generally do not have long-term contractual commitments with any sub-contractors, and we can provide no assurance that skilled sub-contractors will continue to be available at reasonable rates and in our markets. Competition for skilled contractors can be significant in our markets. The inability to contract with skilled sub-contractors at reasonable rates and on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDespite our quality control efforts, we may discover that our sub-contractors have engaged in improper construction practices or have installed defective materials in the homes of our customers. The adverse costs of satisfying our warranty and other legal obligations in these instances may be significant and we may be unable to recover the costs of warranty-related repairs from sub-contractors, suppliers and insurers, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf any of RDS\u2019 sub-contractors are characterized as employees, we would be subject to employment and withholding liabilities.\nWe structure our relationships with our sub-contractors in a manner that we believe results in an independent contractor relationship, not an employee relationship. An independent contractor is generally distinguished from an employee by his or her degree of autonomy and independence in providing services. A high degree of autonomy and independence is generally indicative of a contractor relationship, while a high degree of control is generally indicative of an employment relationship. Although we believe that our sub-contractors are properly characterized as independent contractors, tax or other regulatory authorities may in the future challenge our characterization of these relationships. If such regulatory authorities or state, federal or foreign courts were to determine that our sub-contractors are employees, and not independent contractors, we would be required to withhold income taxes, to withhold and pay social security, Medicare and similar taxes, and to pay unemployment and other related payroll taxes. We would also be liable for unpaid past taxes and subject to penalties. As a result, any determination that our sub-contractors are our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in employment laws may adversely affect our businesses.\nVarious federal and state labor laws govern the relationship with our employees and impact operating costs. These laws include:\n\u2022\nemployee classification as exempt or non-exempt for overtime and other purposes;\n\u2022\nminimum wage requirements;\n\u2022\nunemployment tax rates;\n\u2022\nworkers\u2019 compensation rates;\n\u2022\nimmigration status;\n\u2022\nmandatory health benefits;\n\u2022\npaid leaves of absence, including paid sick leave;\n\u2022\ntax reporting; and\n\u2022\nother wage and benefit requirements.\nSignificant additional government-imposed increases in the preceding areas could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, various states in which we operate are considering or have already adopted new immigration laws or enforcement programs, and, from time to time, the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security consider and implement changes to federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs. These changes may increase our compliance and oversight obligations, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we take steps to verify the employment eligibility status of all our employees, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. Unauthorized workers are subject to deportation and may subject us to fines or penalties and, if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized, we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and retain qualified employees. Termination of a significant number of employees who were unauthorized employees may disrupt our operations, cause temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees and result in additional adverse publicity. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration laws. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFederal, state, local and other regulations could impose substantial costs and/or restrictions on our operations that would reduce our net income.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and other laws and regulations, including, among other things, transportation regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (which we refer to as the \u201cDOT\u201d), work safety regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (which we refer to as \u201cOSHA\u201d), employment regulations promulgated by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, regulations of the U.S. Department of Labor, accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or similar entities, and state and local zoning restrictions, building codes and contractors\u2019 licensing regulations. More burdensome regulatory requirements in these or other areas may increase our general and administrative costs and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Moreover, failure to comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to our businesses could expose us to litigation and substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur transportation operations, upon which we depend to distribute products from our distribution centers, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the DOT, which has broad administrative powers with respect to our transportation operations. Vehicle dimensions and driver hours of service also are subject to both federal and state regulation. More restrictive limitations on vehicle weight and size, trailer length and configuration, or driver hours of service would increase our costs, which, if we are unable to pass these cost increases on to our customers, may increase our selling, general and administrative expenses and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. If we fail to comply adequately with the DOT regulations or regulations become more stringent, we could experience increased inspections, regulatory authorities could take remedial action including imposing fines or shutting down our operations or we could be subject to increased audit and compliance costs. If any of these events were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the homebuilding industry is subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, codes, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design and safety, construction, energy conservation, environmental protection and similar matters. Regulatory restrictions may increase our operating expenses and limit the availability of suitable building lots for our customers, which could negatively affect our sales and earnings.\nFailure to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things: the release or discharge of materials into the environment; the management, use, generation, treatment, processing, handling, storage, transport or disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials; and the protection of public and employee health and safety and the environment. These laws and regulations impose strict liability in some cases without regard to negligence or fault and expose us to liability for the environmental condition of our currently or formerly owned, leased or operated facilities, and may expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our\nactions, even if such actions complied with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken. These laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for claims of personal injury or property or natural resource damage related to alleged exposure to, or releases of, regulated or hazardous materials. The existence of contamination at properties we own, lease or operate could also result in increased operational costs or restrictions on our ability to use those properties as intended, including for purposes of construction materials distribution. In addition, because our properties are generally situated adjacent to or near industrial companies, our properties may be at an increased risk of having environmental contaminants from other properties spill or migrate onto or otherwise affect our properties.\nAlthough we believe that we operate our businesses, including each of our locations, in compliance with applicable local environmental laws and regulations, and maintain all material permits required under such laws and regulations to operate our businesses, we may be held liable or incur fines or penalties in connection with such requirements. While our employees who handle potentially hazardous substances receive specialized training and wear protective equipment when necessary, there is still a risk that they, or others, may be exposed to these substances. Exposure to these substances could result in significant injury to our employees and others, including site occupants, and damage to our property or the property of others, including natural resource damage. Our personnel and others at our work sites are also at risk for other workplace-related injuries, including slips and falls. In addition, as owners and lessees of real property, we may be held liable for, among other things, hazardous substances on, at, under or emanating from currently or formerly owned or operated properties, or any off-site disposal locations, or for any known or newly discovered environmental conditions at or relating to any of our properties, including those arising from activities conducted by previous occupants or at adjoining properties, without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for such release. We may be required to investigate, remove, remediate or monitor the presence or release of such hazardous substances. We may also be held liable for fines, penalties or damages, including for bodily injury, property damage and natural resource damage in connection with the presence or release of hazardous substances. In addition, expenditures may be required in the future as a result of releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances, the discovery of currently unknown environmental conditions, or changes in environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation or enforcement, and, in certain instances, such expenditures may be material.\nDespite our compliance efforts, there is an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our businesses, especially from an environmental standpoint, and, from time to time, we may be in non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These potential liabilities or non-compliances could have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability. Our failure to comply with applicable governmental requirements could result in sanctions, including substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some or all of our operations. Future changes in law, resulting in stricter laws and regulations, more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations or the future discovery of environmental conditions may impose new liabilities on us, reduce operating hours, require additional investment by us, or impede our ability to open new or expand existing plants or facilities. We have incurred, and may in the future incur, significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. The cost of complying with such laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nChanges in legislation and government policy may have a material adverse effect on our businesses in the future.\nThe 2016 presidential and congressional elections in the United States have resulted in significant changes in legislation and government policy. In addition to the recent reform of the federal tax code, specific legislative and regulatory proposals discussed during and after the election that could have a material impact on us include, but are not limited to, modifications to international trade policy and increased regulation. Furthermore, proposals have been discussed regarding the imposition of new or additional taxes or tariffs on goods imported from abroad that are used in our businesses or the elimination of income tax deductibility of such imported goods. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased an estimated $117.6 million of material sourced from outside the United States.\nFor example, in September 2018 and November 2018, in response to a petition filed by Cambria Company LLC, a U.S. producer of quartz surface products, with the U.S. Department of Commerce (which we refer to as the \u201cDOC\u201d) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (which we refer to as the \u201cITC\u201d), the DOC announced preliminary determinations provisionally subjecting U.S. importers to countervailing and antidumping duties on subject quartz products pending a final decision by the ITC. Imports of the subject products made during June 23, 2018 to November 19, 2018 are potentially subject to retroactive antidumping and/or countervailing duties. One of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries, Architectural Granite & Marble, LLC, imported quartz surface products during the retroactive duty application time period and has potential liability for antidumping and/or countervailing duties. The ITC is expected to make a final decision on this matter in June 2019.\nWe are currently unable to predict the extent of the changes to existing legislative and regulatory environments relevant to our businesses, or how those and potential future changes would impact our businesses. To the extent that such changes have a negative impact on us or the industries we serve, including the imposition of additional duties discussed above or otherwise, these changes may materially and adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, result of operations, and cash flows.\nTax matters, including changes in tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value added, net worth, property, withholding and franchise taxes. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the \u201cIRS\u201d) and other taxing authorities with respect to such income and non-income based taxes. If the IRS or another taxing authority disagrees with our tax positions, we could face additional tax liabilities, including interest and penalties. Payment of such additional amounts upon final settlement or adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nIn addition, we are directly and indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation, and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Changes in legislation, regulation or interpretation of existing laws and regulations, including the changes to the federal tax code pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we will benefit from a reduction of our corporate income tax rate. However, the impact of the various limitations, reductions and the repeal of certain expenses, deductions and tax credits are presently unknown and the tax liability of our businesses may be increased, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to taxes by the U.S. federal, state, and local tax authorities, and our tax liabilities will be affected by the allocation of expenses to differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nexpected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022\ntax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; or\n\u2022\nfuture earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal, state, and local taxing authorities. The impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as well as outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe may use additional leverage in executing our business strategy, which may adversely affect our businesses.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the principal amount of our total indebtedness was approximately $185.6 million, consisting of (i) $37.2 million under the SIC revolving credit facility, (ii) $144.2 million under the ASG term loan, and (iii) $4.2 million of vehicle and equipment loans, capital leases, and other term debt. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, there was also $0.3 million of outstanding letters of credit. We had the ability to access approximately $52.5 million of unused borrowings available under the SIC revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2018, and, as part of our growth strategy, we may incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future. Our existing indebtedness is recourse to us and we anticipate that future indebtedness will likewise be recourse. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risk that we now face could intensify.\nOur board of directors will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of new indebtedness, including the purchase price of assets to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our assets and the ability of particular assets, and our company as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover the expected debt service. As a means of sustaining our long-term financial health and limiting our exposure to unforeseen dislocations in the debt and financing markets, we currently expect to remain conservatively capitalized; however, our charter does not contain a limitation on the amount of debt we may incur and our board of directors may change our target debt levels at any time without the approval of our stockholders.\nIncurring a substantial amount of debt could have important consequences for our businesses, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt or to our trade or other creditors;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, particularly when the availability of financing in the capital markets is limited;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors.\nWe cannot assure you that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us through capital markets financings or under our credit facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness that we will incur on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in order to finance our operations or to repay our indebtedness. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional debt or equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. We cannot assure you that any such actions, if necessary, could be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or on terms that would be advantageous to our stockholders or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future financing arrangements.\nOur current financing arrangements contain, and our future financing arrangements likely will contain, restrictive covenants relating to our operations.\nOur current financing arrangements contain, and the financing arrangements we enter into in the future likely will contain, covenants (financial and otherwise) affecting our ability to incur additional debt, incur liens, make certain investments, sell our shares, reduce liquidity below certain levels, make distributions to our stockholders and otherwise affect our operating policies. The restrictions contained in our financing arrangements could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or make acquisitions or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans. If we fail to meet or satisfy any of these covenants in our financing arrangements, we would be in default under these arrangements, and our lenders could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable, terminate their commitments, require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their respective interests against existing collateral. In addition, our financing arrangements may contain cross-default provisions. As a result, if we default in our payment or performance obligations under one of our financing arrangements and, in some cases, if the amount due thereunder is accelerated, other financing arrangements, if any, may be declared in default and accelerated even though we are meeting payment and performance obligations on those other arrangements. If this occurs, we may not have sufficient available cash to pay all amounts that are then due and payable under our financing arrangements, and we may have to seek additional debt or equity financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms. If alternative financing is not available, we may have to curtail our investment activities and/or sell assets in order to obtain the funds required to make the accelerated payments or seek ways to restructure the loan obligations. If we default on several of our financing arrangements or any single significant financing arrangement, it could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nInterest expense on debt we will incur may limit our cash available to fund our growth strategies.\nOur current financing arrangements have, and any additional debt we subsequently incur may have, a floating rate of interest. Higher interest rates could increase debt service requirements on our current floating rate debt and on any floating rate debt we subsequently incur, and could reduce funds available for operations, future business opportunities or other purposes. If we need to repay debt during periods of rising interest rates, we could be required to refinance our then-existing debt on unfavorable terms or liquidate one or more of our assets to repay such debt at times which may not permit realization of the maximum return on such assets and could result in a loss. The occurrence of either or both of such events could materially and adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nWe may require additional capital in the future and may not be able to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us.\nThe expansion and development of our businesses may require significant capital, which we may be unable to obtain, to fund our capital expenditures, operating expenses, working capital needs, and potential strategic acquisitions. In accordance with our growth strategy, we may opportunistically raise additional debt capital to help fund the growth of our businesses, subject to market and other conditions, but such debt capital may not be available to us on a timely basis to meet our cash requirements. Further, our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if, for example, our revenues do not reach expected levels or we have to incur unforeseen capital expenditures and make investments to maintain our competitive position. If this is the case, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated or we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our development and expansion plans or otherwise forego market opportunities.\nTo a large extent, our cash flow generation ability is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our businesses will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before its maturity or obtain additional equity or debt financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on favorable terms, if at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow, refinance our debt or incur additional debt on favorable terms could adversely affect our financial condition and could cause us to be unable to service our debt and may delay or prevent the expansion of our businesses.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nCertain anti-takeover defenses and applicable law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation (which we refer to as our \u201ccharter\u201d), our amended and restated bylaws (which we refer to as our \u201cbylaws\u201d), and Delaware law contain provisions that may delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control of our Company that might involve a premium paid for shares of our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Certain of these provisions are described below.\nSelected provisions of our charter and bylaws. Our charter and/or bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions that:\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and with respect to each such series, to fix the number of shares constituting that series, the powers, rights and preferences of the shares of that series, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions of that series;\n\u2022\nrequire that, subject to the express rights, if any, of the holders of any series of preferred stock, actions to be taken by our stockholders may be taken only at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer, our president, or the majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that our bylaws may be amended by our board of directors without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nprovide that, subject to the express rights, if any, of the holders of any series of preferred stock, directors may be removed from office only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors or newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of our directors may be filled only by a vote of a majority of directors then in office, although less than a quorum;\n\u2022\nprovide that, subject to the express rights, if any, of the holders of any series of preferred stock, any amendment, alteration or repeal of our charter provisions, or the adoption of any new or additional provision, inconsistent with our charter provisions relating to the management of our Company by our board of directors, the calling of special meetings of our stockholders, the prohibition against stockholder action by written consent, and amendment of our charter, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2\u20443% of the voting power of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that the stockholders may amend, alter or repeal our bylaws, or adopt new or additional provisions of our bylaws, only with the affirmative vote of at least 66 2\u20443% of the voting power of our capital stock entitled to vote generally; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice procedures for stockholders to submit nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors and other proposals to be brought before a stockholders meeting.\nSelected provisions of Delaware law. We are a Delaware corporation, and we have elected to be subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (which we refer to as the \u201cDGCL\u201d) by provision of our charter. In general, Section 203 of the DGCL prevents an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (as defined in the DGCL) from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d (as defined in the DGCL) with us for three years following the date that person becomes an interested stockholder unless one or more of the following occurs:\n\u2022\nbefore that person became an interested stockholder, our board of directors approved the transaction in which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder or approved the business combination;\n\u2022\nupon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the interested stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) stock held by directors who are also officers of our Company and by employee stock plans that do not provide employees with the right to determine confidentially whether shares held under the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or\n\u2022\nfollowing the transaction in which that person became an interested stockholder, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2 / 3% of our outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder.\nThe DGCL generally defines \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d as any person who, together with affiliates and associates, is the owner of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or is our affiliate or associate and was the owner of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock at any time within the three-year period immediately before the date of determination.\nTermination of the employment agreements with the members of our management team could be costly and prevent a change in control of the Company.\nThe employment agreements we have entered into with Tyrone Johnson, Nadeem Moiz, Kendall Hoyd and Sunil Palakodati, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President-RDS, and President-ASG, respectively, each provide that if their employment with us terminates under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay them significant amounts of severance compensation, thereby making it costly to terminate their employment. Furthermore, these provisions could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control of the Company that might involve a premium paid for shares of our Class A Common Stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders, which could adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nOur bylaws provide that the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, and further provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur bylaws provide that the state or federal courts located within the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for:\n\u2022\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL;\n\u2022\nany civil action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the provisions of our charter or our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nOur bylaws also provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Furthermore, our bylaws provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities will be deemed to have notice of and consented to the choice of forum provisions of our bylaws described above.\nThese choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholder finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 bylaws has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with one or more actions or proceedings described above, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable. If a court were to find either choice of forum provision in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business and financial condition.\nWe may change our operational policies, investment guidelines and business and growth strategies without stockholder consent, which may subject us to different and more significant risks in the future.\nOur board of directors determines our operational policies, investment guidelines and business and growth strategies. Our board of directors may make changes to, or approve transactions that deviate from, those policies, guidelines and strategies without a vote of, or notice to, our stockholders. Under any of these circumstances, we may expose ourselves to different and more significant risks in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our Class A Common Stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which we refer to as the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, a requirement to present only two years of audited financial statements in the registration statement for the emerging growth company\u2019s initial public offering of common equity securities, an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (which we refer to as the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements pursuant to the rules applicable to smaller reporting companies, no requirement to seek non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements and not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements. We have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements.\nSection 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (which we refer to as the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nWe would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d upon the earliest of (i) December 31, 2023, which is the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of our Class A Common Stock pursuant to our effective registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year during which our annual gross revenues are $1.07 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities, or (iv) as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year (and we have been a public company for at least 12 months and have filed at least one annual report on Form 10-K).\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our Class A Common Stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A Common Stock less attractive as a result of our choices, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe are subject to financial reporting and other requirements as a newly public company for which our accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared.\nAs a public company with listed equity securities, we are required to comply with certain laws, regulations and requirements, including the requirements of the Exchange Act, certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, related regulations of the SEC and requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, with which we were not required to comply as a private company. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting.\nThese reporting and other obligations will place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational, and accounting resources and will cause us to incur significant expenses. We may in the future need to upgrade our information systems or create new systems, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, create or outsource an internal audit function, and hire additional accounting and finance staff. If we are unable to accomplish these objectives in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to design, implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nWe are currently not required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and therefore are not yet required to make an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. However, as a public company, we will be required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. In addition, we will be required to furnish a report by our management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, at the time we file our second annual report on Form 10-K with the SEC, which will be for our year ending December 31, 2019. However, if we continue to take advantage of the exemptions contained in the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC, or the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act and we are an accelerated filer or large accelerated filer within the meaning of Section 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.\nWe are in the process of designing, implementing and testing our internal control over financial reporting, which process is time consuming, costly and complex.\nIf we are unable to design, implement and test our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner or if, in the future, we identify other control deficiencies or material weaknesses in our accounting and financial reporting processes, we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Class A Common Stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the SEC, the Nasdaq Stock Market or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nOperation on multiple Enterprise Resource Planning (which we refer to as \u201cERP\u201d) information systems may negatively impact our operations.\nWe are highly dependent on our information systems infrastructure to process orders, purchase materials, track inventory, ship products in a timely manner, prepare invoices to our customers, maintain internal controls, produce financial data, and otherwise carry on our businesses in the ordinary course. Our RDS segment intends to implement a system that will enhance its ability to scale rapidly, and our ASG segment currently has significant operations on two different ERP platforms. Consequently, both segments have undertaken significant ERP implementation or conversion projects that are intended to be completed in 2019. While we believe we have the experience, skill and management abilities, as well as access to the necessary experts and consultants, to plan and execute these projects without significant disruption to our businesses, ERP implementations and conversions are very complex and inherently subject to risks and uncertainty. There is no assurance that the projects will succeed or that failure in the design, programming, software or implementation will not cause significant disruption to our businesses. Such a disruption could cause project cost overruns, which may be significant, losses in revenue, increases in operating costs, and reduced customer satisfaction, all of which would lead to a decline in profitability over the short term and possibly the long term.\nWe are also in process of implementing appropriate consolidation, analysis and reporting tools to facilitate effective monitoring of business results and variances, enable prompt and accurate financial period closes, and produce the necessary data and reports for board reports, financial statement audits and public company filings. This project is also complex and subject to delays, reporting errors, and the potential inability to effectively close our books and report our results on a timely basis, if at all, which may cause the market to lose confidence in our ability to effectively manage and control our businesses. This may in turn adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our Class A Common Stock.\nChanges in accounting rules, assumptions and/or judgments could materially and adversely affect us.\nAccounting rules and interpretations for certain aspects of our operations are highly complex and involve significant assumptions and judgment. These complexities could lead to a delay in the preparation and dissemination of our financial statements. Furthermore, changes in accounting rules and interpretations or in our accounting assumptions and/or judgments, such as asset impairments, could significantly impact our financial statements. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in restating prior period financial statements. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries.\nWe are a holding company and substantially all of our businesses are conducted through our direct and indirect subsidiaries. We derive all of our operating income from RDS, ASG, and their respective subsidiaries. Other than any cash we may retain, substantially all of our assets will be held by our direct and indirect subsidiaries. We will rely on the earnings and cash flows of RDS, ASG, and their respective subsidiaries.\nWe rely on the earnings and cash flows of our subsidiaries, which are paid to us by our subsidiaries in the form of dividends and other payments or distributions, to meet our debt service and other obligations. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or distributions to us will depend on their respective operating results and may be restricted by, among other things, the laws of their jurisdiction of organization (which may limit the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends and other distributions to us), the terms of existing and future indebtedness and other agreements of our subsidiaries and the covenants of any future outstanding indebtedness that our subsidiaries incur.\nFailure by our directors, officers or employees to comply with applicable codes of conduct could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for our directors, officers and employees. Our adoption of this code and other standards of conduct is not a representation or warranty that all persons subject to this code or standards are or will be in complete compliance. The failure of a director, officer or employee to comply with the applicable code or standards of conduct may result in termination of the relationship and/or adverse publicity, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\nA trading market for our Class A Common Stock may not be sustained and our Class A Common Stock prices could decline.\nAlthough our Class A Common Stock is currently listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cSIC,\u201d an active trading market for the shares of our Class A Common Stock may not be sustained. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the following:\n\u2022\nthe likelihood that an active trading market for shares of our Class A Common Stock will be sustained;\n\u2022\nthe liquidity of any such market;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our stockholders to sell their shares of Class A Common Stock; or\n\u2022\nthe price that our stockholders may obtain for their Class A Common Stock.\nIn addition, the securities markets in general and our Class A Common Stock have experienced price and volume volatility over the past year. The market price and volume of our Class A Common Stock may continue to experience fluctuations not only due to general stock market conditions but also due to government regulatory action, tax laws, interest rates and a change in sentiment in the market regarding our industry, operations or business prospects. In addition to the other risk factors discussed in this section, the price and volume volatility of our Class A Common Stock may be affected by:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nadverse market reaction to the level of our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nactions by stockholders;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity regarding us specifically or our businesses generally;\n\u2022\ngeneral market, economic and political conditions, including an economic slowdown or dislocation in the global credit markets;\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles; and\n\u2022\npassage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or the building products supply and services industry.\nIf an active market is not maintained, or if our Class A Common Stock continues to experience price and volume volatility, the market price of our Class A Common Stock may decline.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our Company, or if they downgrade our Class A Common Stock, the price of our Class A Common Stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A Common Stock could be influenced by any research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our Company. We currently have limited research coverage by securities and industry analysts, with only one analyst covering us. If no other securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our Company, the trading price for our Class A Common Stock could be negatively impacted. In the event one or more securities or industry analysts covering our Company downgrade our Class A Common Stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our Company, our Class A Common Stock price would likely decline. If any of these analysts ceases coverage of our Company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A Common Stock could decrease, which could cause our Class A Common Stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the development and expansion of our businesses and, therefore, do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions contained in any financing instruments and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant in its discretion. Accordingly, you may need to sell your shares of our Class A Common Stock to realize a return on your investment, and you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them, or at all for an indefinite period of time, except as permitted under the Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.\nFuture sales of our Class A Common Stock, other securities convertible into our Class A Common Stock, or our preferred stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, could cause the market value of our Class A Common Stock to decline.\nOur board of directors is authorized, without your approval, to cause us to issue additional shares of our Class A Common Stock or to raise capital through the creation and issuance of preferred stock, other debt securities convertible into our Class A Common Stock, options, warrants and other rights, on terms and for consideration as our board of directors in its sole discretion may determine. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A Common Stock or of preferred stock could cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decrease significantly. We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of our Class A Common Stock or the perception that these sales may occur, or the availability of our Class A Common Stock for future sales, on the value of our Class A Common Stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A Common Stock by any large stockholder, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nFuture offerings of debt securities, which would rank senior to our common stock upon our bankruptcy liquidation, and future offerings of equity securities that may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of dividend and liquidating distributions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making offerings of debt securities or additional offerings of equity securities. Upon bankruptcy or liquidation, holders of our debt securities and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market\nprice of our common stock, or both. Our preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments or both that could limit our ability to pay dividends or make liquidating distributions to the holders of our common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control. As a result, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings, and purchasers of our Class A Common Stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our Class A Common Stock and diluting their ownership interest in our Company.", "PERMNO": 18055, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "SIC"}
