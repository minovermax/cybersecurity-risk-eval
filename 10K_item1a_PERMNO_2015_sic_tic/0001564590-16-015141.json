{"cik": "1095277", "company": "INTERSECTIONS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nWe believe the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are material to an understanding of our company. Any of the following risks as well as other risks and uncertainties discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects and cause the value of our stock to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that are currently deemed immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur revenue decreased significantly in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, and there can be no assurances that our revenue will not continue to decline.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2015, our consolidated revenue declined by approximately 17% from 2014 primarily due to a reduction in subscribers in our Personal Information Services and Insurance and Other Consumer Services segments. The primary reasons for these decreases in revenue and subscribers were the continued termination of marketing for new subscribers by financial institutions and cancellations of subscriber portfolios by certain financial institutions. We expect that in 2016 (and possibly thereafter) we will continue to lose existing subscribers and revenue in both our Personal Information Services and Insurance and Other Consumer Services segments due to a number of factors, including natural attrition and potential actions taken by our financial institution clients or us. We need to replace the revenue from the loss of new and existing subscribers with our other products and services, and there can be no assurances that we will be successful in doing so. Our failure to increase our revenue or grow our profitability likely would continue to adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nWe incurred losses from operations of $43.6 million and $38.4 million in the years ending December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively, and we expect to incur additional losses from operations in 2016 and cannot give assurances of our future profitability.\nWe incurred significant consolidated loss from operations in 2014 and 2015 primarily due to the decline in revenue in our Personal Information Services and Insurance and Other Consumer Services segments and the ongoing costs and expenses of our Pet Health Monitoring segment. We expect in 2016 to continue to incur increased marketing expenses for the launch of VOYCE PRO\u2122, as well as training and other onboarding costs as we continue to develop the sales market over the next twelve months for this segment, which will continue to reduce our profitability in future periods. We cannot assure you that we will not continue to report net losses in future periods.\nWe are dependent upon our Personal Information Services segment for substantially all of our revenue, and our revenue from that segment is expected to continue to decrease, primarily due to the attrition of subscribers obtained through our historical financial institution clients.\nApproximately 92% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2015 was derived from our Personal Information Services segment. We expect to remain dependent on revenue from this segment for the foreseeable future. Our revenue for this segment declined in 2015 by approximately 17% from 2014 as our subscriber base obtained through our historical financial institution clients continues to decline. We have lost subscribers in prior years, and may lose subscribers in future years, due to numerous factors, including changing subscriber preferences; subscriber dissatisfaction; cancellations required by marketing partners, or for regulatory or other reasons; competitive price pressure; recurring billing issues, such as changes to their credit card billing practices or policies; credit card or other billing vehicle declines or turnover, including as a result of a refinancing or account cancellation; and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, our total number of subscribers are expected to continue to decline during 2016. We need to replace the revenue from the loss of new and existing subscribers with our other products and services, and there can be no\nassurances that we will be successful in doing so. Our failure to increase our revenue likely would continue to adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nLaws requiring the free issuance of credit reports by credit reporting agencies, and other services that must be provided by credit reporting agencies, could impede our ability to obtain new subscribers or retain existing subscribers and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act provides consumers the ability to receive one free consumer credit report per year from each major consumer credit reporting agency and requires each major consumer credit reporting agency to provide the consumer a credit score along with the consumer\u2019s credit report for a reasonable fee as determined by the FTC. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and state laws give consumers other rights with respect to the protection of their credit files at the credit reporting agencies. For example, the Fair Credit Reporting Act gives consumers the right to place \u201cfraud alerts\u201d at the credit reporting agencies, and the laws in approximately 40 states give consumers the right to place \u201cfreezes\u201d to block access to their credit files. The rights of consumers to obtain free annual credit reports and credit scores from consumer reporting agencies, and to place fraud alerts and credit freezes directly with them, could cause consumers to perceive that the value of our services is reduced or replaced by those benefits, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe remain dependent on our historical financial institution clients to continue to service and bill a material portion of our subscribers.\nWe historically depended upon our agreements with a small number of financial institutions in the U.S. to derive a significant portion of our revenue. For example, in 2014 and 2015, approximately 66% and 61%, respectively, of our Personal Information Services segment revenue were derived from our agreements with U.S. financial institutions. Under these contracts, our right to continue to service subscribers after termination of a contract by a financial institution varies based on the specific contract terms. Under some contracts, we may continue to provide our services to the existing subscribers, and the financial institution must provide certain applicable services, for varying time periods. Under other contracts, the financial institution may require us at any time to cease providing services under existing subscriptions. Financial institutions under most contracts also may require us to cease providing services to their customers under existing subscriptions if the contract is terminated for material breach by us or based on various events such as certain legal or regulatory changes, a party\u2019s bankruptcy or insolvency, or other events. Even in contracts under which we have a right to continue to provide our services to existing subscribers after termination, we often are substantially dependent on those clients to cooperate in continued servicing, including continued billing by those clients. If those financial institutions do not perform their contractual obligations with respect to the servicing of existing subscribers, or otherwise do not cooperate in our continued servicing of those subscribers, or, where permitted under our contracts, they terminate our servicing of the subscribers, we could lose significant current sources of revenue, and those losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could lose our access to data from any of the three major credit reporting agencies, each of which competes with us, which could cause demand for our services to decrease, affect our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on the major credit reporting agencies, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, in both the U.S. and Canada to provide us with essential credit-related data for our consumer identity theft protection services under short-term agreements. Each of the three major credit reporting agencies competes with us by providing credit information directly to consumers, and may decide to stop supplying data to us on a timely manner or at all, or to significantly increase the costs they charge us for their data. Any change, interruption, deterioration or termination of our relationship with one or more of the three credit reporting agencies would be disruptive to our business and could cause us to lose subscribers or incur increased expenses. We may not be successful in maintaining our relationships on the current terms with the three credit reporting agencies and may not be able to continue to obtain data from them on acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain data from alternative or additional sources if our current sources become unavailable or too costly.\nOur failure to protect private data could cause us to expend capital and resources to protect against future security breaches or other unauthorized access, result in litigation costs, liability and damage to our reputation and business.\nWe collect, distribute and protect nonpublic and sensitive private data in delivering our services. We are subject to the risk that unauthorized users might access that data or human error might cause the wrongful dissemination of that data. If we experience a security breach or other unauthorized access to information, the integrity of our services may be affected. We continue to incur significant costs to protect against security breaches or other mishaps and to minimize problems if a data breach were to occur. Moreover, any public perception that we mishandle private information could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain clients and subscribers, or maintain key supplier relationships, and could subject us to legal claims and liability and damage to our reputation.\nIn addition, unauthorized third parties might alter information in our databases, which would adversely affect both our ability to market our services and the credibility of our information.\nOur business is dependent on the secure operation of our website and systems as well as the operation of the Internet generally. Our business involves the storage and transmission of users\u2019 proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. A number of large Internet companies have disclosed security breaches, some of which have involved intentional attacks. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our financial institution and other clients, or both. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, client, customer and/or supplier perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose clients, customers and/or suppliers. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third party experts and consultants.\nA person who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our subscribers\u2019 proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation and business. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.\nWe rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including customer payment card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction data being breached or compromised. Data breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues.\nUnder payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors and clients, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. In addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines or lose our ability to give customers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or pay their fees. If we were unable to accept payment cards, our business would be seriously damaged.\nOur servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions, including \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d type attacks. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Security breaches, including any breach by us or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of our users\u2019 personal information, could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability.\nMany states have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. Federal and state laws in the U.S. provide for over 45 laws and notification regimes, all of which we are subject to, and additional requirements may be instituted in the future. In the event of a data security breach, these mandatory disclosures often lead to widespread negative publicity. In addition, complying with such numerous and complex regulations in the event of a data security breach is often expensive, difficult and time consuming, and the failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and additional liability and harm our reputation.\nAny actual or perceived security breach, whether successful or not and whether or not attributable to the failure of our services or our information technology systems, as well as our failure to promptly and appropriately react to a breach, would likely harm our reputation, adversely affect market perception of our services, and cause the loss of customers and strategic partners. Our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses or failures that may occur. Our third-party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention.\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges that could materially affect our financial results.\nWe assess our goodwill and other intangible assets as well as our other long-lived assets, including inventory, as and when required by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. to determine whether they are impaired and, if they are, we record appropriate impairment charges. We incurred goodwill impairment charges of $25.8 million and $10.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively, and it is possible that we may be required to record additional significant impairment charges in the future and, if we do so, our operating income could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Credit Agreement provides our lenders with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our assets and contains certain restrictions on our ability to take certain actions. We cannot provide assurance that we will maintain compliance with the financial and other restrictive covenants under our Credit Agreement.\nWe are subject to a number of financial and other restrictive covenants under our Credit Agreement, including covenants with which we have not previously had to comply. These covenants include restrictions that prohibit or otherwise limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock, incur additional indebtedness, make certain investments and other payments, enter into acquisitions, encumber or dispose of assets or engage in certain other types of transactions, and also require that we maintain certain financial ratios and EBITDA levels (as defined in the Credit Agreement and adjusted for certain non-cash, non-recurring and other items) during specified periods. Failure to comply with any of the covenants under our Credit Agreement could result in a default under the facility, which could cause the lenders to declare all obligations immediately due and payable and exercise their lien on substantially all of our assets. We cannot provide assurance that we will maintain compliance with such covenants for future periods, or, if necessary, be able to amend the financial or restrictive covenants contained therein or enter into new credit arrangements to maintain liquidity in the future. In the future, we may take actions including, but not limited to, delaying or forgoing capital investments, reducing marketing or other expenditures compared to current plans, and/or renegotiating or seeking a waiver of the terms of our credit agreement as means of maintaining compliance with these covenants.\nAfter the initial distribution to i4c of a portion of the proceeds from the Credit Agreement, the terms of that financing significantly restrict the ability of i4c to obtain additional debt or equity capital from the Company, investors, lenders or other financing sources. If i4c requires additional funding, these restrictions may have a material adverse effect on the ability of i4c to execute its business plan or take advantage of other business opportunities until such time as the Credit Agreement is fully repaid. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available at all, or on favorable terms, after the Credit Agreement is fully repaid.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses as we enter new businesses, develop new products or increase our consumer direct marketing, which could cause our expenses to increase and our earnings to decline on a quarterly basis.\nWe are continuing to commit significant financial and other resources to our strategic efforts to develop new products and services and increase our consumer direct marketing. For example, we launched VOYCETM in 2015, our new pet health monitoring platform and information management service for pet owners, and expect to launch new identity theft protection, privacy, and health and wellness products and services for consumers, and also intend to invest in increased marketing of our services directly to consumers through our current relationships, our IDENTITY GUARD\u00ae brand and other brands. As a result of the commitments and investments, as well as declining revenue due to a decrease in subscribers from our financial institution clients, we expect our consolidated revenue and earnings to be consistent in 2016. Our continued investment in VOYCETM and the consumer direct business or new investment in other new businesses or products may not be successful in generating future revenue or profits on our projected timeframes or at all.\nAfter launching our Voyce products, we have no material product revenue in our Pet Health Monitoring Segment, and we are continuing to incur substantial expenses.\nWe committed significant resources to the development and launch of VOYCE\u00ae, our new pet health monitoring platform and information management service for pet owners. Voyce is an early stage development entity with a unique product offering, and we experienced certain delays and unforeseen developments with our launch. We may encounter delays or adverse developments in any future product developments of VOYCE\u00ae, which could impede the success of our efforts or result in unforeseen liabilities or expenses. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future for the development of VOYCE\u00ae and any future product candidates we may choose to pursue in this segment. These expenditures will include costs associated with marketing and selling our VOYCE\u00ae product and VOYCE PRO\u2122 service, manufacturing and supply, identifying potential additional product candidates, obtaining regulatory approvals, licensing or acquisition payments and costs associated with research and development activities. We may also incur unanticipated costs. As a result of delays, or for other reasons, including lack of product acceptance, our continued investment in VOYCE\u00ae may not be successful in generating future revenue or profits on our projected timeframe, or at all.\nWe cannot provide assurances that our Voyce products will be successful and gain market acceptance.\nOur Voyce products are new and unique products, and no assurances can be made that they will achieve commercial success. The success of introducing our Voyce products depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nmarket acceptance by veterinarians, industry partners (e.g., pharmaceutical and nutrition companies), retailers, service providers and pet owners of the product as a useful and beneficial product;\n\u00b7\nthe willingness of pet owners to pay for our product and ongoing service relative to other discretionary items;\n\u00b7\ntimely and successful product development;\n\u00b7\nour ability to procure raw materials and parts necessary for the production of our Voyce products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues and supply change management;\n\u00b7\nthe array of complex components, including hardware and software, functioning as intended to provide the anticipated benefits of the service;\n\u00b7\nthe effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand; and\n\u00b7\nthe risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction.\nAs a result, there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market our Voyce products. There also is no assurance that the Voyce products will be well received by customers, nor that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop the Voyce products.\nOur Voyce products are inherently risky because they are based on novel and complex technologies.\nWe are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on new and complex technologies. The novel and complex nature of our Voyce products creates significant challenges with respect to product development and optimization, engineering, manufacturing, scale-up, quality systems, testing, market acceptance, and government regulation and approval. These include:\n\u00b7\nthe time and effort required to solve novel technical problems could delay the production of our Voyce products; and\n\u00b7\nthe uncertainty in our ability to successfully educate veterinarians, industry partners (e.g., pharmaceutical and nutrition companies), retailers, service providers and pet owners about the benefits, administration and use of our product and product candidates could negatively impact market acceptance.\nOur failure to overcome any one of those challenges could harm our business, and overall chances that the Voyce products will work in the intended manner and achieve the desired results.\nWe depend on a single third-party to manufacture our Voyce products and a limited number of third-party suppliers for certain components of the products.\nWe depend on our contract manufacturing arrangements with Sanmina Corporation for the manufacture of our Voyce products and the sourcing of substantially all of our components and raw materials. Pursuant to our contract, Sanmina principally manufactures our Voyce products, pursuant to our specifications at one of its facilities. Sanmina may terminate this relationship upon 90 days\u2019 written notice, or earlier under certain circumstances. If our arrangements with Sanmina are terminated for any reason or if we otherwise determine to engage an alternative manufacturer, the process of moving our manufacturing activities would be time consuming and costly, and may limit our ability to meet our sales commitments, which could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFor our business strategy to be successful, Sanmina must be able to manufacture our Voyce products in sufficient quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements and quality control standards, in accordance with agreed upon specifications, at acceptable costs and on a timely basis. Our Voyce products are difficult to manufacture due to the complexity of the design and the fact that the products contain over 100 component parts. Sanmina\u2019s ability to meet manufacture demands may be hampered by unforeseen difficulties in production that arise due to the complexity of the Voyce products. In addition, increases in our product sales, whether forecasted or unanticipated, could strain the ability of Sanmina to manufacture an increasingly large supply of our current or future Voyce products in a manner that meets these various requirements.\nWe also rely on third-party suppliers, which typically contract directly with Sanmina, to supply certain components of our Voyce products. Sanmina\u2019s ability to secure adequate quantities of such product components on our behalf may be impacted by factors beyond Sanmina\u2019s and our control, including any supplier\u2019s financial difficulties, weather conditions, labor strikes, raw material shortages, import and export issues, and damage to their manufacturing equipment or facilities. If Sanmina fails to obtain sufficient quantities of high quality components to meet demand on a timely basis, we could lose customer orders, our reputation could be harmed and our business could be impacted by delays in assembly and shipping of final product.\nSanmina aggregates the components of VOYCE\u00ae and VOYCE PRO\u2122 from a large number of suppliers and assembles the Voyce Health Monitor and overall product at its Kenosha, Wisconsin facility. If any one of more of the suppliers ceases to provide sufficient quantities of components in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, this could limit our ability to timely meet our sales\ncommitments, which could harm our reputation and could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, we are evaluating alternatives for final assembly and fulfillment service for future product generations, including third party providers and in house operations.\nDefects in our Voyce products or the software that accompanies it could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of our Voyce products involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, unanticipated use of the products, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of the products can lead to injury or other adverse events for the pet and the pet owner. In addition, because the manufacturing of our products is outsourced to Sanmina, our original equipment manufacturer, we may not be aware of manufacturing defects that could occur. Such adverse events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or required by any applicable governmental authorities), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of our Voyce products from the market. A recall could result in significant costs. To the extent any manufacturing defect occurs, our agreement with Sanmina contains a limitation on Sanmina\u2019s liability, and we could therefore be required to incur the majority of related costs. Product defects or recalls could also result in negative publicity, damage to our reputation or, in some circumstances, delays in new product approvals. We may as part of our ordinary course of business be subject to product liability claims alleging defects in the design, manufacture or labeling of our Voyce products. A product liability claim, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could result in significant legal defense costs and high damage payments. Although we maintain product liability insurance, the coverage is subject to deductibles and limitations, and may not be adequate to cover future claims. Additionally, we may be unable to maintain our existing product liability insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or adequate amounts.\nIn addition, our Voyce products incorporate sophisticated computer software. Complex software frequently contains errors, especially when first introduced. Our software may experience errors or performance problems in the future. As with any consumer electronic product, users may use our Voyce products not in accordance with safety protocols and training, which could enhance the risk of harm or injury. Any such occurrence could cause delay in market acceptance of our Voyce products, damage to our reputation, additional regulatory filings, product recalls, increased service and warranty costs, product liability claims and loss of revenue relating to such hardware or software defects.\nWe rely on an exclusive third-party license for certain essential aspects of our Voyce products and services. Failure to maintain this license agreement could prevent us from continuing to develop and commercialize our Voyce products.\nOur Voyce products and service are dependent on a perpetual, worldwide, exclusive license for non-human application of ultra-wideband technologies for sensing and monitoring vital signs, including heart rate and respiration, from LifeWave Biosciences. This intellectual property is essential for the operation of our Voyce products and service. This license imposes certain obligations upon us, including an obligation to make royalty payments to LifeWave Biosciences in the future, once certain thresholds are reached, on certain sales of licensed products. If we are unable to maintain the exclusivity of the license agreement or fail to comply with our obligations under the license agreement, we could lose license rights that are essential to this business, and there is a strong possibility that we will be unable to continue to develop and commercialize our Voyce products and service in the manner and on the timeframe we currently anticipate. In addition, in the event of bankruptcy proceedings relating to LifeWave Biosciences or the then owner of the licensed intellectual property, the bankruptcy trustee may attempt to reject the license, or a bankruptcy court may refuse to uphold the license or certain of its terms or may permit the intellectual property to be assigned to a third-party. The loss or material impairment of our license rights to the ultra-wideband technologies could substantially harm our business.\nWe currently have limited in-house sales capabilities for our Voyce products. If we are unable to establish sales capabilities on our own or through third parties, we may not be able to effectively market and sell our Voyce products or generate product revenue.\nWe are continuing to build an in-house sales organization. In order to commercialize our Voyce products in the U.S. and any jurisdictions outside the U.S., we must build our marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. In 2015, we entered into an agreement with Patterson Veterinary, a market-leading supplier of animal health products, technology and other services, to exclusively distribute our VOYCE PRO\u2122 product throughout the veterinary community. We expect our revenue to come from product and service sales through industry and veterinarian partners that market, sell or recommend our Voyce products and service. We have no prior experience in the marketing, sale and distribution of pet monitoring devices and pet health services, and there are risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our ability to recruit the correct talent, create the right marketing message and generate sufficient sales leads, as well as provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, and effectively oversee a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. Any failure or delay in these areas could adversely impact the commercialization of these products. If we are not successful in commercializing our Voyce products, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more industry partners, our future product revenue would suffer.\nWe are substantially dependent on third party suppliers and service providers, and our clients and their service providers, to market and provide our products, and failures by those third parties or our clients could harm our business and prospects.\nOur consumer products and services are substantially dependent on third party suppliers, including providers of credit and other data, analytics, and software and other technology. Our failure to develop and maintain these third party relationships could harm our ability to provide our products and services. We also rely on various third party service providers, including outsourced telemarketing vendors, customer service providers, network and systems hosts and other providers. In some arrangements we rely on our clients or their service providers, including the marketing of products, billing of subscribers and customer service.\nFailure of any of our third party suppliers or service providers, or our clients or their service providers, to satisfy our contracts or requirements, or to comply with applicable laws and regulations, could cause us to lose subscribers or clients, expose us to private lawsuits or governmental investigations or proceedings, cause us to be liable for damages and fines, or harm our reputation. Any such event could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nA failure of any of the insurance companies that underwrite the insurance products or related benefits provided as part of our insurance services, or refusal by those insurance companies to provide the expected insurance, could harm our business.\nCertain of our insurance services include or depend on insurance products, or are dependent on group insurance policies under which the customers for our services are the insureds. The current and expected economic climate may cause financial instability among one or more of those insurance companies. Any failure of any of those insurance companies, or refusal by them to provide the expected insurance, could require us to remove the affected insurance from our services, cause us to lose customers or clients, or expose us to liability claims by our customers or clients.\nIf we experience system failures or interruptions in our telecommunications or information technology infrastructure, our revenue could decrease and our reputation could be harmed.\nOur operations depend upon our ability to protect our telecommunications and information technology systems against damage or system interruptions from natural disasters, technical failures and other events beyond our control. We receive credit and other data electronically, and this delivery method is susceptible to damage, delay or inaccuracy. A significant portion of our business involves telephonic customer service as well as mailings, both of which depend upon the data generated from our computer systems. Unanticipated problems with our telecommunications and information technology systems may result in a significant system outage or data loss, which could interrupt our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business, including the loss of revenue, clients or customers or exposure to liability claims.\nWe may launch products and services in fields and markets that are new to us, and may be exposed to new risks that could impede the success of our efforts or result in unforeseen liabilities or expenses.\nOur Voyce products require the manufacturing and distribution of consumer electronics products, which is not a form of product creation or distribution in which we previously have engaged. As a result, we have been required to learn and comply with laws and regulations that are new to us, and manage risks that are new to us, including manufacturing supply chain management and product distribution. We also are exploring or developing other new products and services, including new privacy and insurance products, which also may involve new risks. If we are unable to manage these new risks, our efforts to develop and launch new products and services may not be successful, or we may incur unforeseen liabilities or expenses, including product liability, regulatory violation, intellectual property infringement or contract claims, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe could be unable to meet our future capital requirements to grow our business, which could adversely impact our financial condition and growth strategy.\nWe could need to continue to raise additional funds in the future in order to operate and expand our business. Our ability to meet our future capital requirements and grow our business by investing in and marketing our products and services, including our VOYCE\u00ae pet health monitoring platform and information management service, could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to maintain compliance with the covenants under our Credit Agreement or otherwise obtain financing in the future. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate one or more of our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts. Our inability to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may lose subscribers and customers and significant revenue if our existing products and services become obsolete, or if we fail to introduce new products and services with broad appeal or fail to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nOur growth depends upon developing and successfully introducing new products and services that generate client and consumer interest, including new data sources, advanced tools and analytical capabilities, more timely notification of activities and more useable content. We have made or may make significant investments in these new products and services, including development costs and prepayment of royalties and fees to third party providers. Although we have a limited history of developing and introducing products and services outside the areas of identity theft protection and consumer credit information, we are currently developing or introducing new products and services in other areas. Our failure to develop, introduce or expand successfully our products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nWe depend on key members of our management and other key personnel.\nWe depend on key members of our management. We do not maintain key person life insurance on our senior management. Loss of one or more of these key individuals, particularly our chairman and chief executive officer or other executive officers, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We also believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract, retain and motivate skilled managerial, marketing and other personnel, and a failure to attract and retain those personnel may have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe may not be able to consummate acquisitions or investments that are accretive or which improve our financial condition.\nA component of our strategy may include selectively acquiring assets or businesses or making strategic investments in order to increase cash flow and earnings or diversify or expand our product offerings. This depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to identify acceptable acquisition or investment candidates, consummate transactions on favorable terms, successfully integrate acquired assets and obtain financing to support our growth and expansion, and many other factors beyond our control. We may encounter delays or other problems or incur substantial expenses in connection with seeking acquisitions that could negatively impact our operating results. In connection with any acquisitions or investments, we could issue stock that would dilute our stockholders, incur substantial debt, assume known, contingent and unknown liabilities and/or reduce our cash reserves. In addition, legal or regulatory requirements, availability of financing or other factors may prevent us from consummating acquisitions of membership agreements or customer portfolios offered by our clients, which may have an adverse impact on our relationships with those clients or our continued receipt of revenue from those portfolios or agreements. Acquisitions may also require material infrequent charges and could result in adverse tax consequences, impairment of goodwill, substantial depreciation and amortization, increased interest expense, deferred compensation charges, and the amortization of amounts related to deferred compensation and identifiable purchased intangible assets, any of which could negatively impact our results of operations in one or more future periods.\nWe may not realize planned benefits of our Health At Work or White Sky acquisitions or other acquisitions or investments, including from any membership agreement or other customer portfolio acquisitions.\nIn connection with our acquisitions, including the Health At Work and White Sky acquisitions in 2015, we may experience unforeseen operating difficulties as we continue to integrate the acquired assets and businesses into our existing operations. These difficulties may require significant management attention and financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations. Any acquisition or investments by us involves risks, including:\n\u00b7\nunexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of the acquired operations;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in integrating the financial, technological and management standards, processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations;\n\u00b7\nchallenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n\u00b7\nestablishing the internal controls and procedures that we are required to maintain under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and\n\u00b7\nmitigating contingent or assumed liabilities or unexpected costs.\nIn addition, we may acquire membership agreements or other customer portfolios from our clients or others. Although we receive certain representations, warranties and covenants from the seller, we have no guarantee that attrition of customers will not exceed expected levels for reasons that do not require the seller to indemnify us. If attrition exceeds our expectations, the revenue expected from these portfolios or membership agreements otherwise is less than we expected, or our costs of servicing these customers are higher than we expected, we may lose some or all of our investment.\nOur Canadian business exposes us to operational, economic and currency risks.\nOur Canadian operations represented approximately 13% and 9% of our consolidated revenue in 2014 and 2015, respectively, and a component of our strategy includes expanding and adding to our marketing partner relationships in Canada. Our ability to successfully conduct operations in Canada is affected by many of the same risks we face in our U.S. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing Canadian operations. Our growth in Canada has made us subject to Canadian economic conditions, particularly currency exchange rate fluctuations, increased regulations, quotas, tariffs, and political factors, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations as our Canadian operations continue to expand. Further, we may be exposed to new forms of competition not present in our domestic markets, as well as subject to potentially different demographic tastes and preferences for our products.\nCompetition could reduce our market share or decrease our revenue.\nWe operate in highly competitive businesses. Our competitors may provide products and services comparable or superior to those provided by us, or at lower prices, adapt more quickly to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements, increase their emphasis on products and services similar to ours, enter the markets in which we operate or introduce competing products and services. Any of these factors could reduce our market share or decrease our revenue. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. Several of our competitors offer products and services that are similar to, or that directly compete with, our products and services. Competition for new subscribers for our products and services is also intense. We also compete directly with the credit reporting agencies that control the credit file data that we use to provide our services. One or more of these credit reporting agencies may not make available to us or our customers the same features that they may offer in direct competition with us.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nOur Personal Information Services segment and Insurance and Other Consumer Services segments are subject to a wide range of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Personal Information Services and Insurance and Other Consumer Services segments are subject to a wide variety of U.S. federal and state laws and regulations. Our business in Canada is subject to similar laws. For additional information on the laws and regulations that may have an effect on our business, see \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation\u201d above.\nMany of the laws in the U.S. and Canada that apply to us or our clients are the subject of revision and addition, the issuance of rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations by government agencies, and rulings and interpretations by courts and other tribunals. We incur significant costs to operate our business in compliance with these laws and regulations, and to make changes to our business as needed to comply with legal and regulatory changes. We have made and may continue to make changes to our business and operations as a result of changes with respect to these laws or regulations. These changes have increased our costs and reduced our revenue, and we may make further changes that have such effect. Further, scrutiny of the sales, marketing and administration of add-on products by financial institution and financial product regulators has resulted in the termination of almost all marketing of our products by financial institutions and cancellation of certain subscribers. The effect of this combination of laws, regulations, reviews and proceedings is difficult to estimate, and any or a combination of them, or changes to them, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe and our clients are subject to legal actions and proceedings, including consumer class action litigation and government agency investigations and enforcement actions, which could require us to incur substantial expenses, pay damages, fines and penalties, lose subscribers and clients, and change our business practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause we operate in highly regulated industries and must comply with various foreign, federal, state and local laws, we may be subject to claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. These legal actions may include private class action lawsuits, and investigations and enforcement actions by governmental authorities. We cannot predict the outcome of any actions or proceedings, and the cost of responding to investigations or claims and defending against private actions, investigations or government enforcement actions might be material. If we are found liable in any actions or proceedings, or are required to indemnify our clients or others for their expenses or liability, we may have to pay substantial damages, fines and penalties, lose subscribers or clients, suffer harm to our reputation, and be required change the way we conduct our business, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as a result of these investigations, proceedings or actions, or other regulatory oversight, our financial institution clients have taken, and we may take, remedial actions including the issuing of refunds and/or cancellation of subscribers, and our clients may seek indemnification or contribution from us relating to those remedial\nactions, which could require us to incur substantial expenses, pay damages, fines and penalties, lose subscribers and clients, and change our business practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flow.\nWe believe that the CFPB, along with other federal agencies including the OCC, are continuing to review policies and practices of financial institutions and their service providers with respect to add-on or ancillary products. The CFPB, OCC and FDIC have entered into public consent orders with Bank of America and several other financial institutions with respect to such products, including in some cases our identity theft protection products. Under these consent orders, financial institutions have agreed, among other things, to make restitution of fees collected from their customers, take other remedial actions, and cease marketing of the applicable products until their compliance plans are approved by regulators, and pay penalties. We believe these governmental reviews of products marketed through financial institutions are continuing, and may include reviews by state government agencies. One or more financial institutions may seek indemnification from us, and we or the financial institutions may be subject to enforcement proceedings or private class actions. We may receive requests for information directly from federal or state agencies. We provided information to the CFPB in response to the previously reported Civil Investigative Demand regarding the provision of \u201cancillary products related to credit card or deposit accounts\u201d and a subsequent request for voluntary production of information received in January 2014. In July 2015, a consent order with the CFPB was entered in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. We agreed to make various changes to our disclosures and business practices. We also agreed under the consent order to be subject to certain ongoing injunctive relief and other compliance requirements, which we do not believe substantially changes our existing practices or business but may result in us incurring additional costs associated with compliance or redress. Based on the entry of the consent order, we incurred additional penalties expense of $600 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, we paid the total penalty amount of $1.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, and in February 2016 we paid the remaining $63 thousand of refunds to 661 subscribers.\nWe may continue to incur material costs as a result of any other regulatory review and scrutiny, or class action litigation, which could reduce the operating results of our Personal Information Services or Insurance and Other Consumer Services segments and our cash flows provided by operations. Any finding that we have violated a law or regulation, filing of an enforcement action or class action litigation against us, or entry by us into a consent order or settlement may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nJudicial decisions, CFPB rule-making or amendments to the Federal Arbitration Act could render the arbitration agreements the Company uses illegal or unenforceable.\nThe Company includes arbitration provisions in its consumer agreements and terms of use. These provisions are designed to allow the Company to resolve any customer disputes through individual arbitration rather than in court and explicitly provide that all arbitrations will be conducted on an individual and not on a class basis. Thus, the Company\u2019s arbitration agreements, if enforced, have the effect of shielding the Company from class action liability. The Company\u2019s arbitration agreements do not generally have any impact on regulatory enforcement proceedings. The Company takes the position that the arbitration provisions in its consumer agreements and terms of use, including class action waivers, are valid and enforceable; however, the enforceability of arbitration provisions is often challenged in court. If those challenges are successful, the Company\u2019s arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be unenforceable, which could subject the Company to additional litigation, including additional class action litigation. In addition, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would generally limit or prohibit mandatory arbitration agreements in consumer contracts. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the CFPB to study consumer arbitration and report to the U.S. Congress, and it authorizes the CFPB to adopt rules limiting or prohibiting consumer arbitration, consistent with the results of its study. In 2013, the CFPB released a preliminary report on consumer arbitration provisions and indicated further study was in process. The results of the CFPB\u2019s further study on arbitration were released in a report to Congress in March 2015. The report, which the CFPB states is an empirical study and not an evaluative study, sets forth the CFPB\u2019s factual findings from its comprehensive empirical review of the facts surrounding the resolution of consumer disputes - both in arbitration and in the courts. In October 2015, the CFPB announced that it is considering proposing rules that would directly affect arbitration clauses that include class action waivers. Although this announcement is only the first step in the rulemaking process, the CFPB proposal, as currently explained, would ban companies from including arbitration clauses that block class action lawsuits in consumer contracts, including the Company\u2019s consumer agreements and terms of use. The proposal would not ban arbitration provisions in their entirety, but the provisions would have to explain that they would not apply to cases filed as class actions unless the class certification is denied or dismissed by the court. Any rule adopted by the CFPB would apply to arbitration agreements entered into more than six months after the final rule becomes effective (and not to prior arbitration agreements). Any judicial decisions, legislation or other rules or regulations that impair the Company\u2019s ability to enter into and enforce consumer arbitration agreements and class action waivers could significantly increase the Company\u2019s exposure to class action litigation as well as litigation in plaintiff-friendly jurisdictions, which would be costly and could have a material adverse effect.\nLiabilities we establish or charges we incur for private or governmental legal proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nWe periodically analyze currently available information about current legal proceedings and make a determination of the probability of loss and provide a range of possible loss when we believe that sufficient and appropriate information is available. We accrue a liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated but no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount in the range, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not accrue a liability when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is believed to be probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the likelihood that a liability has been incurred is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and the impact could potentially be material, we disclose the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss.\nWe may determine in the future that we must establish a reserve or incur a charge for all or a portion of our legal proceedings for which we did not previously establish a reserve or take a charge. We also may determine that we are required to increase a reserve if we determine that the reserve we previously established was inadequate, or record an additional charge if we incur liabilities in excess of liabilities that we have previously recorded. Such charges or liabilities could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to assertions that taxes must be collected based on sales and use of our services in various states, which could expose us to liability and cause material harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrently, our products and services are subject to sales and use taxes in certain states to which we are currently compliant, and taxability is generally determined by statutory state laws and regulations, as well as our assessment of nexus. Whether sales of our services are subject to additional states\u2019 sales and use taxes is uncertain, due in part to the nature of our services and the relationships through which our services are offered, as well as changing state laws and interpretations of those laws. One or more additional states may seek to impose sales or use tax or other tax collection obligations on us, whether based on sales by us or our resellers or clients, including for past sales. A successful assertion that we should be collecting sales or other related taxes on our services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, discourage clients from offering or billing for our services, or otherwise cause material harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf our efforts to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property related to our current or future products and services, including our IDENTITY GUARD\u00ae brand and VOYCE\u00ae product, are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property, including our IDENTITY GUARD\u00ae brand and VOYCE\u00ae pet wellness product. We rely upon a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret protection, confidentiality and license agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our current products and services. However, these measures afford only limited protection and might be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. The measures we take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and in some instances we have not undertaken comprehensive searches with respect to certain of our intellectual property. We have limited protections in countries outside the U.S., such as registrations for key trademarks. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop similar intellectual property.\nMethod-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, veterinarians may recommend that pet owners use these products off-label, or pet owners may do so themselves. Although off-label use may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute.\nOur patents may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our patents. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents we own, in-license or pursue with respect to any of our current or future products and services is threatened, it could threaten our ability to commercialize any of our current or future products and services.\nWe also rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our product development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. Although we require all of our employees to assign their inventions to us, and endeavor to execute confidentiality agreements with all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology, we cannot be certain that we have executed\nsuch agreements with all parties who may have helped to develop our intellectual property or had access to our proprietary information, nor that our agreements will not be breached. We cannot guarantee that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, we will not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential proprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in our market.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which may be costly to defend, could require the payment of damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.\nCompanies in the Internet, technology, data management, wireless communications, wearable technology and other industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The technologies we own or license from others may not be able to withstand challenge by the owners of any third-party claims or rights. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming, and expensive to litigate or settle, and could divert management resources and attention. An adverse determination also could prevent us from offering our products and services to others and may require that we procure substitute products or services for these customers and clients and could require us to pay damages, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWith respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to pay damages or stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights. We may have to seek a license for the technology, which may not be available on reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. The technology also may not be available for license to us at all. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense. If we cannot license or develop technology for the infringing aspects of our business, we may be forced to limit our product and service offerings and may be unable to compete effectively.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other technology companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise improperly used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nOur commercial success will depend, in part, on obtaining and maintaining patent protection for our products.\nAlthough we have obtained, and will continue to seek to obtain and maintain, intellectual property rights for our Voyce products and hold a perpetual, worldwide, exclusive license for non-human application of certain technology used in the pet health monitoring product, our patents and intellectual property rights may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around their claims. If we cannot prosecute or enforce our licensed patents for any reason, including as a result of recent patent reform legislation, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be adversely affected.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our licensors that are licensed to us. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, if we or one of our future collaborators were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering our current products and services, or one of our future products or services, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the U.S. PTO, or made a materially misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the U.S. PTO, even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our current or future product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nLitigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be unsuccessful, it could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Finally, we may not be able to prevent, alone or with the support of our licensors, misappropriation of our trade secrets or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the U.S.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents, trademarks and copyrights on products throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent, trademark or copyright protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent, trademark or copyright protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued or licensed patents, trademarks or copyrights and our intellectual property claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly over a short period of time.\nThe trading price of our common stock is volatile with trading prices ranging from $1.92 per share to $8.60 per share since January 1, 2014. In the past, our stock price has declined in response to period-to-period fluctuations in our revenue, expenses and operating results. In certain periods where our historical operating results have been below the expectations of analysts and investors, the price of our common stock has decreased significantly following earnings announcements. In addition, our stock price may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7\nthe timing and rate of subscription cancellations and additions;\n\u00b7\nthe decrease in our revenue and subscriber base in 2015 and the anticipated continued reduction in our revenue in 2016;\n\u00b7\nour continued losses from operations;\n\u00b7\nthe loss of a key client or a change by a key client in the servicing of our products and services;\n\u00b7\nenforcement actions or other proceedings against us or our client;\n\u00b7\nthe success (or lack thereof) of our Voyce products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to introduce new and improve existing products and services on a timely basis;\n\u00b7\nthe success of competing products and services by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nthe demand for consumer subscription services generally;\n\u00b7\namount and frequency of future dividend payments and share repurchases, if any;\n\u00b7\nour ability to generate and maintain cash flows provided by operations, including our ability to secure any additional debt or equity financing;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of third parties to support our services; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions.\nWe do not expect to declare or pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since the first quarter of 2014. Because we currently intend to retain all cash we generate to fund the growth of our business and our Credit Agreement currently prohibits us from declaring and paying\nordinary cash dividends, we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. As a result, if we do not declare or pay dividends you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nInsiders have substantial control over us and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control, which may harm the market price of our common stock.\nLoeb Holding Corp., which is controlled by one of our directors, owns approximately 42% of our outstanding common stock; Osmium Partners, which is controlled by another of our directors, owns approximately 14% of our outstanding common stock; and Michael R. Stanfield, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns an additional approximately 7% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, our other executive officers and other directors collectively own significant shares of our outstanding common stock, and these insiders may acquire additional shares of common stock or other securities in the future. These stockholders may have interests that conflict with the other public stockholders. If these stockholders act together, they could have the ability to significantly influence or control the management and affairs of our company and potentially determine the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any sale of the Company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may harm the market price of our common stock by delaying, discouraging or preventing a change in control transaction.\nIf we sell shares of our common stock in future financings, stockholders may experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nWe may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the current trading price of our common stock. As a result, our stockholders would experience immediate dilution upon the sale of any shares of our common stock at such discount. In addition, as opportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future, including the issuance of debt securities, preferred stock or common stock. If we issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock, our common stockholders would experience additional dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and are taking advantage of certain reduced governance and disclosure requirements, including that our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot be certain if the omission of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nCurrently, we are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d meaning that our outstanding common stock held by nonaffiliates had a value of less than $75 million. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our auditors are not required to attest to the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. As a result, investors and others may become less comfortable with the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal controls and the risk that material weakness or other deficiencies in internal controls go undetected may increase. In addition, as a smaller reporting company, we intend to take advantage of our ability to provide certain other less comprehensive disclosures in our SEC filings, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports and simplified executive compensation disclosures. Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects, as the information we provide to stockholders may be different from what you might receive from other public companies in which you hold shares.", "PERMNO": 90129, "SIC": 7323, "TIC": "INTX"}
