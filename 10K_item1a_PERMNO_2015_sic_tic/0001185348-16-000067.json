{"cik": "1185348", "company": "PRA GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our Company involves risk, including the possibility that the value of the investment could fall substantially. The following are risks that could materially affect our financial results and condition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in our Company.\nRisks related to our operations and industry\nA prolonged economic recovery or deterioration in the economic or inflationary environment in North America or Europe may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur performance may be affected by economic or inflationary conditions in any market in which we operate. Economic conditions may be impacted by domestic conditions or by global political and economic conditions such as the sovereign debt crises experienced in several European countries and the uncertainty on the future of the European Union. Deterioration in economic conditions, a prolonged economic recovery, or a significant rise in inflation could cause personal bankruptcy and insolvency filings to increase, and the ability of consumers to pay their debts could be adversely affected. This may in turn adversely impact our financial results. Deteriorating economic conditions or a prolonged recovery could also adversely impact the businesses and governmental entities to which we provide fee-based services, which could reduce our fee income and cash flow.\nIf global credit market conditions and the stability of global banks deteriorate, it could negatively impact the generation of comprehensive receivable buying opportunities and our business, financial performance, and ability to succeed in foreign markets could be adversely affected. If conditions in major credit markets deteriorate, the amount of consumer or commercial lending and financing could be reduced, thus decreasing the amount of potentially purchasable defaulted receivables which we depend on for our operations.\nOther factors associated with the economy that could influence our performance include the financial stability of the lenders on our line of credit and our access to capital and credit. The financial turmoil which affected the banking system and financial markets in recent years resulted in a tightening in the credit markets. There could be a number of follow-on effects from the financial turmoil on our business, including a decrease in the value of our financial investments and the insolvency of lending institutions, including the lenders on our line of credit, resulting in our difficulty in or inability to obtain credit. These and other economic factors could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to continually replace our defaulted receivables with additional receivables portfolios sufficient to operate efficiently and profitably, and/or we may not be able to purchase defaulted receivables at appropriate prices.\nTo operate profitably, we must acquire and service a sufficient amount of defaulted receivables to generate revenue that exceeds our expenses. Fixed costs such as salaries and other compensation expense constitute a significant portion of our overhead and, if we do not replace the defaulted receivables portfolios we service with additional portfolios, we may have to reduce the number of our collection personnel. We would then have to rehire collection staff if we subsequently obtain additional defaulted receivables portfolios. These practices could lead to:\n\u2022\nlow employee morale;\n\u2022\nfewer experienced employees;\n\u2022\nhigher training costs;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in our operations;\n\u2022\nloss of efficiency; and\n\u2022\nexcess costs associated with unused space in our facilities.\nThe availability of receivables portfolios at prices which generate an appropriate return on our investment depends on a number of factors both within and outside of our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe continuation of high levels of consumer debt obligations;\n\u2022\nsales of defaulted receivables portfolios by debt owners; and\n\u2022\ncompetitive factors affecting potential purchasers and credit grantors of receivables.\nFurthermore, heightened regulation of the credit card and consumer lending industry or changing credit origination strategies may result in decreased availability of credit to consumers, potentially leading to a future reduction in defaulted consumer\nreceivables available for purchase from debt owners. We cannot predict how our ability to identify and purchase receivables and the quality of those receivables would be affected if there were a shift in consumer lending practices, whether caused by changes in the regulations or accounting practices applicable to debt owners, a sustained economic downturn or otherwise.\nMoreover, there can be no assurance that debt owners will continue to sell their defaulted receivables at recent levels or at all, or that we will be able to continue to offer competitive bids for defaulted receivables portfolios. Because of the length of time involved in collecting defaulted receivables on acquired portfolios and the variability in the timing of our collections, we may not be able to identify trends and make changes in our purchasing strategies in a timely manner. If we are unable to expand our business or adapt to changing market needs as well as our current or future competitors, we may experience reduced access to defaulted receivables portfolios at appropriate prices and reduced profitability.\nCurrently, a number of large banks that historically sold defaulted consumer debt in the United States are out of the debt sale market. This includes sellers of bankrupt accounts, some of whom feel that regulatory guidance concerning sales of bankruptcy accounts has been ambiguous. Should these conditions worsen, it could negatively impact our ability to replace our receivables with additional portfolios sufficient to operate profitably.\nWe utilize third-party vendors for many services, including the judicial collection of certain accounts. Should they fail to adhere to regulatory requirements, it could negatively impact our business.\nWe depend on third-party vendors for a wide array of services, systems and applications, including the collection of accounts through the legal channel. If one of our vendors fails to adhere to applicable regulatory requirements, their failure could negatively impact our business and could subject us to litigation and regulatory risk. Management implemented a formal vendor management governance program in 2014 which outlines certain processes intended to mitigate risks involved with third-party vendors. These processes include but are not limited to due diligence and risk assessment for material vendors; specific contractual requirements, ongoing oversight of our vendors and vendor performance reporting. Some of our service providers are subject to the CFPB's supervisory and enforcement authority, which includes on-site examination of their operations and the CFPB's authority to make findings of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices. Violations of federal consumer financial protection laws by our service providers could result in our legal responsibility for their actions.\nA portion of our collections depends on success in individual lawsuits. Additionally, in pursuing legal collections, we may be unable to obtain accurate and authentic account documents for accounts that we purchase, and despite our quality control measures, we cannot be certain that all of the documents we provide are error free.\nA portion of our collections on accounts is achieved through the legal channel. Accordingly, a percentage of our future collections is dependent on success in individual lawsuits, and a portion of those are dependent on the success of third-party attorney firms. In addition, when we collect accounts judicially, certain legal and regulatory requirements, as well as courts in certain jurisdictions require that a copy of certain account documents be attached to the pleadings in order to obtain a judgment against the account debtors. If we are unable to produce accurate and authentic account documents, these courts will deny our claims. We rely on the debt owners that we purchase from to fulfill their contractual obligations, and if applicable, to provide account documents to us in an accurate and timely fashion. Our inability to obtain these documents from the debt owners may negatively impact the liquidation rate on such accounts that are subject to judicial collections. Additionally, our ability to collect non-judicially may be negatively impacted by orders, laws or regulations which require that certain types of account documentation be in our possession prior to the institution of any collection activities.\nWe may not be able to collect sufficient amounts on our defaulted receivables to fund our operations.\nOur principal business consists of acquiring and liquidating receivables that consumers have failed to pay and that the credit grantor has deemed uncollectible and has charged-off. The debt owners have typically made numerous attempts to recover on their defaulted receivables, often using a combination of in-house recovery efforts and third-party collection agencies. These defaulted receivables are difficult to collect and we may not collect a sufficient amount to cover our investment and the costs of running our business.\nWe may not be successful at acquiring and collecting receivables of new asset types.\nWe may pursue the acquisition of receivables portfolios of new asset types, and in countries in which we have little current experience. We may not be successful in completing acquisitions of receivables of these asset types or in these countries, and our limited experience in these asset types and in these countries may impair our ability to collect on these receivables. This may cause us to pay too much for these receivables and, consequently, we may not generate a profit from these receivables portfolio acquisitions.\nOur collections may decrease if certain types of insolvency proceedings and bankruptcy filings involving liquidations increase.\nVarious economic trends and potential changes to existing legislation may contribute to an increase in the amount of personal bankruptcy and insolvency filings. Under certain of these filings a debtor's assets may be sold to repay creditors, but because most of the receivables we collect through our collections operations are unsecured, we typically would not be able to collect on those receivables. Although our insolvency collections business could benefit from an increase in personal bankruptcies and insolvencies, we cannot ensure that our operations collections business would not decline with an increase in personal insolvencies or bankruptcy filings or changes in related regulations or practices. If our actual collection experience with respect to a defaulted or insolvent bankrupt consumer receivables portfolio is significantly lower than the total amount we projected when we purchased the portfolio, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIncreases in insurance costs or limitations in insurance coverage may adversely impact our operations and financial results.\nWe purchase insurance to cover potential risks and liabilities, including, but not limited to, property and casualty insurance, cyber risk insurance, general liability insurance, directors' and officers' insurance and errors and omissions liability insurance. The premiums that we pay for our insurance coverage may increase significantly, thereby increasing our costs. Also, our insurance does not cover all potential losses, costs or liabilities that we may incur; the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us could exceed available insurance coverage; and some policies may carry high deductibles, limits on liability or exclusions, causing us to self-insure a portion of our liabilities. Additionally, our insurance carriers may in the future decline to provide insurance coverage to us. If we do not have sufficient insurance to cover the full amount of claims against us and we are found liable for a substantial uninsured claim, we could suffer losses and may be forced to expend a significant amount to resolve any uninsurable or uninsured risks.\nOur international operations expose us to risks which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the United States. This could expose us to increased adverse economic and industry conditions which may have a negative impact on our ability to manage our existing operations or pursue alternative strategic transactions, which could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe global nature of our acquisitions expands the risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this section, including the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in local political, economic, social and labor conditions in the markets in which we operate, including Europe, Brazil and Canada;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange controls on currency conversion and the transfer of funds that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the United States in a tax-efficient manner;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations, currency restructurings, and hyperinflation or deflation, and our ability to manage these fluctuations through a foreign exchange risk management program;\n\u2022\ndifferent employee/employer relationships, laws and regulations and existence of employment tribunals;\n\u2022\nlaws and regulations imposed by foreign governments, including those relating to governing data security, sharing and transfer;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences resulting from changes in tax laws in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u2022\nlogistical, communications and other challenges caused by distance and cultural and language differences, each making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nrisks related to crimes, strikes, riots, civil disturbances, terrorist attacks, wars and natural disasters in a variety of new geographical locations;\n\u2022\nvolatility of global credit markets and the availability of consumer credit and financing in our international markets\n\u2022\nuncertainty as to the enforceability of contract and intellectual property rights under local laws;\n\u2022\nthe potential of forced nationalization of certain industries, or the impact on creditors' rights, consumer disposable income levels, flexibility and availability of consumer credit, and the ability to enforce and collect aged or charged-off debts stemming from foreign governmental actions, whether through austerity or stimulus measures or initiative, intended to control or influence macroeconomic factors such as wages, unemployment, national output or consumption, inflation, investment, credit, finance, taxation or other economic drivers;\n\u2022\nrapid changes in government policy, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism, or threat of international boycotts or United States anti-boycott legislation;\n\u2022\nincreases in anti-American sentiment and the identification of international acquisitions with American sentiments;\n\u2022\nthe presence of varying levels of business corruption in international markets and the effect of various anti-corruption and other laws on our foreign operations;\n\u2022\ngiven our high employee turnover rates, changing labor conditions and long-term trends towards higher wages in developed and emerging international markets as well as the potential impact of union organizing efforts on day-to-day operations and our ability to staff our international operations;\n\u2022\npotential damage to our reputation due to non-compliance with foreign and local laws; and\n\u2022\nthe complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants.\nAny one of these factors could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nExchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe operate internationally, enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies, and report our financial results in U.S. dollars. As a result, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies or amongst the foreign currencies may adversely affect our net income. We may or may not implement a hedging program related to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, if implemented, such hedging programs could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGoodwill or other intangible asset impairment could negatively impact our net income and stockholders' equity.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of goodwill as a result of our acquisitions. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. There are numerous risks that may cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount, which could lead to the recognition of goodwill impairment. These risks include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions, the business climate, or the market for the entity's products or services; significant variances between actual and expected financial results; negative or declining cash flows; lowered expectations of future results; failure to realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions; significant expense increases; a more likely-than-not expectation of selling or disposing all or a portion of a reporting unit; the loss of key personnel; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and a sustained decrease in the Company's share price.\nOur goodwill impairment testing involves the use of estimates and the exercise of judgment, including judgments regarding expected future business performance and market conditions. Significant changes in our assessment of such factors, including the deterioration of market conditions, could affect our assessment of the fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.\nOther intangible assets, such as client and customer relationships, non-compete agreements and trademarks, are amortized. Risks such as those that could lead to the recognition of goodwill impairment, could also lead to the recognition of other intangible asset impairment.\nOur senior management team is important to our continued success and the loss of one or more members of senior management could negatively affect our operations.\nThe loss of the services of one or more of our key executive officers or key employees could disrupt our operations. We have employment agreements with our CEO and several of our other senior executives. The current agreements contain non-compete provisions that survive termination of employment. However, these agreements do not and will not assure the continued services of these officers and we cannot ensure that the non-compete provisions will be enforceable. Our success depends on the continued service and performance of our key executive officers, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain those individuals.\nOur U.S. work force could become unionized in the future, which could adversely affect the stability of our operations and increase our costs.\nCurrently, none of our employees in the United States are represented by unions. However, our U.S. employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union. If some of our U.S. workforce were to become unionized and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could adversely affect the stability of our work force and increase our costs.\nAdditional tax obligations, results of tax audits, or unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could harm our financial results.\nWe are subject to taxes in the markets in which we operate. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Recent proposals by the current U.S. administration for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, including without limitation provisions that would limit the ability of U.S. multinationals to defer U.S. taxes on foreign\nincome, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Any of these changes could have an adverse effect on our profitability. The determination of the worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may adversely affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nOur tax filings are subject to audit by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes, adjustments to the timing of taxable income or deductions or allocations of income among tax jurisdictions. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFor tax purposes, we utilize the cost recovery method of accounting for our finance receivables. Under the cost recovery method, collections on finance receivables are applied first to principal to reduce the finance receivables to zero before taxable income is recognized. The Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") examined our 2005 through 2012 tax returns and asserted that tax revenue recognition using the cost recovery method does not clearly reflect taxable income. We believe we have sufficient support for the technical merits of our position, and believe cost recovery to be an acceptable tax revenue recognition method for our industry. We received Notices of Deficiency for tax years ended December 31, 2005 through 2012. The proposed deficiencies relate to the cost recovery method of tax accounting for finance receivables. In response to the notices, we filed petitions in the United States Tax Court (the \"Tax Court\") challenging the deficiency. On July 10, 2015 and July 21, 2015, the IRS filed motions for summary judgment for tax years 2008 through 2012 and 2005 through 2007, respectively. On October 30, 2015, the Tax Court held oral arguments on the IRS motions. On November 12, 2015, the IRS Motions for Summary Judgment were denied. The Tax Court also set this matter for trial, to begin on September 19, 2016. If we are unsuccessful in the Tax Court and any potential appeals, we may ultimately be required to pay the related deferred taxes, and possibly interest and penalties. Any adverse determination on this matter could result in our amending state tax returns for prior years, increasing our taxable income in those states. We file tax returns in multiple state jurisdictions; therefore, any underpayment of state tax will accrue interest in accordance with the respective state statute. Deferred tax liabilities related to this item were $251.7 million at December 31, 2015. Any adverse determination on this matter could result in our amending state tax returns for prior years, increasing our taxable income in those states. Our estimate of the potential federal and state interest is $91.0 million as of December 31, 2015. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements \"Commitments and Contingencies\" as included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for more information.\nFor financial reporting purposes, we utilize the interest method of revenue recognition for determining our income recognized on finance receivables, which is based on an analysis of projected cash flows that may prove to be less than anticipated and could lead to reductions in future revenues or the incurrence of allowance charges.\nWe utilize the interest method to determine income recognized on finance receivables under the guidance of Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification 310-30, \"Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality\" (\"ASC 310-30\"). Under this method, pools of receivables we acquire are modeled upon their projected cash flows. A yield is then established which, when applied to the unamortized purchase price of the receivables, results in the recognition of income at a constant yield relative to the remaining balance in the pool. Each pool is analyzed regularly to assess the actual performance compared to that derived from our models. Under ASC 310-30, rather than lowering the estimated yield if the collection estimates are not received or projected to be received, the carrying value of a pool would be written down to maintain the then current yield and is shown as a reduction in revenue in the consolidated income statements with a corresponding valuation allowance offsetting finance receivables, net, on the consolidated balance sheets. As a result, if the accuracy of the modeling process deteriorates or there is a significant decline in anticipated future cash flows, we could incur reductions in future revenues resulting from additional allowance charges, which could reduce our profitability in a given period.\nOur loss contingency accruals may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nWe are involved in judicial, regulatory, and arbitration proceedings or investigations concerning matters arising from our business activities. We have adopted reasonable compliance procedures and believe we have meritorious defenses in all material litigation pending against us; however, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome. We establish accruals for potential liability arising from legal proceedings when it is probable that such liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not accrued a liability. In addition, actual losses may be higher than the amount accrued for a certain matter, or in the aggregate. An unfavorable resolution of a legal proceeding or claim could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. For more information, refer to the \"Litigation and Regulatory Matters\" section of Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements \"Commitments and Contingencies\" as included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nClass action suits and other litigation could divert our management's attention from operating our business and increase our expenses.\nGrantors, debt purchasers and third-party collection agencies and attorneys in the consumer credit industry are frequently subject to putative class action lawsuits and other litigation. Claims include failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations and improper or deceptive origination and servicing practices. Even when the basis for the litigation is groundless, considerable resources may be needed to respond, and such class action lawsuits or other litigation could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAdverse litigation outcomes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nIt is likely that legal actions, proceedings and other claims arising out of the collection of nonperforming loans will continue to be filed against us and our debt collection affiliates for the foreseeable future. Victories by plaintiffs in highly publicized cases against us or other debt collection companies may stimulate further claims. A material increase in the number of pending claims could significantly increase our defense costs. In addition, adverse outcomes in pending cases could have adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and our ability to prevail in other related litigation. For more information, refer to the \"Legal Proceedings\" section below.\nWe rely on our systems, including our telecommunications and computers systems, our employees, significant vendors, and certain failures or disruptions could adversely affect the continuity of our business operations.\nWe may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are not entirely within our control. Those events may include, for example, terrorist attacks, war and the outcome of war and threats of attacks; computer viruses; electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters; computer hacking attacks; malicious employee acts; other intentional destructive human acts; loss or disruption of significant vendors; and disease pandemics. We could be subject to both private and public legal actions if consumer information stored in our systems is lost or misappropriated, as we are subject to extensive laws and regulations concerning the use and safeguarding of this information. Any or all of these occurrences could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, our success depends in large part on sophisticated telecommunications and computer systems. The temporary or permanent loss of our computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems, through casualty or operating malfunction, could disrupt our operations. In the normal course of our business, we must record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately to access, maintain and expand the databases we use for our collection activities. A failure of our information systems or software and our backup systems would interrupt our business operations and harm our business. Our headquarters are located in a region that is susceptible to hurricane damage, which may increase the risk of disruption of information systems and telephone service for sustained periods.\nFurther, our business depends heavily on services provided by various local and long distance telephone companies. A significant increase in telephone service costs or any significant interruption in telephone services could reduce our profitability or disrupt our operations and harm our business.\nThe occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cyber-security, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption in our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information or damage to our Company's image, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.\nA cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information resources. More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional or unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information. Our business is highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions across markets and in multiple currencies. As our geographical reach expands, maintaining the security of our systems and infrastructure becomes more significant. Privacy laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere govern the collection and transmission of personal data. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those we have outsourced. Our three primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident are operational interruption, damage to our image, and private data exposure. Private data may include customer information, our employees' personally identifiable information, or proprietary business information such as underwriting and collections methodologies. We have implemented solutions, processes, and procedures to help mitigate these risks, but these measures, as well as our organization's increased awareness of our risk of a cyber incident do not guarantee that our financial results will not be negatively impacted by such an incident. Should such a cyber incident occur, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to notify affected consumers, modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to fines, penalties, litigation costs and settlements and financial losses that may not be fully covered by our cyber insurance.\nWe serve markets that are highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete with businesses that may have greater resources than us.\nWe face competition in the markets we serve from new and existing providers of outsourced receivables management services, including other purchasers of defaulted receivables portfolios, contingent fee businesses and debt owners that manage their own defaulted receivables rather than outsourcing them.\nWe face bidding competition in our acquisition of defaulted receivables and in our placement of fee based receivables, and we also compete on the basis of reputation, industry experience and performance. Some of our current competitors and possible new competitors may have greater financial, personnel and other resources, and greater adaptability to changing market needs. There has been substantial activity in mergers and consolidation of companies in our industry, and efforts by our competitors to gain market share have resulted in significant portfolio pricing pressure. Moreover, our competitors may elect to pay prices that we determine are not reasonable and, in that event, our volume of purchases may be diminished.\nWe may make business acquisitions that prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources.\nThrough acquisitions, we may enter markets in which we have no or limited experience. Further, acquisitions may place additional constraints on our resources by diverting the attention of our management team from other business concerns. Moreover, any acquisition may result in a potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities or may result in the incurrence of additional debt and amortization expenses of related intangible assets, which could reduce our profitability and harm our business.\nWe intend to consider additional acquisitions of companies that could complement our business, including the acquisition of entities offering greater access and expertise in other asset types and markets that are related but that we do not currently serve. We may not be able to successfully operate future acquired entities, or integrate these businesses with our own, and we may be unable to maintain our standards, controls and policies.\nWe may not be able to maintain and manage our growth effectively.\nOur strategy is to grow organically and supplement that growth with select acquisitions. We have grown significantly since our formation and we intend to maintain this focus. Our growth places additional demands on our resources and we cannot ensure that we will be able to manage our growth effectively. In order to successfully manage our growth, we may need to:\n\u2022\nexpand and enhance our administrative infrastructure;\n\u2022\ncontinue to improve our management, financial and information systems and controls; and\n\u2022\nrecruit, train, manage and retain our employees effectively.\nContinued growth could place a strain on our management, operations and financial resources. We cannot ensure that our infrastructure, facilities and personnel will be adequate to support our future operations or to effectively adapt to future growth. If we cannot manage our growth effectively, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nNegative publicity or reputational attacks could damage our reputation and our business.\nFrom time to time there are negative news stories about our industry or company, especially with respect to alleged conduct in collecting debt from customers. Internet sites are maintained where consumers can list their concerns about the activities of debt collectors and seek guidance from other website posters on how to handle the situation. Advertisements by debt relief attorneys and credit counseling centers are becoming more common, adding to the negative attention given to our industry. Negative public opinion about our alleged or actual debt collection practices or about the debt collection industry, including those expressed via television, newspapers, radio, or social media such as blogs, websites or newsletters, regardless of the factual accuracy of the assertions, could adversely impact our stock price and our ability to retain and attract customers and employees and customers may be more reluctant to pay their debts and more likely to pursue legal action against us regardless of whether those actions are warranted. Furthermore, such negative publicity could result in financial institutions reducing or eliminating sales of portfolios to us which would harm our business and negatively impact our financial results.\nThe sudden collapse of one of the financial institutions in which we are depositors could negatively affect our financial results.\nWe maintain depository accounts with financial institutions in the Americas and Europe for daily cash flow needs. If one of the financial institutions in which we have significant deposits were to collapse suddenly, we could potentially be unable to retrieve our deposits and therefore incur significant losses relating to the lost deposits in excess of the insured amounts. This could have an adverse effect on our financial results. The International Association of Deposit Insurers, a non-profit organization based in Switzerland, provides guidance for deposit insurance which is provided either publicly or privately by each country in which we hold deposit accounts.\nRisks associated with governmental regulation and laws\nOur ability to collect and enforce our finance receivables may be limited under federal, state and foreign laws, regulations and policies.\nThe businesses conducted by our operating subsidiaries are subject to licensing and regulation by governmental and regulatory bodies in the many jurisdictions in which we operate and conduct our business. Federal and state laws and the laws and regulations of the foreign countries in which we operate may limit our ability to collect and enforce our defaulted consumer receivables regardless of any act or omission on our part. Some laws and regulations applicable to credit issuers may preclude us from collecting on defaulted consumer receivables we purchase if the credit issuer previously failed to comply with applicable laws in generating or servicing those receivables. Collection laws and regulations also directly apply to our business. Such laws and regulations are extensive and subject to change. A variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, transmission, sharing and security of consumer data. Additional consumer protection and privacy protection laws may be enacted that would impose additional requirements on the enforcement of and collection on consumer credit receivables, including regulations that are expected to be adopted by the CFPB, and any other laws that U.S. and non-U.S. governments are implementing or considering concerning the regulation and supervision of financial institutions and consumer lending. Any new laws, rules or regulations that may be adopted, as well as existing consumer protection and privacy protection laws, changes in the ways that existing rules or laws are interpreted or enforced and any procedures that may be implemented as a result of regulatory consent orders may adversely affect our ability to collect on our receivables and may harm our business. In addition to the oversight of our industry by the CFPB noted below, other federal, state and local governmental bodies are also considering, and may consider in the future, legislative proposals that would regulate the collection of our receivables. Further, certain tax laws could negatively impact our ability to collect or cause us to incur additional expenses. Although we cannot predict if or how any future legislation would impact our business, our failure to comply with any current or future laws or regulations applicable to us could limit our ability to collect on our receivables, which could reduce our profitability and harm our business.\nOur ability to collect on portfolios of bankrupt or insolvent consumer receivables may be impacted by changes in, or interpretations of, laws or changes in the administrative practices of the various courts.\nWe file claims on consumer receivables in which consumers have filed for insolvency or bankruptcy protection under relevant laws. We receive payments from courts, receivers and liquidators on receivables which became bankrupt after we acquired them, and we also purchase accounts that are currently in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. Our ability to collect on portfolios of bankrupt or insolvent receivables may be impacted by changes in, or interpretations of, laws or changes in administrative practices of the various courts.\nFailure to comply with existing and new government regulation of the collections industry could result in penalties, fines, litigation, damage to our reputation or the suspension or termination of our ability to conduct our business.\nThe collections industry throughout the markets in which we operate is governed by various laws and regulations, many of which require us to be a licensed debt collector. Our industry is also at times investigated by regulators and offices of state attorneys general, and subpoenas and other requests or demands for information may be issued by governmental authorities who are investigating debt collection activities. These investigations may result in enforcement actions, fines and penalties, or the assertion of private claims and lawsuits. For instance, in the United States the FTC has the authority to investigate consumer complaints against debt collection companies and to recommend enforcement actions and seek monetary penalties. In the United Kingdom our operations are subject to regulation and supervision by the Prudential Regulation Authority. As discussed below, our U.S. debt collection activities are also subject to supervision and enforcement action by the CFPB. Refer to \"Compliance with complex and evolving foreign and United States laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, which have expanded as a result of our foreign acquisitions, could increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions.\" If any such investigations result in findings that we or our vendors have failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to penalties, litigation losses and expenses, damage to our reputation, or the suspension or termination of, or required modification to, our ability to conduct collections, which would adversely affect our financial results and condition. In addition, new laws or regulations or changes in the ways that existing rules or laws are interpreted or enforced could limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of compliance. Furthermore, judges or regulatory bodies could interpret current rules or laws differently than the way we do, leading to such adverse consequences described above.\nIn a number of jurisdictions, we must maintain licenses to perform debt recovery services and must satisfy related bonding requirements. It is our policy to comply with all applicable licensing and bonding requirements. Our failure to comply with existing licensing requirements, changing interpretations of existing requirements, or adoption of new licensing requirements, could restrict our ability to collect in regions, subject us to increased regulation, increase our costs, or adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables.\nSome laws, among other things, also may limit the interest rate and the fees that a credit grantor may impose on our consumers, limit the time in which we may file legal actions to enforce consumer accounts, and require specific account information for certain collection activities. In addition, local requirements and court rulings in various jurisdictions also may affect our ability to collect.\nMoreover, the relationship between consumers and credit card issuers is extensively regulated by consumer protection and related laws and regulations. These laws may affect some of our operations because the majority of our receivables originate through credit card transactions. If the originating institution fails to comply with applicable statutes, rules, and regulations, it could create claims and rights for the consumers that could reduce or eliminate their obligations related to those receivables. When we acquire receivables, we generally require the credit grantor or portfolio reseller to represent that they have complied with applicable statutes, rules and regulations relating to the origination and collection of the receivables before they were sold to us.\nRegulations and statutes applicable to our industry further provide that, in some cases, consumers cannot be held liable for, or their liability may be limited with respect to, charges to their debt or credit card accounts that resulted from unauthorized use of their credit. These laws, among others, may limit our ability to recover amounts owing with respect to the receivables, whether or not we committed any wrongful act or omission in connection with the account. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, such failure could result in penalties, litigation losses and expenses, damage to our reputation, or otherwise impact our ability to conduct collections efforts, which could adversely affect our financial results and condition.\nInvestigations or enforcement actions by governmental authorities may result in changes to our business practices; negatively impact our receivables portfolio purchasing volume; make collection of receivables more difficult or expose us to the risk of fines, penalties, restitution payments and litigation.\nOur business practices are subject to review from time to time by various governmental authorities and regulators, including the CFPB, who may commence investigations or enforcement actions or reviews targeted at businesses in the financial services industry. These reviews may involve governmental authority consideration of individual consumer complaints, or could involve a broader review of our debt collection policies and practices. Such investigations could lead to assertions by governmental authorities that we are not complying with applicable laws or regulations. In such circumstances, authorities may request or seek to impose a range of remedies that could involve potential compensatory or punitive damage claims, fines, restitution payments, sanctions or injunctive relief, that if agreed to or granted, could require us to make payments or incur other expenditures that could have an adverse effect on our financial position. Government authorities could also request or seek to require us to cease certain of our practices or institute new practices. We may also elect to change practices that we believe are compliant with applicable law and regulations in order to respond to the concerns of governmental authorities. In addition, we may become required to make changes to our internal policies and procedures in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act or other applicable laws. Such changes in practices or procedures could negatively impact our results of operations. Negative publicity relating to investigations or proceedings brought by governmental authorities could have an adverse impact on our reputation, could harm our ability to conduct business with industry participants, and could result in financial institutions reducing or eliminating sales of receivables portfolios to us which would harm our business and negatively impact our financial results. Moreover, changing or modifying our internal policies or procedures, responding to governmental inquiries and investigations and defending lawsuits or other proceedings could require significant efforts on the part of management and result in increased costs to our business. In addition, such efforts could divert management's full attention from our business operations. All of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe CFPB has issued civil investigative demands to many companies that it regulates, and is currently examining practices regarding the collection of consumer debt. We responded to such an investigation regarding our debt collection practices and provided documents and data to the CFPB. In addition to providing the CFPB with the data and documents requested, we engaged in discussions, including a number of face-to-face meetings with the CFPB staff wherein we shared our views on potential changes to the debt collection industry. Subsequently, in September 2015, we entered into a consent order with the CFPB (the \"Consent Order\"), which resulted in the payment of $19 million in consumer refunds and an $8 million penalty. In addition, we were required to cease collection of approximately $3 million of consumer debt and modify some of our collections practices. Although we do not anticipate any material adverse impact on our operations as a result of our entry into the Consent Order, there can be no assurance that additional litigation or new industry regulations currently under consideration by the CFPB would not have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, the CFPB may monitor our compliance with the Consent Order and could make a determination that we have failed to appropriately adhere to our obligations. Such a determination could result in additional inquiries, penalties or liabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact our operations.\nTitle X of the Dodd-Frank Act (also referred to as the Consumer Financial Protection Act) created a new independent regulator, the CFPB. The CFPB has rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement and other authorities relating to consumer financial products and services, including debt collection, provided by covered persons. We are subject to the CFPB's supervisory and enforcement authority.\nAs stated above, the relationship between consumers, lenders and credit card issuers is extensively regulated by consumer protection and related laws and regulations. Changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment. This could affect our results of operations or increase our liabilities. These negative impacts could result from changes in collection laws, laws related to credit reporting, statutes of limitation, laws related to consumer bankruptcy or insolvency, privacy protection, accounting standards, taxation requirements, employment laws and communications laws, among others. For example, the CFPB is currently in the process of formulating new debt collection regulations.\nThe CFPB also accepts debt collection consumer complaints and has provided form letters for consumers to use in their correspondences with debt collectors. The CFPB makes publicly available its data on consumer complaints, and consumer complaints against us could result in reputational damage to us. The Dodd-Frank Act also mandates the submission of multiple studies and reports to Congress by the CFPB, and CFPB staff is regularly making speeches on topics related to credit and debt. All of these activities could trigger additional legislative or regulatory action.\nThe CFPB has rulemaking authority with respect to significant federal statutes that impact the debt collection industry, including the FDCPA, the FCRA, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices. As a result, the CFPB has the authority to adopt regulations that interpret the FDCPA, and the FTC Act, potentially describing specified acts and practices as being \"unfair,\" \"deceptive\" or \"abusive,\" impacting the manner in which we conduct our debt collection business.\nThe CFPB has the authority to conduct hearings and adjudication proceedings, impose monetary penalties for violations of applicable federal consumer financial laws (including Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, FDCPA, and FCRA, among other consumer protection statutes) which may require remediation of practices and include enforcement actions. The CFPB also has the authority to obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief), costs, and monetary penalties (ranging from $5,000 per day to over $1 million per day, depending on the nature and gravity of the violation). In addition, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations implemented thereunder, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state Attorneys General and other state regulators to bring civil actions to remedy violations under state law. The CFPB has been active in its supervision, examination and enforcement of financial services companies, most notably bringing enforcement actions imposing fines and mandating large refunds to customers of several financial institutions for practices relating to the extension and collection of consumer credit. If the CFPB, the FTC, acting under the FTC Act or other applicable statute such as the FDCPA, or one or more state Attorneys General or other state regulators make findings that we have violated any of the applicable laws or regulations, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.\nWe may become subject to additional costs or liabilities in the future resulting from our own, or our vendors' supervision or examination by the CFPB, or by changes in, or additions to laws and regulations that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Further, we cannot definitively predict the scope and substance of any such laws or regulations ultimately adopted by the CFPB related to our activities and the exact efforts required by us to comply therewith, nor can we have any way to know with certainty the ultimate impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition that such regulations may have.\nCompliance with complex and evolving foreign and United States laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, which have expanded as a result of our foreign acquisitions, could increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions.\nAs a result of our foreign acquisitions, we will operate on an expanded international basis with additional offices or activities in a number of new jurisdictions throughout Europe, Canada and Brazil. We will face increased exposure to risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with complex foreign and United States laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, which could increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include anti-corruption laws such as the FCPA, the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010 and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and those related to taxation. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit U.S.-based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010 prohibits certain entities from making improper payments to governmental officials and to commercial entities. Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that we may inadvertently breach certain provisions of these laws, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements, or otherwise. Violations\nof these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also adversely affect our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented and, with respect to any new jurisdictions we will enter, will implement, policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies. Additionally, in accordance with the CRD IV, the Swedish Banking and Financing Business Act and the Supervision of Credit and Investment Institutions Act, certain of our EU subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy requirements as prescribed by the SFSA, because they are included in a group that includes an entity which has been determined to be an EU authorized credit institution (AK Nordic AB), thereby resulting in their supervision by the SFSA and regulatory capital requirements.\nNet capital requirements pursuant to the CRD IV may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries.\nA sub-group of the Company's EU subsidiaries has been determined by the SFSA to be financial institutions subject to consolidated capital requirements under EU Directives and regulatory oversight, supervision and reporting requirements by the SFSA. These and other similar provisions of applicable law may limit our ability to withdraw capital from our subsidiaries. Additionally, we have limited experience with the regulatory oversight, supervision, and reporting requirements of the SFSA.\nRisks associated with indebtedness\nWe may not be able to retain, renegotiate or replace our credit facilities.\nOur sources of financing include a domestic credit facility along with a European multicurrency revolving credit facility. The domestic facility includes an aggregate principal amount of $945 million which consists of a $170 million variable rate term loan, a $725 million domestic revolving credit facility and a $50 million Canadian revolving credit facility, all which mature on December 19, 2017. The European multicurrency revolving credit facility includes an aggregate principal amount of $790 million which consists of a $750 million revolving facility and a $40 million overdraft facility, and matures on October 23, 2019. Both facilities include financial and other restrictive covenants. If we are unable to retain, renegotiate or replace our credit facilities, our growth could be adversely affected, which could negatively impact liquidity and our business operations.\nWe may not be able to continue to satisfy the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our debt.\nThe agreements governing our debt impose a number of covenants, including restrictive covenants on how we operate our business. Failure to satisfy any one of these covenants could result in negative consequences including the following, each of which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to conduct business:\n\u2022\nacceleration of outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022\nexercise by our lenders of rights with respect to the collateral pledged under certain of our outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022\nour inability to continue to purchase receivables needed to operate our business; or\n\u2022\nour inability to secure alternative financing on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe have additional indebtedness in the form of Convertible Senior Notes.\nIn August 2013, we completed a private offering of $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the \u201cNotes\u201d). Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, or to make cash payments in connection with any conversion of the Notes depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our indebtedness and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring indebtedness or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at that time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change or to settle conversions in cash.\nHolders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, in the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. Upon a conversion of Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock\nto settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares of our common stock), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered to settle conversions in cash, and our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay cash upon conversion may be limited by law.\nConversion of the Notes may affect the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares of common stock upon conversion. Holders of the Notes will be able to convert them only upon the satisfaction of certain conditions prior to February 1, 2020. Upon conversion, holders of the Notes will receive cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. Any sales in the public market of shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Notes could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nChanges in interest rates could increase our interest expense and reduce our net income.\nOur revolving credit facilities bear interest at variable rates. Increases in interest rates could increase our interest expense which would, in turn, lower our earnings. From time to time, we may enter into hedging transactions to mitigate our interest rate risk on all or a portion of our debt. Hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections. If these assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, we may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks associated with ownership of our common stock\nThe market price of our shares of common stock could fluctuate significantly.\nWide fluctuations in the trading price or volume of our shares of common stock could be caused by many factors, including factors relating to our company or to investor perception of our company (including changes in financial estimates and recommendations by research analysts), but also factors relating to (or relating to investor perception of) the receivables management industry, debt collection or the economy in general.\nOur certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that may prevent or delay a change of control or that may otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that may make it more difficult, expensive or otherwise discourage a tender offer or a change in control or takeover attempt by a third-party, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders. The existence of these provisions may have a negative impact on the price of our common stock by discouraging third-party investors from purchasing our common stock. In particular, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nclassify our board of directors into three groups, each of which will serve for staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\npermit a majority of the stockholders to remove our directors only for cause;\n\u2022\npermit our directors, and not our stockholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nrequire stockholders to give us advance notice to nominate candidates for election to our board of directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders' meeting;\n\u2022\npermit a special meeting of our stockholders to be called only by approval of a majority of the directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president or the written request of holders owning at least 30% of our common stock;\n\u2022\npermit our board of directors to issue, without approval of our stockholders, preferred stock with such terms as our board of directors may determine;\n\u2022\npermit the authorized number of directors to be changed only by a resolution of the board of directors;\n\u2022\nrequire that derivative actions or proceedings must be brought in a court located in the state of Delaware; and\n\u2022\nrequire the vote of the holders of a majority of our voting shares for stockholder amendments to our by-laws.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which provides certain restrictions on business combinations between us and any party acquiring a 15% or greater interest in our voting stock other than in a transaction approved by our board of directors and, in certain cases, by our stockholders. These provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control, even if our stockholders support such proposals. Moreover, these provisions could diminish the opportunities for stockholders to participate in certain tender offers, including tender offers at prices above the then-current market value of our common stock, and may also inhibit increases in the trading price of our common stock that could result from takeover attempts or speculation.", "PERMNO": 89574, "SIC": 6153, "TIC": "PRAA"}
