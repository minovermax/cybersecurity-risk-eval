RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or stock price could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties described below.\nRisks Related to Market Conditions\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant impact on our business, and depending on the duration of the pandemic and its effect on the oil and gas industry, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. Our clients in the oil and gas industry have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues. The COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have created significant volatility, uncertainty and turmoil in the oil and gas industry in the past two years. Since the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, these events have directly affected our business and have exacerbated the potential negative impact from many of our risks, including those relating to the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas, our clients\u2019 capital spending and trends in oil and natural gas prices. In addition, the pandemic and efforts to mitigate its spread have resulted in logistical challenges to our operations, including travel restrictions that prevent our personnel from commuting to certain facilities and job sites. These logistical challenges could increase if the pandemic worsens or persists.\nOil demand during 2020 and 2021 was substantially less than demand in 2019 as a result of the virus and corresponding measures taken around the world to mitigate its spread. Though demand began to increase during the latter part of 2021, a worsening of the virus could result in an increase in mitigation efforts and a reduction in demand for oil and gas and our services and products. Given the nature and significance of the events described above, we are not able to enumerate all related potential risks to our business; however, we believe that in addition to the impacts described above, other current and potential impacts of these recent events include, but are not limited to: greater supply chain disruption, which could have an adverse impact on volumes and make it more difficult for us to serve our clients; liquidity challenges, including impacts related to delayed customer payments and payment defaults associated with customer liquidity issues and bankruptcies; notices from customers, suppliers, and other third parties arguing that their non-performance under our contracts with them is permitted as a result of force majeure or other reasons; cybersecurity issues, as digital technologies may become more vulnerable and experience a higher rate of cyberattacks in the current environment of remote connectivity; litigation risk and possible loss contingencies related to COVID-19 and its impact, including with respect to commercial contracts, employee matters, and insurance arrangements; infections and quarantining of our employees and the personnel of our customers, suppliers, and other third parties in areas in which we operate; actions undertaken by national, regional, and local governments and health officials to contain COVID-19 or treat its effects; and structural shift in the global economy and its demand for oil and natural gas as a result of changes in the way people work, travel, and interact, or in connection with a global recession or depression.\nGiven the dynamic nature of these events, we cannot reasonably estimate the period of time that the COVID-19 pandemic and related market conditions will persist or any changes in their severity, the full extent of the impact they will have on our business, liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition or the pace or extent of any recovery. To the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our business, liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks.\nTable of Content\nThe economic environment may affect client demand for our services. Future economic and political uncertainty may reduce the availability of liquidity and credit and, in many cases, reduce demand for our clients\u2019 products. Disruption of the credit markets could also adversely affect our clients\u2019 ability to finance ongoing maintenance and new capital projects, resulting in contract cancellations or suspensions, capital project delays, repurposing of infrastructure, and infrastructure closures. An extended or deep recession may result in plant closures or other contractions in our client base. These factors may also adversely affect our ability to collect payment for work we have previously performed. Furthermore, our ability to expand our business could be limited if, in the future, we are unable to increase our credit capacity under favorable terms or at all. Such disruptions, should they occur, could materially impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nExtended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. While we continue to expand our market presence in the areas of aerospace and defense, construction, chemical processing, manufacturing, power generation, and public infrastructure, among other industries, economic downturns within the oil and gas industry including crude oil prices have, and could continue to, result in reduction in demand for our services.\nOur revenues are heavily dependent on certain industries. Sales of our services are dependent on clients in certain industries, particularly the refining and petrochemical industries. As we have experienced in the past, and as we expect to occur in the future, downturns characterized by diminished demand for services in these industries as well as potential changes due to consolidation or changes in client businesses or governmental regulations, could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Certain clients have employees represented by unions and could be subject to temporary work stoppage which could impact our activity level.\nWe sell our services in highly competitive markets, which places pressure on our profit margins and limits our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our services. Our competition generally stems from other outside service contractors, many of whom offer a similar range of services. Future economic uncertainty could generally reduce demand for industrial services and thus create a more competitive bidding environment for new and existing work. No assurances can be made that we will continue to maintain our pricing model and our profit margins or increase our market share.\nOur ongoing investments in new client markets involve significant risks, could disrupt our current operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect. Our ability to compete successfully in new client markets depends on our ability to continue to deliver innovative, relevant and useful services to our clients in a timely manner. As a result, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest resources in developing products and services to new clients. Such investments may not prioritize short-term financial results and may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including encountering new competitors. We may fail to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin or other value to justify our investments in such new client markets, thereby harming our ability to generate revenue.\nIf we cannot regain compliance with the NYSE\u2019s continuing listing requirements and rules, the NYSE may delist our common stock, which could negatively affect our company, the price of our common stock and your ability to sell our common stock.\nOn February 2, 2022, we were notified by the NYSE that the average closing price of our common stock, over a prior 30 consecutive trading day period was below $1.00 per share, which is the minimum average closing price per share required to maintain listing on the NYSE under Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. We have a period of six months following the receipt of the notice to regain compliance with the minimum share price requirement, with the possibility of extension at the discretion of the NYSE. In order to regain compliance, on the last trading day in any calendar month during the cure period, our common stock must have: (i) a closing price of at least $1.00 per share; and (ii) an average closing price of at least $1.00 per share over the 30 trading day period ending on the last trading day of such month. If we fail to regain compliance with Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual by the end of the cure period, our common stock will be subject to the NYSE\u2019s suspension and delisting procedures. We are closely monitoring the closing share price of our common stock and are considering all available options. We intend to regain compliance with the NYSE listing standards by pursuing measures that are in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders, including potentially through the consummation of a reverse stock split, subject to Board of Director and shareholder approval.\nA delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; limiting our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future; decreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage of us; and causing us reputational harm with investors, our employees, and parties conducting business with us. A delisting of our common stock could constitute a \u201cfundamental change\u201d under the terms of our 5.00% Convertible Notes due 2023 (the \u201cNotes\u201d), requiring us to make an offer to repurchase the Notes at par. There can be no assurance we would have sufficient funds available to us to repurchase the Notes if required to do so. Failure to repurchase the Notes also could cause a cross-default under our ABL Credit Facility and Term Loans, which would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate the maturity thereof and proceed against their collateral and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nTable of Content\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nIf we are not able to implement commercially competitive services in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, client requirements, competitive pressures and technology trends, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Competition can place downward pressure on our prices and profit margins. Our share of the market for our services is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more cost-effective services. If we are not able to implement commercially competitive services and products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, client requirements, competitive pressures, inflationary pressures and technology trends, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment, facilities, or work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive, and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business depends upon the maintenance of our proprietary technologies and information. We depend on our proprietary technologies and information, many of which are no longer subject to patent protection. In addition to patent protection, we rely significantly upon trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technologies. We regularly enter into confidentiality agreements with our key employees, clients, potential clients and other third parties and limit access to and distribution of our trade secrets and other proprietary information. However, these measures may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technologies or to assure that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies. In addition, because we operate worldwide, the laws of other countries in which we operate may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We are also subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of intellectual property rights\nNo assurances can be made that we will be successful in maintaining or renewing our contracts with our clients. A significant portion of our contracts and agreements with clients may be terminated by either party on short notice. Although we actively pursue the renewal of our contracts, we cannot assure that we will be able to renew these contracts or that the terms of the renewed contracts will be as favorable as the existing contracts. If we are unable to renew or replace these contracts, or if we renew on less favorable terms, we may suffer a material reduction in revenue and earnings.\nNo assurances can be made that we will be successful in hiring or retaining members of a skilled technical workforce. We have a skilled technical workforce and an industry recognized technician training program for each of our service lines that prepares new employees as well as further trains our existing employees. The competition for these individuals is intense. Due to the impacts of COVID-19, we implemented cost reductions and organizational changes which increases our risk of losing key skilled employees. Furthermore, once the economic environment and demand for our services has recovered, we will be under pressure to re-hire or onboard employees during a time when there could be a significant demand for skilled labor. The loss of these individuals, or failure to attract new employees, could adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations on our clients\u2019 projects or maintenance and consequently could negatively impact the demand for our products and services.\nThe loss or unavailability of any of our executive officers or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. We depend greatly on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees to manage and exercise leadership over our operations. The loss or unavailability of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nUnsatisfactory quality of service execution, including safety performance, can affect client relationships, eliminate or reduce revenue streams from our largest clients, result in higher operating costs and negatively impact our ability to hire and retain a skilled technical workforce. The services we provide could incur quality of execution issues that may be caused by our workforce personnel and/or components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our services does not meet our clients\u2019 expectations or satisfaction, then our sales and operating earnings, and, ultimately, our reputation, could be negatively impacted. Additionally, our workers are subject to the normal hazards associated with providing services at industrial facilities. Even with proper safety precautions, these hazards can lead to personal injury, loss of life, destruction of property, plant and equipment, lower employee morale and environmental damage. While we are intensely focused on maintaining a strong safety environment and minimizing the risk of accidents, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be effective. Poor safety performance may limit or eliminate potential revenue streams, including from many of our largest clients, and may materially increase our operating costs, including increasing our required insurance deductibles, self-insured retention and insurance premium costs.\nAdditional impairments of our goodwill, impairments of our intangible and other long-lived assets, and changes in the estimated useful lives of intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. As a result of past acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets. As of December 31, 2021, our goodwill and intangible assets totaled $25.2 million and $89.9 million, respectively. We assess or test goodwill for impairment at least annually in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (\u201cGAAP\u201d), while our other long-lived assets, including our finite-lived intangible assets, are tested for impairment when\nTable of Content\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. A decrease in our market capitalization or profitability or unfavorable changes in market, economic and industry conditions all would increase the risk of impairment.\nWe have three reporting units and perform a goodwill impairment test at a reporting unit level on an annual basis on December 1 of each year and, as discussed above, whenever there are sufficient indicators that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.\nAs a result of revenue and earnings declines and sustained declined in our stock price through September 30, 2021, we determined that a triggering event had occurred as it was more likely than not that the carrying values of our reporting units exceeded their fair values. Our revenue growth and profitability are influenced by several industry trend factors, including end markets capital spending levels, supply and demand levels and technology. With oil prices and demand increasing, refiners (represents approximately 40% of our customers) are recovering; however, capital expenditures have not fully recovered resulting in lower current activity and pricing pressure for our products and services. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment of the fair value of goodwill as of September 30, 2021.\nBased upon our impairment assessment, we determined the carrying amount of our MS reporting unit exceeded the fair value. As a result, we recorded $55.8 million in goodwill impairment charges on our MS reporting unit during the three months ended September 30, 2021. The fair value of the Quest Integrity reporting unit exceeded its carrying value at September 30, 2021. Our IHT reporting unit has no goodwill associated as it was determined to be fully impaired on March 31, 2020.\nFor our annual goodwill impairment test as of December 1, 2021, we elected to perform a quantitative assessment to determine if it was more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its carrying value as of the test date. Based on the quantitative assessment, we concluded that the carrying amount of our Quest Integrity reporting unit exceeded the fair value. As a result, we recorded $8.8 million in goodwill impairment charges on our Quest Integrity reporting unit during the three months ended December 31, 2021.\nGAAP requires that we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets subject to amortization each reporting period. If the estimate of an intangible asset\u2019s remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. To the extent the revised useful life of an intangible asset is less than originally estimated, our future amortization expense will increase, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nImprovements in operating results from expected savings in operating costs from workforce reductions and other cost saving and business improvement initiatives may not be realized in the estimated amounts, may take longer to be realized, or could be realized only for a limited period. In 2017 through the first quarter of 2021, we developed and implemented a project known as OneTEAM, an assessment of all aspects of our business, including international operations, for improvement and cost saving opportunities. In January 2021, we announced a new strategic organizational structure to better position ourselves for the recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic, continue service diversification, and enhance client value. These organizational changes resulted in restructuring charges and other cost saving opportunities. However, in order to implement this or any other future cost savings or business improvement initiatives, we expect to incur additional expenses, which could adversely impact our financial results prior to the realization of the expected benefits associated with the initiatives. Due to numerous factors or future developments, we may not achieve cost reductions or other business improvements consistent with our expectations or the benefits may be delayed. These factors or future developments could include (i) the incurrence of higher than expected costs or delays in reassigning and retraining remaining employees or outsourcing or eliminating duties and functions of eliminated employees, (ii) unanticipated delays in discharging employees in eliminated positions as a result of regulatory or legal limitations on employee terminations in certain jurisdictions, (iii) actual savings differing from anticipated cost savings, (iv) anticipated benefits from business improvement initiatives not materializing and (v) disruptions to normal operations or other unintended adverse impacts resulting from the initiatives.\nWe may also decide to reduce, suspend or terminate our cost saving and business improvement initiatives at any time before achieving the estimated benefits or after a limited period of time. The elimination of current employees can also result in increased future costs in hiring, training and mobilizing new employees or rehires in the event of a future increase in demand for our services resulting in a slower recovery of results from operations. Our initiatives may negatively affect our ability to retain and attract qualified personnel, who may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us.\nWe may experience inflationary pressures in our operating costs and cost overruns on our projects. A number of our clients are serviced under fixed price contracts or contracts including a combination of fixed and variable elements, where we bear a portion of the risk for cost overruns. Under such contracts, prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates, which are based on a number of assumptions, including assumptions about future economic conditions, prices and availability of subcontractors, materials and other exigencies of our services. Our profitability depends heavily on our ability to make accurate estimates. Inaccurate estimates, or changes in other circumstances, such as unanticipated technical problems, difficulties obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, cost of raw materials,\nTable of Content\ntrade disputes and tariffs, currency fluctuations, inflation pressures or our suppliers' or subcontractors' inability to perform could result in substantial losses, as such changes adversely affect the revenues recognized on each project.\nAdditionally, we may incur significant costs in excess of estimates due to changes to any work orders requested by our clients materially changing the scope of work to be completed by us. Our services are usually performed pursuant to purchase orders issued under written client agreements. We may be required to perform additional services that were not contemplated in the pricing related to any such purchaser order, including services resulting from client requested changes, incomplete or inaccurate engineering, changes in project specifications and other similar information provided to us by the client which form the basis for our original estimates. We recognize revenue proportionately as costs are incurred, therefore, we may be required to adjusted revenue recognize on fixed contract projects in the event we incur actual costs in excess of our estimates for such project if we are unable to obtain adequate compensation for any such additional services.\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international operations could adversely affect our business. A portion of our operations are conducted and located outside the U.S., and accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, instability in political or economic conditions, difficulty in repatriating cash proceeds, differing employee relations, differing regulatory environments, trade protection measures, and difficulty in administering and enforcing corporate policies which may be different than the normal business practices of local cultures. Our international business operations may include projects in countries where corruption is prevalent. Although we have, and continue to, implement and enforce policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors or agents, including those representing us in countries where practices which violate such anti-corruption laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies and procedures. Any violation of foreign or U.S. laws by our employees, contractors or agents, even if such violation is prohibited by our policies and procedures, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nBusiness acquisitions and divestitures entail risk for investors. From time to time, we seek growth through strategic acquisitions while also evaluating our portfolio for potential divestitures in, or complementary to, the specialty maintenance and specialty industrial services, including inspection, engineering assessment and mechanical services to complement, diversify or rationalize our existing business. We may also acquire other businesses that enhance our services or geographic scope and/or divest certain businesses or service offerings to rationalize our operations and take advantage of strategic opportunities. We may not be able to expand our market presence through acquisitions, and acquisitions may present unforeseen integration difficulties or costs. No assurances can be made that we will realize the cost savings, synergies or revenue enhancements that we may anticipate from any acquisition or divestiture, or that we will realize such benefits within the time frame that we expect. If we are not able to address the challenges associated with acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses, or if our integrated product and service offerings fail to achieve market acceptance, or if we are not able to successfully separate divested operations, our business could be adversely affected. The transactions may also affect our share price or future financial results depending on the structure of such considerations. To the extent we issue stock or other rights to purchase stock, including options or other rights, existing shareholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of additional debt.\nThe price of our outstanding securities may be volatile. It is possible that in some future quarter (or quarters) our revenues, operating results or other measures of financial performance will not meet the expectations of investors, which could cause the price of our outstanding securities to decline or be volatile. Historically, our quarterly and annual sales and operating results have fluctuated. We expect fluctuations to continue in the future. In addition to general economic and political conditions, and in addition to the other factors identified under this Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, the following factors may affect our sales and operating results: the timing of significant client orders, the timing of planned maintenance projects at client facilities, changes in competitive pricing, wide variations in profitability by product line, variations in operating expenses, rapid increases in raw material and labor costs, the timing of announcements or introductions of new products or services by us, our competitors or our respective clients, the acceptance of those services, our ability to adequately meet staffing requirements with qualified personnel, relative variations in manufacturing efficiencies and costs, and the relative strength or weakness of international markets. Since our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results vary, we believe that period-to-period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages, staffing shortages and other labor matters. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good and we have had no strikes or work stoppages, no assurances can be made that we will not experience these and other types of conflicts with labor unions, works councils, other groups representing employees, or our employees in general, or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor.\nWe extend credit to clients for purchases of our services which subjects us to potential credit risk that could, if realized, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to collect amounts owed to us, or retain amounts paid to us, our cash flows would be reduced and we could experience losses. We would also\nTable of Content\nrecognize losses with respect to any receivables that are impaired as a result of our clients\u2019 financial difficulties or bankruptcies. The risk of loss may increase for capital projects where we provide services over a longer period of time. Credit losses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of our geographically diverse and decentralized operations within the United States and other countries around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks. We have offices and operations throughout the world. This creates greater financial and operational risks due to the nature of our operations being conducted at various locations. While we have robust internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices, they may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations.\nRisks Related to Financing Our Business\nWe are subject to risks associated with indebtedness under our credit facilities, including the risk of failure to maintain compliance with financial covenants, the risk of being unable to make interest and principal payments when due and the risk of rising interest rates. Additionally, due to our significant debt and high leverage there could be a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position.\nWe have a significant amount of debt as discussed below, and our overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes;\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy the terms of our debt obligations;\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to manage increases in interest rates;\n\u2022limit our ability to refinance our existing debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements; and\n\u2022subject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition.\nOur ability to meet expenses and debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. If we do not generate enough cash to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise additional equity capital.\nOn December 18, 2020, we entered into an asset-based credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) led by Citibank, N.A., as agent, which provides for available borrowings up to $150.0 million (the \u201cABL Facility\u201d). The ABL Facility matures and all outstanding amounts become due and payable on December 18, 2024. However, if our Notes, which mature on August 1, 2023, have an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million (updated from $50.0 million to $10.0 million as part of the Third Amendment to the Term Loan) or more outstanding 120 days prior to their maturity date (the \u201cTrigger Date\u201d), or if there are Notes in an aggregate principal amount of less than $10.0 million outstanding and we do not have sufficient excess availability of more than 20% under the ABL Facility on the Trigger Date, the ABL Facility will terminate on the Trigger Date.\nOn December 7, 2021, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 (the \u201cABL Amendment No. 2\u201d) to the Credit Agreement. ABL Amendment No. 2, among other things, (i) revises the applicable margin to 4.25% for LIBOR rate advances, (ii) provides that at all times beginning on the effective date of the ABL Amendment No. 2 and ending on the date Citibank shall have received and approved the borrowing base certificate for the calendar month ending December 31, 2021, the borrowing base shall not exceed the lesser of (a) the borrowing base calculated as set forth in the borrowing base certificate for the calendar month ending December 31, 2021 and (b) $108,500,000, (iii) establishes an interest reserve account for certain payments due under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, (iv) provides that after giving effect to any borrowing and any disbursements to be made by the Company with the proceeds of such borrowing, within one business day of such borrowing, the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries may not have more than $5.0 million cash on hand, (v) provides for weekly variance testing to be delivered to Citibank, (vi) requires the Company to have used all of the proceeds borrowed under the Subordinated Term Loan Credit Agreement prior to borrowing under the Credit Agreement, and (vii) increases the amount of subordinated debt available to be incurred by the Company to account for (a) the additional $27.5 million borrowed under the Subordinated Term Loan Credit Agreement, (b) any additional amount borrowed under the Subordinated Term Loan Credit Agreement not to exceed $75.0 million in the aggregate, and (c) the payment of interest in the form of payment-in-kind interest with respect to the Initial Term Loans (as defined in the Subordinated Term Loan Credit Agreement).\nTable of Content\nThe ABL Facility contains customary conditions to borrowings, events of default and covenants. In the event that our excess availability is less than the greater of (i) $15.0 million and (ii) 10.00% of the lesser of (1) the current borrowing base and (2) the commitments under the ABL Facility then in effect, a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00 must be maintained. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, an additional 2.0% interest maybe required on the outstanding loans under the ABL Facility.\nOn February 11, 2022, we entered into a new credit agreement with the lender parties thereto, and Eclipse Business Capital, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as agent, (\u201cEclipse\u201d) (such agreement, the \u201cABL Credit Agreement\u201d). Available funding commitments to us under the ABL Credit Agreement, subject to certain conditions, include a revolving credit line in an amount of up to $130.0 million to be provided by certain affiliates of Eclipse (the \u201cRevolving Credit Loans\u201d), with a $35.0 million sublimit for swingline borrowings and a $26.0 million sublimit for issuances of letters of credit, and an incremental delayed draw term loan of up to $35.0 million (the \u201cDelayed Draw Term Loans\u201d) to be provided by Corre Partners Management, LLC and certain of its affiliates (\u201cCorre\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cABL Credit Facility\u201d). The ABL Credit Facility matures and all outstanding amounts become due and payable on February 11, 2025, however, the ABL Credit Facility is subject to the Trigger Date as defined above. The proceeds of the loans under the ABL Credit Facility were used to, among other things, pay off the amounts owed under the Credit Agreement, which was repaid and terminated in full on February 11, 2022.\nRevolving Credit Loans bear interest through maturity at a variable rate based upon an annual rate of a LIBOR Rate (or a Base Rate (as defined below) if the LIBOR Rate is unavailable for any reason), plus an applicable margin (\u201cLIBOR Rate Loan\u201d and \u201cBase Rate Loan\u201d, respectively). The \u201cBase Rate\u201d is defined as a fluctuating interest rate equal to the greatest of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (2) Wells Fargo Bank, National Association\u2019s prime rate, and (3) the one-month LIBOR Rate. The \u201capplicable margin\u201d is defined as a rate of 3.15%, 3.40% or 3.65% for Base Rate Loans with a 2.00% Base Rate floor and a rate of 4.15%, 4.40% or 4.65% for LIBOR Rate Loans with a 1.00% LIBOR floor, in each case depending on the amount of EBITDA as of the most recent measurement period, as reported in a monthly compliance certificate. The Delayed Draw Term Loans shall bear interest through maturity at a rate of the LIBOR Rate plus 10.0%, with a 1.00% LIBOR floor. The fee for undrawn revolving amounts is 0.50% and the fee for undrawn Delayed Draw Term Loan amounts is 3.00%. Interest under the ABL Credit Facility is payable monthly. We will also be required to pay customary letter of credit fees, as necessary. The Company may make voluntary prepayments of the loans under the ABL Credit Facility from time to time, subject, in the case of the Delayed Draw Term Loans, to certain conditions. Mandatory prepayments are also required in certain circumstances, including with respect to the Delayed Draw Term Loan, if the ratio of aggregate value of the collateral under the ABL Credit Facility to the sum of the delayed draw term loans plus revolving facility usage outstanding is less than 130%. Amounts repaid may be re-borrowed, subject to compliance with the borrowing base and the other conditions set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement, subject, in the case of the Delayed Draw Term Loans to a maximum of four such borrowings in any 12-month period. Certain permanent repayments of the ABL Credit Facility loans are subject to the payment of a premium of 2.00% during the first year of the facility, 1.00% during the second year of the facility, and 0.50% in the last year of the facility. The ABL Credit Agreement contains customary conditions to borrowings and covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to sell assets, make changes to the nature of our business, engage in mergers or acquisitions, incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness and guarantees, create or permit to exist liens, pay dividends, issue equity instruments, make distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock or make other investments, engage in transactions with affiliates and make payments in respect of certain debt. The ABL Credit Agreement also requires that we will not exceed $20.0 million in unfinanced capital expenditures in any calendar year; provided that this requirement will not apply if we maintain a net leverage ratio of less than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00 as of the end of the second and fourth fiscal quarter of each calendar year. In addition, the ABL Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, the occurrence of which may require that we pay an additional 2.0% interest on the outstanding loans under the ABL Credit Agreement.\nOn December 18, 2020, we also entered into a credit agreement with Atlantic Park Strategic Capital Fund, L.P., as agent, and APSC Holdco II, L.P. (\u201cAPSC\u201d), as lender (the \u201cTerm Loan Credit Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which we borrowed a $250.0 million term loan (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d). The Term Loan matures, and all outstanding amounts become due and payable on December 18, 2026, provided that certain conditions could result in an earlier maturity, including if the Notes have an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $10.0 million or more on the Trigger Date, in which case the Term Loan will terminate on the Trigger Date.\nOn February 11, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 6 (the \u201cSixth Amendment\u201d) to the Term Loan Credit Agreement. The Sixth Amendment, among other things and subject to the terms thereof, (i) permits the entry into the ABL Credit Agreement, (ii) permits certain interest payments due under the Term Loan Credit Agreement to be paid in kind, (iii) permits certain asset sales and requires certain related mandatory prepayments, subject to an applicable prepayment premium, and (iv) amends the financial covenants, such that the maximum net leverage ratio of 7.00 to 1.00 will not be tested until the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023, and the Company is not permitted to exceed $20.0 million in unfinanced capital expenditures in any calendar year; provided, that this unfinanced capital expenditures requirement will not apply if the Company maintains a net leverage ratio of less than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00 as of the end of the second and fourth fiscal quarter of each calendar year.\nTable of Content\nOn November 9, 2021, we entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cSubordinated Term Loan Credit Agreement\u201d) with Corre Credit Fund, LLC (\u201cCorre Fund\u201d), as agent, and the lenders party thereto providing for an unsecured $50.0 million delayed draw subordinated term loan facility (the \u201cSubordinated Term Loan\u201d). Pursuant to the Subordinated Term Loan Credit Agreement, we borrowed $22.5 million on November 9, 2021, and an additional $27.5 million on December 8, 2021. The Subordinated Term Loan matures, and all outstanding amounts become due and payable, on the earlier of December 31, 2026 and the date that is two weeks later than the maturity or full repayment of the Term Loan. The stated interest rate on the Subordinated Term Loan is 12%.\nOn February 11, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 5 (the \u201cCorre Amendment 5\u201d) to the Subordinated Term Loan Credit Agreement with the lenders from time to time party thereto (including Corre), and Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, as agent. The Corre Amendment 5, among other things, (i) provides for an additional commitment of $10.0 million in subordinated delayed draw term loans to be available for borrowing by the Company until July 1, 2022, (ii) permits the entry into the ABL Credit Facility, (iii) permits certain asset sales and requires certain related mandatory prepayments, subject to an applicable prepayment premium, and (iv) amends the financial covenants, such that the maximum net leverage ratio of 7.00 to 1.00 will not be tested until the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023, and the Company is not permitted to exceed $20.0 million in unfinanced capital expenditures in any calendar year; provided, that this unfinanced capital expenditures requirement will not apply if the Company maintains a net leverage ratio of less than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00 as of the end of the second and fourth fiscal quarter of each calendar year.\nOur ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants is dependent upon our future operating performance and future financial condition, both of which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related economic repercussions could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position and business condition, as well as our clients and suppliers. Additionally, these events may, among other factors, impact our ability to generate cash flows from operations, access the capital markets on acceptable terms or at all, and affect our future need or ability to borrow under our ABL Credit Facility. In addition to our current sources of funding our business, the effects of such events may impact our liquidity or our need to revise our allocation or sources of capital, implement further cost reduction measures and/or change our business strategy. Although the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions could have a broad range of effects on our liquidity sources, the effects will depend on future developments and cannot be predicted at this time.\nWe rely primarily on cash flows from our operations to make required interest and principal payments on our debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations, we may be unable to pay interest and principal obligations on our debt when they become due. Failure to comply with these obligations or failure to comply with the financial covenants discussed above could result in an event of default, which would permit our lenders to accelerate the repayment of the debt. If our lenders accelerate the repayment of debt, there is no assurance that we could refinance such debt on terms favorable to us or at all.\nOur ABL Facility and Term Loan bear interest at variable market rates. If market interest rates increase, our interest expense and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Based on borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2021, an increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points would increase our interest expense and decrease our operating cash flows by approximately $3.1 million on an annual basis.\nOur ABL Credit Facility and Term Loan restrict our ability to, among other items, incur additional indebtedness, engage in mergers, acquisitions and dispositions and alter the business conducted by us. These restrictions could adversely affect our ability to operate our businesses and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.\nWe may not be able to continue as a going concern. We have suffered recurring operating losses related to the COVID pandemic, related economic repercussions, and difficult market conditions and prior to the Recent Financing Transactions discussed below, the Company required additional liquidity to continue its operations over the next twelve months. During the year, revenues and margins continued to decline against forecast along with margin pressures from inflationary costs including labor, materials, and transportation resulting in further operating losses. As of December 31, 2021, we are in compliance with our debt covenants; however, our financial forecasts as of December 31, 2021 indicated insufficient cash flows from operations to address our near-term liquidity needs and maintain compliance with our debt covenants within one year following the date that our financial statements are issued.\nAs discussed in Note 1 - Recent Financing Transactions, on February 11, 2022, the Company successfully closed on financing transactions that provided improved liquidity and runway to execute on the business turnaround, support working capital needs and pursue potential strategic alternatives. Following the Recent Financing Transactions, we evaluated the Company\u2019s liquidity within one year after the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements to determine if there is substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. In the preparation of this liquidity assessment, we applied judgment to estimate the projected cash flows of the Company, including the following: (i) projected cash outflows, (ii) projected cash inflows, and (iii) excess availability level under the Company\u2019s existing debt arrangements. The cash flow projections were based on known or planned cash requirements for operating and financing costs. We believe, based on the\nTable of Content\nCompany\u2019s forecast, that current working capital and capital expenditure financing is sufficient to fund the operations, maintain compliance with our debt covenants, and satisfy the Company\u2019s obligations as they come due within one year after the date of issuance of these financial statements. While the Recent Financing Transactions provide us with additional funding to meet our near-term liquidity needs and included a waiver of our debt covenants through March 31, 2023, there can be no assurance that (i) our lenders will provide additional waivers or amendments in the event of future non-compliance with our debt covenants, or other possible events of default that could happen, or (ii) that we will generate adequate liquidity to fund our operations, or to satisfy the obligations under our convertible debt and potential acceleration of debt maturities that may become due on April 3, 2023 related to the Trigger Date.\nThe accounting method for our convertible debt securities may have a material effect on our reported financial results. On July 31, 2017 we issued $230.0 million principal amount of 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 in a private offering. In December 2020, we retired $136.9 million par value of our Notes for $135.5 million, excluding accrued interest, using proceeds from the Term Loan and borrowings under the ABL Facility. As of December 31, 2021, the principal amount of Notes outstanding was $93.1 million.\nConvertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method if we have the ability and intent to settle in cash, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount and if the effect would be dilutive. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that we will be able to demonstrate the ability or intent to settle the Notes in cash in any future reporting period. Additionally, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) has recently issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity, which will eliminate the use of the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share. We expect to adopt ASU 2020-06 beginning January 1, 2022, at which time we would utilize the if-converted method, which would require us to assume the Notes would be settled entirely in shares of common stock for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, if the effect would be dilutive. In such case, our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nTransactions relating to our convertible debt securities may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock. The Notes are convertible into 4,291,705 shares of common stock. Upon conversion, we may settle the Notes in cash or in shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, in each case, at our election. If the Notes are converted, our current intent is to settle the principal amount of the Notes in cash and settle the remainder of our conversion obligation by issuing shares of common stock; however, we cannot guarantee that we will have sufficient funds available to us at the time of any such conversions in order to effect settlement in that manner. In such case, we could elect to settle the conversion obligation in a different combination of cash and shares of common stock or entirely in shares of common stock, depending on the circumstances. To the extent we deliver shares of common stock upon conversion of the Notes, the ownership interests of existing stockholders would be diluted. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Information Systems\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks or deficiencies in our cyber-security or those of third-party providers. In the ordinary course of our business, we continue to increase dependencies on digital technologies to conduct our business. Sensitive data is also transmitted on our networks and systems, including our intellectual property and proprietary information that is confidential to the business, to our customers and our business partners. We have also outsourced significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, third parties may or could have access to our confidential information. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, ransomware, cyber fraud, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, encrypted, lost or stolen. Any such access, inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information or other loss of information, including our data being breached at third-party providers, could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or financial loss under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disruption of our operations with increases in costs and decline in revenues, damage to intellectual property or our product development programs and damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\nTable of Content\nFurthermore, we and our third-party providers rely on electronic communications and information system to conduct our operations. We and our third-party providers have been, and may continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent e-mails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate bank accounting information, passwords, or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware to our information systems. We currently maintain an insurance related to cybersecurity breaches and are exploring a range of steps to enhance our security protections and prevent future unauthorized activity. Though we endeavor to mitigate these threats, cyber-attacks against us or our third-party providers and business partners remain a serious issue. The pervasiveness of cybersecurity incidents in general and the risks of cyber-crime are complex and continue to evolve. Fortunately, our cybersecurity posture continued to improve in 2021. One of the legacy ERP systems was migrated into the Company\u2019s main US ERP system, and several aging applications on our externally facing firewalls were upgraded. However, a number of other ERP systems are out of vendor support with no assurance that our security efforts will be effective or that security breaches would not be damaging.\nInterruptions in the proper functioning of our information systems could disrupt operations and cause increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues. The proper functioning of our information systems is critical to the successful operation of our business. Although our information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards, our information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, telecommunication failures and other problems. If critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable, our business operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Regulations\nFluctuations in our effective tax rate and our tax obligations could adversely affect our financial results. We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision, which includes assessing the restrictions on tax credits, offset gains or repatriation of cash proceeds, tax assets and accruals for other taxes, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by our profit levels, changes in our business, reorganization of our business and operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the elections we make, changes in applicable tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws or changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, as well as other factors.\nWe are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods.\nOur operations and properties are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulations. We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to the environment, and worker health and safety, among other things. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, are becoming increasingly stringent, and can impose substantial sanctions for violations or require operational changes that may limit our services. We must conform our operations to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and adapt to changes in such requirements in all locations in which we operate. These requirements can be expected to increase the overall costs of providing our services over time. Some of our services involve handling or monitoring highly regulated materials, including volatile organic compounds or hazardous wastes. Environmental laws and regulations generally impose limitations and standards for the characterization, handling, disposal, discharge or emission of regulated materials and require us to obtain permits and comply with various other requirements. The improper characterization, handling, or disposal of regulated materials or any other failure by us to comply with increasingly complex and strictly-enforced federal, state, local, and international environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or associated permits could subject us to the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations or capital expenditure requirements, or the issuance of injunctions that could restrict or prevent our ability to operate our business and complete contracted services. A defect in our services or faulty workmanship could result in an environmental liability if, as a result of the defect or faulty workmanship, a contaminant is released into the environment. In addition, the modification or interpretation of existing environmental, health and safety laws or regulations, the more vigorous enforcement of existing laws or regulations, or the adoption of new laws or regulations may also negatively impact industries in which our clients operate, which in turn could have a negative impact on us.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in reduced demand for our services and products. There has been an increased focus in the last several years on climate change in response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment. As a result, there have been a variety of regulatory developments, proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced in the U.S. and other parts of the world that are focused on restricting the emission of greenhouse gases. The new Presidential administration has also emphasized its intention to actively pursue its policy goals of addressing global climate change through significant economy-wide reductions in greenhouse gases and hastening the transition from carbon-based energy sources. The adoption of new or more stringent legislation or regulatory programs limiting\nTable of Content\ngreenhouse gas emissions from clients, particularly those in refining and petrochemical industries, for whom we provide repair and maintenance services, or reducing the demand for those clients\u2019 products, could in turn affect demand for our products and services. Some of our clients are modifying their plants and facilities in efforts to better align their operations and products with these energy transition issues, but there is no assurance that such modified facilities will require the same level of services and product that we currently provide.\nFinally, some scientists have concluded that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere may produce physical effects, such as increased severity and frequency of storms, droughts, floods and other climate events. Such climate events have the potential to adversely affect our operations or those of our clients, which in turn could have a negative effect on us. Such events, if increasing in their severity and frequency, may also adversely affect our ability to insure against the risks associated with such events, thus leading to greater financial risk for us in the conduct of our operations against the backdrop of such events.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s (the \u201cU.K.\u201d) departure from the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d) could adversely affect us. On January 31, 2020, the U.K. departed from the EU (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) and the effects of the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the EU have been and are expected to continue to be far-reaching.\nThe outcome of Brexit caused volatility in global stock markets and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and uncertainty about the terms and impact of Brexit may continue to do so in the future. Brexit could adversely affect U.K., regional European and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro, which in turn could adversely affect our clients, particularly in the U.K. Given these possibilities and others we may not anticipate, as well as the lack of comparable precedent, Brexit and the perceptions as to its potential impact may continue to adversely affect business activity and economic conditions. It could also lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any potential negative effects and the full extent to which our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected by Brexit is uncertain.\nWe are subject to privacy and data security/protection laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the payment of potentially significant fines or penalties in the event of a breach or other privacy and information security laws, as well as the negative publicity associated with such a breach, could damage our reputation and adversely impact product demand and client relationships.\nRisks Related to Legal Liability\nOur insurance coverage will not fully indemnify us against certain claims or losses. Further, our insurance has limits and exclusions and not all losses or claims are insured. We perform services in hazardous environments on or around high-pressure, high temperature systems and our employees are exposed to a number of hazards, including exposure to hazardous materials, explosion hazards and fire hazards. Incidents that occur at these large industrial facilities or systems, regardless of fault, may be catastrophic and adversely impact our employees and third parties by causing serious personal injury, loss of life, damage to property or the environment, and interruption of operations. Our contracts typically require us to indemnify our clients for injury, damage or loss arising out of our presence at our clients\u2019 location, regardless of fault, or the performance of our services and provide for warranties for materials and workmanship. We may also be required to name the client as an additional insured under our insurance policies. We maintain limited insurance coverage against these and other risks associated with our business. Due to the high cost of general liability coverage, we maintain insurance with a self-insured retention of $1.0 million and a deductible of $2.0 million per occurrence. This insurance may not protect us against liability for certain events, including events involving pollution, product or professional liability, losses resulting from business interruption or acts of terrorism or damages from our breach of contract. We cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate in risk coverage or policy limits to cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur. Moreover, in the future, due to evolving market conditions, our higher risk profile due to the nature of our operations and claims history, and expected impact on pricing, we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any future damages caused by our products or services that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nWe are involved and are likely to continue to be involved in legal proceedings, which will increase our costs and, if adversely determined, could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We are currently a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the operation of our business and it is reasonable to expect that we will be named in future actions. Most of the legal proceedings against us arise out of the normal course of performing services at client facilities, and include claims for workers\u2019 compensation, personal injury and property damage. Legal proceedings can be\nTable of Content\nexpensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful defense of a liability claim could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOther risk factors may include interruption of our operations, or the operations of our clients due to fire, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, power loss, war, political or civil unrest, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, labor disruptions, health epidemics and other events beyond our control.\nAny of these factors, individually or in combination, could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and/or stock price and could also affect whether any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ultimately prove to be accurate.\nTable of Content", "PERMNO": 65752, "SIC": 8734, "TIC": "TISI"}
