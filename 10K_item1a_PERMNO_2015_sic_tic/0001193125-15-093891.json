{"cik": "868725", "company": "RENTECH, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below are certain risk factors related to our business. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated as a result of these and various other factors, including those set forth in our other periodic and current reports filed with the SEC, from time to time. If any risks or uncertainties develop into an actual event, our business, financial condition, cash flow or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Wood Fibre Processing Business\nWe face competition from other wood fibre processing businesses.\nWe have a number of competitors in the wood fibre processing business in the United States and in other countries. Our wood chipping business\u2019s principal competitors include major domestic and foreign biomass supply companies and paper and pulp manufacturers, our industrial wood pellet business\u2019s principal competitors include major domestic and foreign biomass supply companies, and we have a number of competitors in our residential and commercial wood pellet business. Some competitors have greater total resources, or better name recognition, and are less dependent on earnings from those businesses, which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities. Our competitive position could suffer to the extent that we are not able to adapt or expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions, joint ventures or partnerships. An inability to compete successfully in the wood fibre processing business could result in the loss of customers, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability. In addition, as a result of increased pricing pressures in the wood fibre processing business caused by competition, we may in the future experience reductions in our profit margins on sales, or may be unable to pass future input price increases on to our customers, which would reduce our cash flows.\nWe have experienced difficulties in constructing our Canadian wood pellet facilities. We may face further difficulties in the future and may not be successful in growing our wood fibre processing businesses.\nWe have experienced difficulties in completing the construction of the Wawa Project and Atikokan Project, including significant cost overruns and delays. We intend to grow our wood fibre processing businesses organically through these and future projects and through strategic investments, expansion projects and/or acquisitions. However, our success in growing these businesses is subject to various risks, including the other risks described in this report. We cannot assure you that we will be successful and, in the event that we are unable to achieve the growth in these businesses that we desire, this would limit our returns and our ability to realize upon the investments we have made, including through any initial public offering of such businesses. Accordingly, any failure to achieve the growth we intend to achieve in these businesses would have a material adverse effect on our prospects.\nWe could face significant difficulties in completing the development and commencing operation of the Atikokan Project, the Wawa Project and future projects, which could result in cost overruns and delays. These difficulties could include, among others:\n\u2022\nunforeseen engineering problems or unavailability or failure of necessary equipment;\n\u2022\nweather interference;\n\u2022\nincrease in development costs and delay due to transporting machinery and equipment, and construction personnel to remote sites;\n\u2022\nincrease in development costs due to unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar;\n\u2022\nadded expense and time due to potential infrastructure upgrades needed, but currently unknown, at the sites;\n\u2022\nstrain on us to properly monitor activities in rural areas outside the United States;\n\u2022\nadded expense to us to establish and enforce proper controls and safety procedures at the sites;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain necessary permits;\n\u2022\nexpenditures related to the cost of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and standards; and\n\u2022\ndifficulty in hiring and retaining qualified personnel.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the development of these projects or future projects on budget and on time. Any failure by us to complete these projects could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, in connection with the Fulghum Acquisition, we and Graanul Invest AS, or Graanul, entered into a joint venture for the potential development and construction of, and investment in, wood pellet facilities in the United States and Canada. Pursuant to the terms of the parties\u2019 Joint Venture Agreement, until the earliest of: (i) May 1, 2018, (ii) the date on which either we or Graanul (together with its respective affiliates) ceases to hold at least 20% of the total interests in the joint venture, and (iii) the date on which the joint venture and its subsidiaries have projects producing an aggregate annual name plate capacity of 1,250,000 metric tons of wood pellets (referred to as the \u201cexclusivity period\u201d), we and our affiliates are prohibited from constructing any new wood pellet mills in the United States or Canada unless we first offer the joint venture the opportunity to construct and own such project. During the exclusivity period, we and our affiliates must also offer Graanul the opportunity to acquire a 50% equity interest of mills we acquire in the United States or Canada. To the extent that the exercise of these rights of first refusal will require negotiation with Graanual regarding the construction or acquisition of wood pellet facilities, these rights of first refusal could complicate, delay or prohibit the successful construction or acquisition of those facilities.\nOur acquisition strategy involves significant risks.\nOne of our business strategies is to pursue acquisitions in our wood fibre processing businesses. However, acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including intense competition for suitable acquisition targets, the potential unavailability of financial resources necessary to consummate acquisitions, difficulties in identifying suitable acquisition targets or in completing any transactions identified on sufficiently favorable terms, and the need to obtain regulatory or other governmental approvals that may be necessary to complete acquisitions. In addition, any future acquisitions may entail significant transaction costs, tax consequences and risks associated with entry into new markets and lines of business.\nIn addition to the risks involved in identifying and completing acquisitions described above, even when acquisitions are completed, integration of acquired entities can involve significant difficulties, such as:\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties in the acquired operations and disruption of the ongoing operations of our business;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve cost savings or other financial or operating objectives with respect to an acquisition;\n\u2022\nstrain on the operational and managerial controls and procedures of our business, and the need to modify systems or to add management resources;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration and retention of customers or personnel and the integration and effective deployment of operations or technologies;\n\u2022\nassumption of unknown material liabilities or regulatory non-compliance issues;\n\u2022\namortization of acquired assets, which would reduce future reported earnings;\n\u2022\npossible adverse short-term effects on our cash flows or operating results;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from the ongoing operations of our business; and\n\u2022\nthe use of cash and other resources for the acquisition that might affect our liquidity, and that could have been used for other purposes.\nFailure to manage wood fibre acquisition growth risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate any wood fibre acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired entities, or generate positive cash flow at any acquired company.\nOur wood chipping business depends, in significant part, on continued demand from the board, paper, pulp and packaging industry. Any decline in demand for our services from this industry could have a negative impact on us.\nOur wood chipping business provides services to manufacturers of boxboard, container board, paper, pulp and similar products. Any decline in the industries in which these manufacturers participate could, in turn, have a negative impact on us. Some of the risks relating to this industry include:\n\u2022\nConsumption of writing and printing paper products has declined recently as a result of technological advances and the development of substitutes for paper products. The continuation of this trend could adversely impact our business in Chile and Uruguay that provides a significant amount of services to paper manufacturers; and\n\u2022\nIf the price of wood increases, this would negatively impact the businesses of our customers that supply wood to us for processing. Currently, all of our customers in the United States are responsible for the cost of wood used in our operations.\nIn the event that our wood chipping business experiences a decline as a result of these factors or otherwise, this would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have contracted to sell a significant portion of our industrial wood pellets from the Atikokan and Wawa Facilities pursuant to our off-take contracts with Drax and OPG. We expect to sell the remaining portion of our industrial wood pellets from the Atikokan and Wawa Facilities in spot market arrangements rather than through off-take contracts. If either the Drax or OPG contract is terminated, or if market pricing for industrial wood pellets falls substantially, this likely would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have entered into a ten-year off-take contract with Drax under which we are required to sell to Drax the first 400,000 metric tonnes of wood pellets per year produced from our Wawa Facility, and we have entered into a ten-year off-take contract with OPG under which we are required to deliver 45,000 metric tonnes of wood pellets annually. OPG has the option to increase the amount of wood pellets we are required to deliver under the contract to up to 90,000 metric tonnes annually. Under each of the off-take contracts, Drax and OPG have the right to terminate the contracts for specified reasons. For example, under the Drax Contract, in the event of certain changes to legislation in the UK relating to sustainability, each party may require the other to be financially responsible for half of the costs of such change in an amount up to $2.50 per tonne of wood pellets. In the event that the cost of such changes exceeds such cap, then either party may terminate the contract. We expect to sell the remaining portion of our industrial wood pellets from the Atikokan and Wawa Facilities in spot market arrangements rather than through off-take contracts. If either the Drax or OPG contract is terminated, or if market pricing for industrial wood pellets falls substantially, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnfavorable changes in exchange rates could adversely affect us.\nWe are incurring expenses in Canadian dollars, and have contracted to sell a significant portion of our industrial wood pellets pursuant to off-take contracts under which the purchases are priced in Canadian dollars. As a result, we are subject to the effects of changing rates of exchange for the relevant currencies. Both the expenses we incur outside the United States and the value to our shareholders of future profits earned in foreign currencies may be affected by such exchange rates.\nFor financial statement reporting purposes, we translate the assets and liabilities of our Canadian subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date and translate their costs and expenses at the rates of exchange in effect at the time of the transaction. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders\u2019 equity section of our balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations. Since we translate Canadian dollars into United States dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future.\nWe may not be able to successfully negotiate industrial wood pellet off-take contracts in the future.\nIn connection with future industrial wood pellet projects, we expect to enter into long-term off-take contracts for the sale of wood pellets. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully negotiate off-take contracts on acceptable terms. Our ability to proceed with future wood pellet projects likely will depend on our ability to enter into off-take contracts for those projects. As a result, in the event that we are not able to enter into an off-take contract on satisfactory terms, this may prevent us from proceeding with the project and, in turn, materially adversely affect our business and growth prospects.\nWe have entered into various contracts relating to our Atikokan and Wawa Facilities, which will require us to pay penalties if we do not comply with their terms.\nUnder the Drax Contract, we are required to sell to Drax the first 400,000 metric tonnes of wood pellets per year produced from our Wawa Facility and, under the OPG contract, we are required to sell to OPG up to 90,000 metric tonnes of wood pellets per year. In the event that we do not deliver wood pellets as required under the contracts, we will be required to pay an amount equal to\nthe difference between the contract price for the wood pellets and the price of any wood pellets purchased in replacement. For 2014, we did not meet the contracted delivery schedule under the Drax Contract. We have amended the Drax Contract to cancel all wood pellet deliveries that were due in 2014 and to reduce the required volume of wood pellets to be delivered to Drax in 2015 to 240,000 tonnes from 360,000 tonnes. In exchange for the cancelled deliveries and reduced volume commitments, we paid Drax a penalty of approximately $170,000 and expect to provide price concessions in the amount of $0.9 million on shipments made to Drax in 2015. In the event such shipments are not made, the price reductions will become cash penalties payable to Drax, in addition to other penalties that may be due under the Drax Contract for such failed deliveries. In addition, 72,000 tonnes of the original 2015 deliveries are being deferred to future years at 2015 pricing, which is expected to be lower than the pricing under the terms of the contract in those future years. In addition, each contract contains certain quality requirements, the failure of which to satisfy would give Drax or OPG the right to reject the wood pellets and to return them to us at our cost. We also have entered into a contract with Canadian National Railway Company for rail transportation of wood pellets from our Atikokan and Wawa Facilities to the Port of Quebec for delivery to Drax. Under the contract, we committed to transport a minimum of 1,500 rail carloads during the year ended December 31, 2014, and 3,600 rail carloads annually thereafter for the duration of the contract. For 2014, we did not meet the minimum requirements and, therefore, we are required to pay $0.5 million to Canadian National Railway Company. If we do not meet these commitments again in the future, we would be required to pay a penalty equal to $1,000 per rail car. We have entered into a lease agreement with TrinityRail Canada, Inc. under which we have committed to lease the required rail cars needed to satisfy our transportation requirements under the Drax Contract. Accordingly, in the event that we do not meet the commitments under the contracts described above, we will be required to pay penalties and other damages resulting from our failure to perform, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe will rely primarily on Crown Fibre from the Government of Ontario for our feedstock needs at our wood pellet facilities in Canada. In the event that we lose the right to Crown Fibre or we are otherwise unable to secure adequate supplies of wood fibre on acceptable terms, this would likely materially adversely affect operations at our Canadian wood pellet facilities.\nWe will use primarily Crown Fibre for our wood pellet facilities in Canada. Generally, obtaining Crown Fibre is a two-step process. First, the Government of Ontario must agree to make fibre available to us. At the Wawa Facility, we expect this will be achieved via multiple one to two year forest resource licenses. We expect to employ a similar strategy at our Atikokan Facility, except that we intend to enter into an Agreement for the Supply of Crown Forest Resources in the near term pursuant to which the Government of Ontario would make available to us 279,400 cubic meters of Crown Fibre annually for a 10 year term. There is no guarantee that the Government of Ontario will enter into or renew forest resource licenses as they expire. Further, there is no guarantee in the forest resource licenses or the Agreement for the Supply of Crown Forest Resources that the volumes contemplated therein will actually be available and the Government of Ontario reserves broad rights to modify and terminate such licenses and agreements.\nThe second step of our process for obtaining Crown Fibre is to enter into agreements with private parties that have existing rights over the forests from which the Government of Ontario has agreed to make Crown Fibre available to us. We expect that these agreements will provide us with the right to access and harvest or purchase the Crown Fibre made available to us by the Government of Ontario. While the private parties are statutorily required to make fibre available to parties such as us, the terms on which they make the fibre available may not be economical to us. As a result, we cannot assure you that will enter into such agreements on satisfactory terms or at all.\nIf the Government of Ontario ceases to make fibre available to us or we are unable to obtain the right to access and harvest or purchase Crown Fibre from the private parties on acceptable terms, we may attempt to make open market purchases of wood fibre to satisfy the feedstock needs for our Canadian wood pellet facilities. However, there is no guarantee that we would be able to secure a sufficient supply of wood fibre on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to secure adequate supplies of wood fibre on acceptable terms, this would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe expect to depend on third parties to deliver and harvest the timber we process at, and to transport the finished wood pellets from, our wood pellet facilities in Canada.\nWe expect to contract with independent harvesting companies to harvest and deliver timber to our Atikokan and Wawa Facilities. Under the contracts, we expect that the harvesting companies will be responsible for all elements of harvesting and transporting timber to our wood pellet facilities in Canada, including but not limited to building haul roads, surveying, scarification and block layout. The harvesting companies\u2019 ability to timely deliver timber to our facilities could be adversely impacted by various factors, including but not limited to the inability to build necessary roads on time, employee strikes, weather conditions or traffic accidents. In the event that the harvesting companies fail to deliver timber to our facilities on a timely basis, this would hinder our ability to produce wood pellets and, in turn, would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn connection with the delivery of finished wood pellets to Drax at the Port of Quebec, we have entered into (i) the Canadian National Contract for all rail transportation of wood pellets from the Atikokan Facility and the Wawa Facility to the Port of Quebec and (ii) a contract with QSL for our exclusive use of pellet storage domes and loading services at the Port of Quebec. The Atikokan Facility is located 1,300 track miles, and the Wawa Facility is located 1,100 track miles, from the Port of Quebec. In the event that either Canadian National or QSL fails to perform its respective obligations under the applicable contract, this could hinder, delay or prevent our ability to meet our contractual obligations with respect to delivery of wood pellets to Drax and, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe energy industry is highly competitive. Our wood pellet businesses may not successfully compete with other forms of energy.\nOur wood pellet businesses will face intense competition from well-established, conventional forms of energy, including petroleum, coal and natural gas. These forms of energy are abundant and widely accepted by consumers, and we may not be able to successfully compete with them. If we complete wood pellet projects and the price of these competing fuels declines as a result of the discovery of new deposits of oil, gas or coal or otherwise, this likely would weaken demand for our wood pellet products. Our wood pellet projects also will compete with other forms of renewable energy, many of which are developing and could attain greater market acceptance than electricity generated from wood pellets. Any failure of our wood pellet businesses to successfully compete with other forms of energy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe demand for industrial wood pellets is dependent, in significant part, on government regulations over which we have no control.\nThe demand for industrial wood pellets for energy production is driven, in significant part, by governmental policies and incentives. For example, the European Union, or EU, has adopted legislation that includes certain climate and energy targets for the EU known as the \u201c20-20-20 target.\u201d This legislation aims to achieve the following targets by 2020: (i) a 20% reduction in EU greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels; (ii) an increase in the share of EU energy consumption produced from renewable resources to 20%; and (iii) a 20% improvement in the EU\u2019s energy efficiency. The European Commission also has adopted the Communication \u201cEnergy Roadmap 2050\u201d renewing its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 80 to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050. As part of the Energy Roadmap 2050, the European Commission released the 2030 policy framework for climate and energy, which targets to reduce EU domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below the 1990 level by 2030 and to increase the share of renewable energy consumption to at least 27% by 2030. The UK has been an early adopter of these policies. The UK has adopted legislation targeting a reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% of 1990 levels by 2050. Through the launch of the Renewable Heat Incentive, the UK has also introduced a new payment system for the generation of heat from renewable sources. Moreover, the \u201cRenewables Obligation\u201d imposed by the UK in 2002 requires all electricity suppliers licensed in the UK to source a specified and annually increasing proportion of electricity from eligible renewable resources, or such suppliers will face a penalty. Under current law, the Renewables Obligation will remain in place through 2037. Some electricity suppliers are transitioning from more traditional fuel such as coal, which cost less than wood pellets, to using wood pellets as a feedstock to comply with this legislation and to receive the related incentives. These transitions would not occur in the absence of such legislation and related incentives. In the event that any of these or other similar governmental policies and incentives are modified or withdrawn, the demand for wood pellets would likely decrease significantly. Any such change in government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur wood fibre processing business is subject to environmental laws and regulations. We expect that the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will increase over time, and we could become subject to material environmental liabilities.\nOur wood fibre processing business is subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety regulations governing the emission and release of hazardous substances into the environment and the treatment and discharge of waste water and the storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous substances. These laws may include, in the United States, the CAA, the Clean Water Act, RCRA, CERCLA, TSCA, and various other federal, state and local laws and regulations, and other laws in Canada and other jurisdictions. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in substantial penalties, injunctive orders compelling installation of additional controls, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations or facility shutdowns. In addition, new environmental laws and regulations, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, increased governmental enforcement of laws and regulations or other developments could require us to make additional expenditures. These expenditures or costs for environmental compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations require permits and authorizations. Failure to comply with these permits or environmental laws generally could result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions, court orders to install pollution-control equipment, permit revocations and facility shutdowns. We may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue.\nOur business, and the real property on which it is operated, also is subject to spills, discharges or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment. We could be held liable for past or future releases at or migrating beneath the real property where we have operated, or the real property currently or formerly owned or leased by us, even if we did not cause the release or own, operate or lease the real property when the release occurred. Past or future spills related to our facilities or transportation of products or hazardous substances from our facilities may give rise to liability (including strict liability, or liability without fault, and potential clean-up responsibility) to governmental entities or private parties under federal, state or local environmental laws, as well as under common law. For example, we could be held strictly liable under CERCLA, for past or future spills without regard to fault or whether our actions were in\ncompliance with the law at the time of the spills. Pursuant to CERCLA and similar state statutes, we could be held liable for contamination associated with our facilities, facilities we formerly owned or operated (if any) and facilities to which we transported or arranged for the transportation of wastes or by-products containing hazardous substances for treatment, storage or disposal. The potential penalties and clean-up costs for past or future releases or spills, liability to third parties for damage to their property or exposure to hazardous substances, or the need to address newly discovered information or conditions that may require response actions could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations outside the United States may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions.\nOur operations in non-United States jurisdictions are subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the United States, and these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under United States law. Moreover, enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-United States jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if United States law governed these operations.\nOur wood fibre processing and sales operations in Chile and Uruguay face additional risks.\nFulghum has four wood processing mills in Chile and one in Uruguay. We also sell wood chips and biomass fuel in Chile. Our operations in Chile and Uruguay expose us to the following risks:\n\u2022\nWe purchase wood to support the export of chips from Chile. As a result, this business is subject to risks related to the supply and cost of wood. See \u201cPart II - Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk - Commodity Price Risk\u201d included in this report.\n\u2022\nBecause they are located in locations more distant to us than our operations in the United States, we may have greater difficulty overseeing manufacturing operations at our wood processing mills in Chile and Uruguay.\n\u2022\nIf an adverse change in local, political, economic, social or labor conditions, or tax or other laws, occurs in Chile or Uruguay, our operations in those countries could be adversely impacted.\n\u2022\nWe may have greater difficulty hiring personnel needed to oversee our operations in Chile and Uruguay.\n\u2022\nOur operations in Chile and Uruguay could expose us to risks relating to longer payment cycles, increased credit risk, higher levels of payment fraud or unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\u2022\nOur operations in Chile and Uruguay could expose us to risks relating to foreign laws and legal systems, some of which are still developing.\n\u2022\nOur operations in Chile and Uruguay could expose us to risks relating to different employee/employer relationships, existence of workers\u2019 councils and labor unions and other challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences.\nIf any of these risks materialize or worsen, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWeather conditions could adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of our wood pellet business. In addition, NEWP\u2019s business is seasonal, and events occurring during seasons in which revenues for this business are typically higher may disproportionately affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse weather conditions could negatively impact sales of NEWP\u2019s wood pellets and the processing of our industrial, residential and commercial wood pellets. Weather conditions generally have an impact on the demand for wood pellets. Because NEWP supplies distributors whose customers depend on heating fuel during the winter, warmer-than-normal temperatures during the first and fourth calendar quarters in one or more regions in which NEWP operates can decrease the total volume we sell and the gross margin realized on those sales. Warmer temperatures in the Northeast could have a particularly adverse impact on sales, since almost all of NEWP\u2019s wood pellets are consumed in that region. A reduction in the total volume we sell or in the gross margin we realize on such sales would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. To accommodate the seasonality in sales, NEWP typically builds inventory during the months of March through August, which increases its working capital requirements during those months of the year. As a result of the seasonality in its business, NEWP\u2019s revenues, results of operations and net working capital will vary from quarter to quarter.\nIn addition, colder weather during the winter months could adversely impact our ability to process and pelletize wood for our industrial and residential wood pellet facilities. Weather and weather changes have an impact on our production efficiencies. Colder weather during winter months may adversely impact the processing of wood (particle sizing and drying) prior to pelletizing. Significant moisture from rain and snow may also adversely impact the drying of wood and increase the costs of drying wood fuel. Production process changes such as moisture content, particle sizing, and pelletizing die size may be needed when weather climate conditions change, all of which may adversely affect the processing and pelletizing of wood. A decrease in production efficiencies would increase our production costs. A reduction in the gross margin we realize on such sales would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to integrate NEWP and Allegheny Pellet Corp. into our operations successfully.\nIn May 2014, we are acquired all of the outstanding equity of NEWP, and in January 2015, NEWP acquired the assets of Allegheny Pellet Corporation, which consists of a wood pellet processing facility located in Youngsville, Pennsylvania. We could face significant difficulties in integrating these businesses into our operations. These difficulties could include:\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties in the acquired operations and disruption of the ongoing operations of our business;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve financial or operating objectives with respect to these acquisitions;\n\u2022\nstrain on the operational and managerial controls and procedures of our business, and the need to modify systems or to add management resources;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration and retention of customers or personnel and the integration and effective deployment of operations or technologies;\n\u2022\nassumption of unknown material liabilities or regulatory non-compliance issues;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of financial reporting systems, which could cause a delay in the issuance of, or impact the reliability of our financial statements;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including a delay in or failure to successfully integrate these businesses into our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\namortization of acquired assets, which would reduce future reported earnings;\n\u2022\npossible adverse effects on our consolidated cash flows or operating results; and\n\u2022\nexpenditures related to the cost of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and standards.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate these businesses into our operations successfully. Any failure by us to integrate these businesses into our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are dependent upon the personnel we acquired from the Fulghum and NEWP acquisitions, the loss of whom could adversely affect our business.\nBecause efficient wood processing requires skilled employees, we depend on the services of the personnel that we acquired through the Fulghum and NEWP acquisitions. Since we have only recently acquired our wood processing business, we may not have sufficient experience or knowledge regarding the operations of this industry without these personnel. As a result, we may be dependent upon the expertise of these personnel to operate the assets or business successfully. If these personnel quit, retire or otherwise cease to be employed by us and we are unable to locate or hire qualified replacements, or if the cost to locate and hire qualified replacements for these employees increases materially, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nDue to our dependence on significant customers in our residential and commercial wood pellet business, the loss of one or more of such significant customers could adversely affect our results of operations.\nNEWP depends on significant customers, and the loss of one or several of such significant customers may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. In the aggregate, NEWP\u2019s top two big-box retailers, Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s Home Improvement, represented about 40% of NEWP\u2019s total sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. As is typical in the wood pellet industry, NEWP\u2019s sales to big-box retailers are primarily made on a purchase order basis, and NEWP generally does not have long-term orders or commitments from our big-box retailers. As a result, we are limited in our ability to predict the level of future sales or commitments from our current customers. If our sales to any of our significant customers were to decline, we may not be able to find other customers to purchase the excess supply of NEWP\u2019s products. The loss of one or several of our significant customers of our wood pellet products, or a significant reduction in purchase volume by any of them, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Nitrogen Fertilizer Business\nOur nitrogen fertilizer operations may become unprofitable and may require substantial working capital financing.\nIn recent years, our nitrogen fertilizer business has generated positive income from operations and positive cash flow from operations. However, in the past, we sustained losses and negative cash flow from operations. Our profits and cash flow are subject to changes in the prices for our products and our main inputs, natural gas, ammonia and sulfur, which are commodities, and, as such, the prices can be volatile in response to numerous factors outside of our control. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2014, the market prices for ammonia and sulfur increased at a faster rate than the increase in prices for our ammonium sulfate and sulfur acid products. As a result, our Pasadena Facility had to write-down $6.0 million of ammonium sulfate inventory to market value, which contributed to a gross loss at the Pasadena Facility for the year. Further, our profits depend on maintaining high rates of production of our products, and interruptions in operations at the Fertilizer Facilities, could materially adversely affect our profitability. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we experienced disruptions at both of our Fertilizer Facilities. The Pasadena Facility underwent a turnaround in December 2013, which lasted longer than anticipated due to issues with a contractor and weather delays, and experienced several relatively small disruptions in production that, in the aggregate, negatively impacted production in 2013. The East Dubuque Facility also experienced a turnaround and a fire, which halted the production of all products in late November and for most of December 2013. These events significantly contributed to a substantial decrease in sales volume in ammonia and UAN sales between the years ended 31, 2013 and 2012. If we are not able to operate the Fertilizer Facilities at a profit or if we are not able to retain cash or access a sufficient amount of financing for working capital for our nitrogen fertilizer operations, our business, financial condition, cash flow and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nThe nitrogen fertilizer business and nitrogen fertilizer prices are seasonal, cyclical and highly volatile and have experienced substantial and sudden downturns in the past. Currently, nitrogen fertilizer demand is at a relative high point and could decrease significantly in the future. Cycles in demand and pricing could potentially expose us to significant fluctuations in our operating and financial results and expose you to material reductions in the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in nitrogen fertilizer demand and prices in the agricultural industry. These fluctuations historically have had, and could in the future have, significant effects on prices across all nitrogen fertilizer products and, in turn, our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations, which could result in significant volatility or material reductions in the price of our common stock.\nNitrogen fertilizer products are commodities, the prices of which can be highly volatile. The price of nitrogen fertilizer products depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions, cyclical trends in end-user markets, supply and demand imbalances, the prices of natural gas, ammonia, sulfur and other raw materials, the prices of other commodities such as corn, soybeans, potatoes, cotton, canola, alfalfa and wheat, and weather conditions, all of which have a greater relevance because of the seasonal nature of fertilizer application. If seasonal demand exceeds the projections on which we base production, our customers may acquire nitrogen fertilizer products from our competitors, and our profitability will be negatively impacted. If seasonal demand is less than we expect, we will be left with excess inventory for which we have limited storage capacity and that will have to be stored or liquidated, which could adversely affect our operating margins.\nDemand for nitrogen fertilizer products is dependent on demand for crop nutrients by the global agricultural industry. In recent years, nitrogen fertilizer products have been in high demand, driven by a growing world population, changes in dietary habits and an expanded production of corn. Supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates of nitrogen producers, raw material costs, government policies and global trade. Our results of operations in any year could be negatively impacted by these factors. For example, RNP\u2019s results for the year ended December 31, 2014 were heavily affected by significant unanticipated declines in nitrogen prices. During the year ended December 31, 2014, fertilizer prices fell due to weather factors, reduced expectations for corn acreage in\n2015 and increased volumes of urea exported from China. A significant or prolonged decrease in nitrogen fertilizer prices would have a material adverse effect on our business and cash flow. Further, the margins on the sale of ammonium sulfate fertilizer products are currently lower than the margins on our other main nitrogen fertilizer products. If our costs to produce ammonium sulfate fertilizer products increase and the prices at which RNPLLC sells these products do not correspondingly increase, our profits from the sale of these products may decrease or we may suffer losses on these sales. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2014, our Pasadena Facility suffered a gross loss due to lower ammonium sulfate sales prices, a write-down of inventory and other factors. A significant or prolonged decrease in profits (or increase in losses) on the sale of our ammonium sulfate fertilizer products would have a material adverse effect on our business and cash flow.\nAny decline in United States agricultural production or crop prices or limitations on the use of nitrogen fertilizer for agricultural purposes could have a material adverse effect on the market for nitrogen fertilizer, and on our results of operations and financial condition.\nConditions in the United States agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results. This is particularly the case in the production of corn, which is a major driver of the demand for nitrogen fertilizer products in the United States. The United States agricultural industry in general, and the production and prices of corn in particular, can be affected by a number of factors, including weather patterns and soil conditions, current and projected grain inventories and prices, domestic and international supply of and demand for United States agricultural products and United States and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products. Prices for these agricultural products can decrease suddenly and significantly.\nState and federal governmental regulations and policies, including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs, as well as the prices of fertilizer products, may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted, the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications. Developments in crop technology, such as nitrogen fixation, the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate, could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for nitrogen fertilizer. In addition, from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment. The adoption or enforcement of such regulations could adversely affect the demand for and prices of nitrogen fertilizers, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nA major factor underlying the current high level of demand for our nitrogen-based fertilizer products is the expanding production of ethanol. A decrease in ethanol production, an increase in ethanol imports or a shift away from corn as a principal raw material used to produce ethanol could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA major factor underlying the current level of demand for corn and the use of nitrogen fertilizer products is the current production level of ethanol in the United States. Ethanol production in the United States is dependent in part upon a myriad of federal and state incentives. Such incentive programs may not be renewed, or if renewed, they may be renewed on terms significantly less favorable to ethanol producers than current incentive programs. Studies showing that expanded ethanol production may increase the level of GHGs in the environment, or other factors, may reduce political support for ethanol production. The EPA has proposed reducing 2014 renewable blending mandates, which could reduce the level of corn-based ethanol to be blended into the nation\u2019s gasoline supply. If the target for use of renewable fuels such as ethanol is reduced, the demand for corn may fall significantly. Moreover, the current trend in ethanol production research is to develop an efficient method of producing ethanol from cellulose-based biomass. If another ethanol-related subsidy is not implemented, or if an efficient method of producing ethanol from cellulose-based biomass is developed and commercially deployed at scale, the demand for corn may decrease significantly. Any reduction in the demand for corn and, in turn, for nitrogen fertilizer products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face intense competition from other nitrogen fertilizer producers.\nWe have a number of competitors in the nitrogen fertilizer business in the United States and in other countries, including state-owned and government-subsidized entities. Our East Dubuque Facility\u2019s principal competitors include domestic and foreign fertilizer producers, major grain companies and independent distributors and brokers, including Koch, CF Industries, Agrium, Gavilon, LLC, CHS Inc., Transammonia, Inc., OCI and Helm Fertilizer Corp. Our Pasadena Facility\u2019s principal competitors include domestic and foreign fertilizer producers and independent distributors and brokers, including BASF AG, Honeywell, Agrium, Royal DSM N.V., Dakota Gasification Company and Martin Midstream Partners L.P. and producers of nitrogen fertilizer in China.\nSome competitors have greater total resources, or better name recognition, and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales, which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities. For example, certain of our East Dubuque Facility\u2019s nitrogen fertilizer competitors have recently expanded production capacity for their nitrogen fertilizer products. Furthermore, a few dormant nitrogen production facilities located outside of the East Dubuque Facility\u2019s core market have recently resumed operations. The additional capacity has placed downward pressure on average sales prices for ammonia and UAN. Moreover, we may face additional competition due to further expansion of facilities that are currently operating and the reopening of currently dormant facilities. Also, other producers of nitrogen fertilizer products are contemplating the construction of new nitrogen fertilizer facilities in North America, including in the Mid Corn Belt. For example, OCI has announced that it is constructing a facility located 165 miles away from our East Dubuque Facility that is designed to produce between 1.5 to 2.0 million metric tons per year of ammonia, urea, UAN and diesel exhaust fluid. The facility is expected to begin production in late 2015. If a new nitrogen fertilizer facility is completed in the East Dubuque Facility\u2019s core market, it could benefit from the same competitive advantage associated with the location of the facility. As a result, the completion of such a facility could have a material adverse effect on our business and cash flow.\nMany of our competitors in the nitrogen fertilizer business incur greater costs than we and our customers do in transporting their products over longer distances via rail, ships, barges and pipelines. There can be no assurance that our competitors\u2019 transportation costs will not decline or that additional pipelines will not be built in the future, lowering the price at which our competitors can sell their products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur competitive position could also suffer to the extent that we are not able to adapt our nitrogen fertilizer product mix to meet the needs of our customers or expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through joint ventures or partnerships. An inability to compete successfully in the nitrogen fertilizer business could result in the loss of customers, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability. In addition, as a result of increased pricing pressures in the nitrogen fertilizer business caused by competition, we may in the future experience reductions in our profit margins on sales, or may be unable to pass future input price increases on to our customers, which would reduce our cash flows. For example, higher exports of ammonium sulfate from China during 2014 put downward pressure on ammonium sulfate prices, and prices for ammonia and sulfur, key inputs for ammonium sulfate, increased significantly. The factors together negatively impacted product margins for ammonium sulfate.\nOur nitrogen fertilizer business is seasonal, which may result in our carrying significant amounts of inventory and seasonal variations in working capital. Our inability to predict future seasonal nitrogen fertilizer demand accurately may result in excess inventory or product shortages.\nOur nitrogen fertilizer business is highly seasonal. Historically, most of the annual deliveries of the products from our East Dubuque Facility have occurred during the quarters ending June 30 and December 31 of each year due to the condensed nature of the spring planting season and the fall harvest in the East Dubuque Facility\u2019s market. Farmers in that market tend to apply nitrogen fertilizer during two short application periods, one in the spring and the other in the fall. Since interim period operating results reflect the seasonal nature of our nitrogen fertilizer business, they are not indicative of results expected for the full fiscal year. In addition, results for comparable quarters can vary significantly from one year to the next due primarily to weather-related shifts in planting schedules and purchase patterns of our customers. We expect to incur substantial expenditures for fixed costs throughout the year and substantial expenditures for inventory in advance of the spring planting season and fall harvest season in our East Dubuque Facility\u2019s market as we build inventories during these low demand periods. Seasonality also relates to the limited windows of opportunity that nitrogen fertilizer customers have to complete required tasks at each stage of crop cultivation. Should events such as adverse weather or production or transportation interruptions occur during these seasonal windows, we would face the possibility of reduced revenue without the opportunity to recover until the following season. In addition, an adverse weather pattern affecting one of our markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our nitrogen fertilizer products and our revenues, and we may not have sufficient geographic diversity in our customer base to mitigate such effects. Because of the seasonality of agriculture, we also expect to face the risk of significant inventory carrying costs should our customers\u2019 activities be curtailed during their normal seasons. The seasonality can negatively impact accounts receivable collections and increase bad debts. In addition, variations in the proportion of product sold through forward sales and variances in the terms and timing of prepaid contracts can affect working capital requirements and increase the seasonal and year-to-year volatility of our cash flow.\nIf seasonal demand for nitrogen fertilizer exceeds our projections, we will not have enough product and our customers may acquire products from our competitors. If seasonal demand is less than we expect, we will be left with excess inventory and higher working capital and liquidity requirements. The degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors.\nThe market for natural gas has been volatile. Natural gas prices are currently at a relative low point. An increase in natural gas prices could impact our relative competitive position when compared to other foreign and domestic nitrogen fertilizer producers, and if prices for natural gas increase significantly, we may not be able to economically operate our East Dubuque Facility.\nThe operation of our East Dubuque Facility with natural gas as the primary feedstock exposes us to market risk due to increases in natural gas prices, particularly if the price of natural gas in the United States were to become higher than the price of natural gas outside the United States. An increase in natural gas prices would impact our East Dubuque Facility\u2019s operations by making us less competitive with competitors who do not use natural gas as their primary feedstock, and would therefore have a material adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if natural gas prices in the United States were to increase relative to prices of natural gas paid by foreign nitrogen fertilizer producers, this may negatively affect our competitive position in the Mid Corn Belt region and thus have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe profitability of operating our East Dubuque Facility is significantly dependent on the cost of natural gas, and our East Dubuque Facility has operated in the past, and may operate in the future, at a net loss. Local factors may affect the price of natural gas available to us, in addition to factors that determine the benchmark prices of natural gas. Since we expect to purchase a substantial portion of our natural gas for use in our East Dubuque Facility on the spot market, we remain susceptible to fluctuations in the price of natural gas in general and in local markets in particular. We also expect to use short-term, fixed supply, fixed price forward purchase contracts to lock in pricing for a portion of our natural gas requirements. Our ability to enter into forward purchase contracts is dependent upon our creditworthiness and, in the event of a deterioration in our credit, counterparties could refuse to enter into forward purchase contracts on acceptable terms. If we are unable to enter into forward purchase contracts for the supply of natural gas, we would need to purchase natural gas on the spot market, which would impair our ability to hedge our exposure to risk from fluctuations in natural gas prices. If we fix the price of natural gas with forward purchase contracts, and natural gas prices decrease, then our cost of sales could be higher than it would have been in the absence of the forward purchase contracts. However, forward purchase contracts may not protect us from all of the increases in natural gas prices. A hypothetical increase of $0.10 per MMBtu of natural gas would increase our cost to produce one ton of ammonia by $3.30. Higher than anticipated costs for the catalyst and other materials used at our East Dubuque Facility could also adversely affect operating results. These increased costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny interruption in the supply of natural gas to our East Dubuque Facility through Nicor could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur East Dubuque operations depend on the availability of natural gas. We have an agreement with Nicor pursuant to which we access natural gas from the ANR and Northern Natural Gas pipelines. Our access to satisfactory supplies of natural gas through Nicor could be disrupted due to a number of causes, including volume limitations under the agreement, pipeline malfunctions, service interruptions, mechanical failures or other reasons. The agreement extends for five consecutive periods of 12 months each, with the first period having commenced on November 1, 2010 and the last period ending October 31, 2015. For each period, Nicor may establish a bidding period during which we may match the best bid received by Nicor for the natural gas capacity provided under the agreement. We could be out-bid for any of the remaining periods under the agreement. In addition, upon expiration of the last period, we may be unable to renew the agreement on satisfactory terms, or at all. Any disruption in the supply of natural gas to our East Dubuque Facility could restrict our ability to continue to make products at the facility. In the event we needed to obtain natural gas from another source, we would need to build a new connection from that source to our East Dubuque Facility and negotiate related easement rights, which would be costly, disruptive and/or unfeasible. As a result, any interruption in the supply of natural gas through Nicor could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe markets for ammonia and sulfur have been volatile. If prices for either ammonia or sulfur increase or decrease significantly, we may not be able to economically operate our Pasadena Facility.\nThe operation of our Pasadena Facility with ammonia and sulfur as its primary feedstocks also exposes us to market risk due to increases in ammonia or sulfur prices. Since we expect to purchase a substantial portion of our ammonia and sulfur for use in our Pasadena Facility on the spot market we remain susceptible to fluctuations in the respective prices of ammonia and sulfur. The margins on the sale of ammonium sulfate fertilizer products are relatively low. If our costs to produce ammonium sulfate fertilizer products increase and the prices at which we sell these products do not correspondingly increase, our profits from the sale of these products may decrease or we may suffer losses on these sales. A hypothetical increase of $10.00 per ton of ammonia would increase the cost to produce one ton of ammonium sulfate by $2.50. A hypothetical increase of $10.00 per ton of sulfur would also increase the cost to produce one ton of ammonium sulfate by $2.50. We do not believe that there is any significant opportunity to reduce the costs of these inputs through hedging.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the prices paid by our Pasadena Facility for ammonia and sulfur increased substantially, which increased our costs of inputs, but the prices of our products did not rise at the same rate. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we had significant amounts of inventory at costs representing input costs higher than the current market price for our products, and we incurred an approximate $6.0 million write-down of ammonium sulfate inventory. Market prices for ammonia and sulfur products may continue to remain low, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe success of our ammonium sulfate fertilizer business depends on our ability to improve product sales and margins and to reduce cost at the Pasadena Facility.\nOur ammonium sulfate fertilizer business has a limited operating history upon which its business and products can be evaluated. The Pasadena Facility produced phosphate fertilizer until early 2011 when it underwent a conversion to produce ammonium sulfate fertilizer products. In late 2014, we restructured operations at our Pasadena Facility, including to reduce expected annual production of ammonium sulfate by approximately 25 percent, to 500,000 tons. Because our ammonium sulfate fertilizer business has a limited operating history, we may not be able to effectively:\n\u2022\nmaintain product quality, product sales prices, margins and operating costs at levels that we currently expect;\n\u2022\nachieve production rates and on-stream factor that we currently expect;\n\u2022\nimplement potential capital improvements to lower costs and increase revenues at the Pasadena Facility;\n\u2022\nattract and retain customers for our products from our existing production capacity;\n\u2022\ncomply with evolving regulatory requirements, including environmental regulations;\n\u2022\nanticipate and adapt to changes in the ammonium sulfate fertilizer market;\n\u2022\nmaintain and develop strategic relationships with distributors and suppliers to facilitate the distribution and acquire necessary materials for our products; and\n\u2022\nattract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nThe operations at the Pasadena Facility are subject to many of the risks inherent in the growth of a new business. The likelihood of the facility\u2019s success must be evaluated in light of the challenges, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in the operation of a new business. Moreover, the sales prices for ammonium sulfate have significantly worsened and remain low. We cannot assure you that we will achieve the goals set forth above or any goals we may set in the future. Our failure to meet any of these goals could have a material adverse effect on our business and cash flow.\nWe have recorded goodwill impairment charges and recorded write-downs of finished goods and raw material inventories with respect to our Pasadena Facility, and we could be required to record additional material impairment charges and write-downs in the future.\nDuring 2014, we lowered our profitability expectations for the Pasadena Facility primarily due to lower projected market prices for ammonium sulfate. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $27.2 million relating to the Agrifos Acquisition, and we incurred an approximate $6.0 million write-down of ammonium sulfate inventory. The future profitability of our Pasadena Facility will be significantly affected by, among other things, nitrogen fertilizer product prices and the prices of the inputs to its production processes. It is possible that adverse changes to supply and demand factors relating to the Pasadena Facility\u2019s nitrogen fertilizer products could require us to lower further our expectations for the profitability of the facility in the future. If this were to occur, we could be required to record additional material impairment charges, including with respect to impairment of long-lived assets, and additional write-downs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, the trading price of our common stock and our reputation.\nThere are phosphogypsum stacks located at the Pasadena Facility that will require closure. In the event we become financially obligated for the costs of closure, this would have a material adverse effect on our business and cash flow.\nThe Pasadena Facility was used for phosphoric acid production until 2011, which resulted in the creation of a number of phosphogypsum stacks at the Pasadena Facility. Phosphogypsum stacks are composed of the mineral processing waste that is the byproduct of the extraction of phosphorous from mineral ores. Certain of the stacks also have been or are used for other waste materials and wastewater. Applicable environmental laws extensively regulate phosphogypsum stacks.\nThe EPA reached a CAFO with ExxonMobil in September 2010 making ExxonMobil responsible for closure of the stacks, proper disposal of process wastewater related to the stacks and other expenses. In addition, the asset purchase agreement between a subsidiary of Agrifos and ExxonMobil, or the 1998 APA, pursuant to which the subsidiary purchased the Pasadena Facility in 1998 also makes ExxonMobil liable for closure and post-closure care of the stacks, with certain limitations relating to use of the stacks after the date of the agreement. ExxonMobil is in the process of closing the \u201csouth stack\u201d (a large phosphogypsum stack that combines \u201cstacks 2, 3 and 5\u201d) and \u201cstack 4\u201d at the facility. ExxonMobil has not yet started closure of \u201cstack 1\u201d at the facility, which is the only remaining stack that is currently in use for disposal of waste streams. Although ExxonMobil has expended significant funds and\nresources relating to the closures, we cannot assure you that ExxonMobil will remain able and willing to complete closure and post-closure care of the stacks in the future, including as a result of actions taken by Agrifos prior to the closing of the Agrifos Acquisition. As of January 2012, ExxonMobil estimated that its total outstanding costs associated with the closures and long-term maintenance, monitoring and care of the stacks will be $102 million over the next 50 years. However, the actual amount of such costs could be in excess of this amount.\nAs discussed above, the costs of closure and post-closure care of the stacks will be substantial. If we become financially responsible for the costs of closure of the stacks, this would have a material adverse effect on our business and cash flow.\nSoil and groundwater at the Pasadena Facility is pervasively contaminated, and we may incur costs to investigate and remediate known or suspected contamination at the Pasadena Facility. We may also face legal actions or sanctions or incur costs related to contamination or noncompliance with environmental laws at the facility.\nThe soil and groundwater at the Pasadena Facility is pervasively contaminated. The facility has produced fertilizer since as early as the 1940s, and a large number of spills and releases have occurred at the facility, many of which involved hazardous substances. Furthermore, naturally occurring and other radioactive contaminants have been discovered at the facility in the past, and asbestos-containing materials currently exist at the facility. In the past there have been numerous instances of weather events which have resulted in flooding and releases of hazardous substances from the facility. We cannot assure you that past environmental investigations at the facility were complete, and there may be other contaminants at the facility that have not been detected. Contamination at the Pasadena Facility has the potential to result in toxic tort, property damage, personal injury and natural resources damages claims or other lawsuits. Further, regulators may require investigation and remediation at the facility in the future at significant expense.\nExxonMobil submitted Affected Property Assessment Reports, or APARs, under the Texas Risk Reduction Program to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, or the TCEQ, beginning in 2011 for the plant site and phosphogypsum stacks at the Pasadena Facility. The APARs identify instances in which various regulatory limits for numerous hazardous materials in both the soil and groundwater at the plant site and in the vicinity of the stacks have been exceeded. TCEQ is requiring ExxonMobil to perform significant additional investigative work as part of the APAR process. The TCEQ may also require further remediation of the contamination at the Pasadena Facility. The TCEQ or other regulatory agencies may hold Agrifos or its subsidiaries responsible for certain of the contamination at the Pasadena Facility.\nIn the past, governmental authorities have alleged or determined that the Pasadena Facility has been in substantial noncompliance with environmental laws and the Pasadena Facility has been the subject of numerous regulatory enforcement actions. The facility has also been subject to a number of past or current governmental enforcement actions, consent agreements, orders, and lawsuits, including, as examples, actions concerning the closure of the phosphogypsum stacks at the facility, the release of process water and wastewater, hydrogen fluoride emissions, emissions of oxides of sulfur, releases of ammonia and other hazardous substances, various alleged Clean Water Act violations, the potential for off-site contamination, and other matters. In the future, we may be required to expend significant funds to attain or maintain compliance with environmental laws. For example, the facility may not comply with wastewater and stormwater discharge requirements and solid and hazardous waste requirements. Following closure of phosphogypsum stack 1 at the facility, we may need to upgrade the facility\u2019s wastewater system and arrange for offsite disposal of wastes that are currently disposed of onsite in order to maintain compliance with environmental laws, and the costs to design, construct, and operate such a system could be material. Regulatory findings of noncompliance could trigger sanctions, including monetary penalties, require installation of control or other equipment or other modifications, adverse permit modifications, the forced curtailment or termination of operations or other adverse impacts.\nThe costs we may incur in connection with the matters described above could be material. Subject to the terms and conditions of the 1998 APA, we are entitled to indemnification from ExxonMobil for certain losses relating to environmental matters relating to the facility and arising out of conditions present prior to our acquisition of the facility. However, our rights to indemnification under this agreement is subject to important limitations, and we cannot assure you we will be able to obtain payment from ExxonMobil on a timely basis, or at all. Depending on the amount of the costs we may incur for such matters in a given period, this could have a material adverse effect on the results of our business and cash flow.\nDue to our lack of diversification, adverse developments in the nitrogen fertilizer industry or at either of our Fertilizer Facilities could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely primarily on the revenues generated from our two Fertilizer Facilities. An adverse development in the market for nitrogen fertilizer products in our regions generally or at either of our Fertilizer Facilities in particular would have a significantly greater impact on our operations than it would on other companies that are more diversified geographically or that have a more diverse asset and product base. The largest publicly traded companies with which we compete in the nitrogen fertilizer business sell a more diverse range of fertilizer products to broader markets.\nOur Fertilizer Facilities face operating hazards and interruptions, including unplanned maintenance or shutdowns. We could face potentially significant costs to the extent these hazards or interruptions cause a material decline in production and are not fully covered by our existing insurance coverage. Insurance companies that currently insure companies in our industry may cease to do so, may change the coverage provided or may substantially increase premiums in the future.\nOur nitrogen fertilizer operations are subject to significant operating hazards and interruptions. Any significant curtailing of production at one of the Fertilizer Facilities or individual units within one of the Fertilizer Facilities could result in materially lower levels of revenues and cash flow for the duration of any shutdown. Operations at the Fertilizer Facilities could be curtailed or partially or completely shut down, temporarily or permanently, as the result of a number of circumstances, most of which are not within our control, such as:\n\u2022\nunplanned maintenance or catastrophic events such as a major accident or fire, damage by severe weather, flooding or other natural disaster:\n\u2022\nlabor difficulties that result in a work stoppage or slowdown;\n\u2022\nenvironmental proceedings or other litigation that compel the cessation of all or a portion of the operations at one of our Fertilizer Facilities;\n\u2022\nincreasingly stringent environmental and emission regulations;\n\u2022\na disruption in the supply of natural gas to our East Dubuque Facility or ammonia or sulfur to our Pasadena Facility; and\n\u2022\na governmental ban or other limitation on the use of nitrogen fertilizer products, either generally or specifically those manufactured at our Fertilizer Facilities.\nThe magnitude of the effect on us of any unplanned shutdown will depend on the length of the shutdown and the extent of the operations affected by the shutdown.\nOur East Dubuque Facility has been in operation since 1965. Our Pasadena Facility has been in operation producing various products since the 1940s. In 2011, the Pasadena Facility was converted to the production of high-quality granulated synthetic ammonium sulfate, and began selling ammonium sulfate and ammonium thiosulfate as its primary products. Historically, our East Dubuque Facility and Pasadena Facility have required a planned maintenance turnaround every two years. Starting with our planned maintenance turnaround in 2016, our East Dubuque Facility will have a planned maintenance turnaround every three years. Turnarounds at our East Dubuque Facility generally last between 18 and 25 days, and turnarounds at our Pasadena Facility generally last between 14 and 25 days. We intend to alternate the year in which a turnaround occurs at each facility, so that both facilities do not experience a turnaround in the same year. Upon completion of a facility turnaround, we may face delays and difficulties restarting production at the Fertilizer Facilities. During the fourth quarter of 2013, our East Dubuque Facility halted production due to a turnaround and a fire. Our Pasadena Facility also underwent a turnaround in December of 2013 which lasted longer than anticipated due to issues with a contractor and weather delays. The duration of our turnarounds or other shutdowns, and the impact they have on our operations, have in the past and could in the future materially adversely affect our cash flow in the quarter or quarters in which such turnarounds or shutdowns occur.\nA major accident, fire, explosion, flood, severe weather event, terrorist attack or other event also could damage the Fertilizer Facilities or the environment and the surrounding communities or result in injuries or loss of life. Scheduled and unplanned maintenance could reduce our cash flow for the period of time that any portion of the Fertilizer Facilities are not operating.\nIf we experience significant property damage, business interruption, environmental claims, fines, penalties or other liabilities, our business could be materially adversely affected to the extent the damages or claims exceed the amount of valid and collectible insurance available to us. We are currently insured under our casualty, environmental, property and business interruption insurance policies. The policies are subject to limits, deductibles, and waiting periods and also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder, as well as customary sub-limits for particular types of losses. For example, the current property policies contain specific sub-limits for losses resulting from business interruptions and for damage caused by covered flooding or named windstorms and resulting flooding or storm surge. We are fully exposed to all losses in excess of the applicable limits and sub-limits and for certain losses due to business interruptions.\nUnder the insurance policies that cover our Pasadena Facility, property exposures are subject to limits, deductibles and waiting periods with respect to insured physical damage and time element occurrences. Catastrophic perils such as named windstorms, floods and storm surges are subject to additional limitations that apply to each occurrence. The policies also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder, as well as customary sub- limits for particular types of losses. For example, the current property policy contains specific sub-limits for losses resulting from business interruption.\nMarket factors, including but not limited to catastrophic perils that impact the nitrogen fertilizer industry, significant changes in the investment returns of insurance companies, insurance company solvency trends and industry loss ratios and loss trends, can negatively impact the future cost and availability of insurance. There can be no assurance that we will be able to buy and maintain insurance with adequate limits, reasonable pricing terms and conditions or collect from insurance claims that we make.\nOur results of operations of our nitrogen fertilizer business are highly dependent upon and fluctuate based upon business and economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry. These factors are outside of our control and may significantly affect our profitability.\nOur results of operations of our nitrogen fertilizer business are highly dependent upon business and economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, which we cannot control. The agricultural products business can be affected by a number of factors. The most important of these factors, for United States markets, are:\n\u2022\nweather patterns and field conditions (particularly during periods of traditionally high nitrogen fertilizer consumption);\n\u2022\nquantities of nitrogen fertilizers imported to and exported from North America;\n\u2022\ncurrent and projected grain inventories and prices, which are heavily influenced by United States exports and world-wide grain markets; and\n\u2022\nUnited States governmental policies, including farm and biofuel policies, which may directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted, the level of grain inventories, the mix of crops planted or crop prices.\nInternational market conditions, which are also outside of our control, may also significantly influence our operating results. The international market for nitrogen fertilizers is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the United States dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing nitrogen fertilizers, foreign agricultural policies, the existence of, or changes in, import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets, changes in the hard currency demands of certain countries and other regulatory policies of foreign governments, as well as the laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade and investment.\nAmmonia can be very volatile and extremely hazardous. Any liability for accidents involving ammonia that cause severe damage to property or injury to the environment and human health could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the costs of transporting ammonia could increase significantly in the future.\nWe produce, process, store, handle, distribute and transport ammonia, which can be very volatile and extremely hazardous. Major accidents or releases involving ammonia could cause severe damage or injury to property, the environment and human health, as well as a possible disruption of supplies and markets. Such an event could result in civil lawsuits, fines, penalties and regulatory enforcement proceedings, all of which could lead to significant liabilities. Any damage to persons, equipment or property or other disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in operating revenues and significant additional cost to replace or repair and insure our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We periodically experience releases of ammonia related to leaks from our equipment or error in operation and use of equipment at our Fertilizer Facilities. Similar events may occur in the future.\nThese circumstances may result in sudden, severe damage or injury to property, the environment and human health. In the event of pollution, we may be held responsible even if we are not at fault and even if we complied with the laws and regulations in effect at the time of the accident. Litigation arising from accidents involving ammonia may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for large amounts of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Given the risks inherent in transporting ammonia, the costs of transporting ammonia could increase significantly in the future.\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties related to transportation and equipment that are beyond our control and that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough our customers and distributors generally pick up our nitrogen fertilizer products at our Fertilizer Facilities, we occasionally rely on barge and railroad companies to ship products to our customers and distributors. The availability of these transportation services and related equipment is subject to various hazards, including extreme weather conditions, work stoppages, delays, spills, derailments and other accidents and other operating hazards. For example, barge transport can be impacted by lock closures resulting from inclement weather or surface conditions, including fog, rain, snow, wind, ice, strong currents, floods, droughts and other unplanned natural phenomena, lock malfunction, tow conditions and other conditions. Further, the limited number of towing companies and of barges available for ammonia transport may also impact the availability of transportation for our products. These\ntransportation services and equipment are also subject to environmental, safety and other regulatory oversight. Due to concerns related to terrorism or accidents, local, state and federal governments could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of our products. In addition, new regulations could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship products from our Fertilizer Facilities. Any delay in our ability to ship our nitrogen fertilizer products as a result of transportation companies\u2019 failure to operate properly, the implementation of new and more stringent regulatory requirements affecting transportation operations or equipment, or significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur nitrogen fertilizer business is subject to extensive and frequently changing environmental laws and regulations. We expect that the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will increase over time, and we could become subject to material environmental liabilities.\nOur nitrogen fertilizer business is subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local environmental, health and safety regulations governing the emission and release of hazardous substances into the environment, the treatment and discharge of waste water and the storage, handling, use and transportation of our nitrogen fertilizer products. These laws include the CAA, the federal Clean Water Act, the RCRA, CERCLA, the TSCA, and various other federal, state and local laws and regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in substantial penalties, injunctive orders compelling installation of additional controls, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations or facility shutdowns. In addition, new environmental laws and regulations, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, increased governmental enforcement of laws and regulations or other developments could require us to make additional expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and we expect the cost of compliance with these requirements to increase over time. The ultimate impact on our business of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable due in part to the fact that our operations may change over time and certain implementing regulations for laws, such as the CAA, have not yet been finalized, are under governmental or judicial review or are being revised. These expenditures or costs for environmental compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur nitrogen fertilizer operations, as well as expansion of such operations, require numerous permits and authorizations. Failure to obtain, renew, or comply with these permits or environmental laws generally could result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions, court orders to install pollution-control equipment, permit revocations and facility shutdowns. We may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue. A decision by a government agency to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur nitrogen fertilizer business is subject to accidental spills, discharges or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Past or future spills related to our Fertilizer Facilities or transportation of products or hazardous substances from our Fertilizer Facilities may give rise to liability (including strict liability, or liability without fault, and potential cleanup responsibility) to governmental entities or private parties under federal, state or local environmental laws, as well as under common law. For example, we could be held strictly liable under CERCLA, for past or future spills without regard to fault or whether our actions were in compliance with the law at the time of the spills. Pursuant to CERCLA and similar state statutes, we could be held liable for contamination associated with our Fertilizer Facilities, facilities we formerly owned or operated (if any) and facilities to which we transported or arranged for the transportation of wastes or byproducts containing hazardous substances for treatment, storage or disposal. The potential penalties and cleanup costs for past or future releases or spills, liability to third parties for damage to their property or exposure to hazardous substances, or the need to address newly discovered information or conditions that may require response actions could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For a discussion of releases at the Pasadena Facility, see the risk factor captioned \u201cSoil and groundwater at the Pasadena Facility is pervasively contaminated, and we may incur costs to investigate and remediate known or suspected contamination at the Pasadena Facility. We may also face legal actions or sanctions or incur costs related to contamination or noncompliance with environmental laws at the facility.\u201d In addition, limited subsurface investigation indicates the presence of certain contamination at the East Dubuque facility. In the future, we may determine that there are conditions at the East Dubuque Facility that require remediation or other response.\nWe may incur future costs relating to the off-site disposal of hazardous wastes. Companies that dispose of, or arrange for the transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at off-site locations may be held jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigation and remediation of contamination at those off-site locations, regardless of fault. We could become involved in litigation or other proceedings involving off-site waste disposal and the damages or costs in any such proceedings could be material.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations on fertilizer end-use and application and numeric nutrient water quality criteria could have a material adverse impact on fertilizer demand in the future.\nFuture environmental laws and regulations on the end-use and application of fertilizers could cause changes in demand for our nitrogen fertilizer products. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, could limit our ability to market and sell such products to end users. From time to time, various state legislatures have proposed bans or other limitations on fertilizer products. In addition, a number of states have adopted or proposed numeric nutrient water quality criteria that could result in decreased demand for our fertilizer products in those states. Any such laws, regulations or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nClimate change laws, regulations, and impacts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nLegislative and regulatory measures to address GHG emissions (including CO2, methane and N2O) are in various phases of discussion or implementation. At the federal legislative level, Congress has previously considered legislation requiring a mandatory reduction of GHG emissions. Although Congressional passage of such legislation does not appear imminent at this time, it could be adopted at a future date. It is also possible that Congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency or impose a carbon fee.\nIn the absence of congressional legislation curbing GHG emissions, the EPA is moving ahead administratively under its CAA authority. In October 2009, the EPA finalized a rule requiring certain large emitters of GHGs to inventory and report their GHG emissions to the EPA. In accordance with the rule, we monitor our GHG emissions from our facilities and began reporting the emissions to the EPA annually beginning in September 2011. In December 2009, the EPA finalized its \u201cendangerment finding\u201d that GHG emissions, including CO2, pose a threat to human health and welfare. The finding allows the EPA to regulate GHG emissions as air pollutants under the CAA. The EPA adopted regulations that limit emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles, which then triggered the imposition of CAA construction and operating permit requirements under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) and Title V permitting programs for certain large stationary sources that are already subject to these requirements due to emissions of conventional, or criteria, pollutants. Facilities that are required to obtain permits for their GHG emissions are required to reduce those emissions using \u201cbest available control technology,\u201d or BACT, standards, which are currently being developed on a case-by-case basis. Future modification to one of our facilities may require us to satisfy BACT requirements and potentially require us to meet other CAA requirements applicable to GHG emissions. A number of states also have adopted reporting and mitigation requirements.\nThe implementation of additional EPA regulations and/or the passage of federal or state climate change legislation would likely increase the costs we incur to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any GHG emissions program. Increased costs associated with compliance with any future legislation or regulation of GHG emissions, if it occurs, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, climate change legislation and regulations may result in increased costs not only for our nitrogen fertilizer business but also for agricultural producers that utilize our fertilizer products, thereby potentially decreasing demand for our nitrogen fertilizer products. Decreased demand for our nitrogen fertilizer products may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nSimilarly, the impact of potential climate change on our operations and those of our customers is uncertain and could adversely affect us.\nAgrium is a distributor and customer of a significant portion of our nitrogen fertilizer products, and we have the right to store products at Agrium\u2019s terminal in Niota, Illinois. Any loss of Agrium as our distributor or customer, loss of our storage rights or decline in sales of products through or to Agrium could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe use Agrium as a distributor of a significant portion of our nitrogen fertilizer products of our East Dubuque Facility pursuant to a distribution agreement between Agrium and us. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, 78% or more of our East Dubuque Facility\u2019s total product sales were made through Agrium. Under the distribution agreement, if we are unable to reach an agreement with Agrium for the purchase and sale of our products, Agrium is under no obligation to make such purchase and sale. Agrium sells products that compete with ours, and may be incentivized to prioritize the sale of its products over ours. In the event of any decline in sales of our nitrogen fertilizer products through Agrium as distributor, we may not be able to find buyers for our products.\nThe distribution agreement has a term that ends in April 2016, but automatically renews for subsequent one-year periods (unless either party delivers a termination notice to the other party at least three months prior to an automatic renewal). The distribution agreement may be terminated prior to its stated term for specified causes. Under the distribution agreement, Agrium bears the credit risk on products sold through Agrium pursuant to the agreement. Agrium also is largely responsible for marketing our nitrogen fertilizer products to customers and the associated expense. As a result, if our distribution agreement with Agrium terminates for any reason, Agrium would no longer bear the credit risk on the sale of any of our products and we would become responsible for all of the marketing costs for such products.\nUnder the distribution agreement, we have the right to store up to 15,000 tons of ammonia at Agrium\u2019s terminal in Niota, Illinois, and we sell a portion of our ammonia at that terminal. Our right to store ammonia at the terminal expires on June 30, 2016, but automatically renews for successive one year periods, unless we deliver a termination notice to Agrium with respect to such storage rights at least three months prior to an automatic renewal. Our right to use the storage space immediately terminates if the distribution agreement terminates in accordance with its terms. Ammonia storage sites and terminals served by barge on the Mississippi River are controlled primarily by CF Industries, Koch and Agrium, each of which is one of our competitors. If we lose the right to store ammonia at the Niota, Illinois terminal, we may not be able to find suitable replacement storage on acceptable terms, or at all, and we may be forced to reduce production. We also may lose sales to customers that purchase products at the terminal.\nIn addition to distributing our products, Agrium is also a significant customer of our nitrogen fertilizer products. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, 0%, 2% and 2%, respectively, of the total product sales of our nitrogen fertilizer business were to Agrium as a direct customer (rather than a distributor) and 12%, 12% and 9%, respectively, of the total product sales of our nitrogen fertilizer business were to CPS, a controlled affiliate of Agrium. Agrium or CPS could elect to reduce or cease purchasing our nitrogen fertilizer products for a number of reasons, especially if our relationship with Agrium as a distributor were to end. If our sales to Agrium as a direct customer or CPS decline, we may not be able to find other customers to purchase the excess supply of our products.\nSales of our nitrogen fertilizer products through or to Agrium could decline or the distribution agreement or our rights to storage could terminate as a result of a number of causes which are outside of our control. Any loss of Agrium as our distributor or customer, loss of our storage rights or decline in sales of products through Agrium could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIOC is the exclusive distributor of our ammonium sulfate fertilizer. Any loss of IOC as our distributor could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have a marketing agreement that grants IOC the exclusive right and obligation to market and sell all of our Pasadena Facility\u2019s granular ammonium sulfate. The marketing agreement has a term that ends December 31, 2016, but automatically renews for subsequent one-year periods (unless either party delivers a termination notice to the other party at least 210 days prior to an automatic renewal). The marketing agreement may be terminated prior to its stated term for specified causes. If we are unable to renew our contract with IOC, we may be unable to find buyers for our granular ammonium sulfate. In addition, we have an arrangement with IOC that permits us to store approximately 60,000 tons of ammonium sulfate at IOC-controlled terminals, which are located near end customers of our Pasadena Facility\u2019s ammonium sulfate. This arrangement currently is not governed by a written contract. If we lose the right to store ammonium sulfate at these IOC-controlled terminals, we may not be able to find suitable replacement storage on acceptable terms, or at all, and we may be forced to reduce production. Any loss of IOC as our distributor, loss of our storage rights or decline in sales of products through IOC could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDue to our dependence on significant customers in our nitrogen fertilizer business, the loss of one or more of such significant customers could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur nitrogen fertilizer business depends on significant customers, and the loss of one or several of such significant customers may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In the aggregate, our top five ammonia customers represented 62%, 57% and 54%, respectively, of our ammonia sales for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, and our top five UAN customers represented 58%, 59% and 38%, respectively, of our UAN sales for the same periods. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, 0%, 2% and 2%, respectively, of the East Dubuque Facility\u2019s total product sales of our nitrogen fertilizer business were to Agrium as a direct customer (rather than a distributor) and 12%, 12% and 9%, respectively, of the East Dubuque Facility\u2019s total product sales of our nitrogen fertilizer business were to CPS, a controlled affiliate of Agrium. During the period beginning November 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014, the marketing agreement with IOC accounted for 100% of our Pasadena Facility\u2019s revenues from the sale of ammonium sulfate. Given the nature of our business, and consistent with industry practice, we generally do not have long-term minimum sales contracts with any of our customers. If our sales to any of our significant customers were to decline, we may not be able to find other customers to purchase the excess supply of our products. The loss of one or several of our significant customers of our nitrogen fertilizer products, or a significant reduction in purchase volume by any of them, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe sale of our products to customers in international markets exposes us to additional risks that could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur Pasadena Facility\u2019s products are sold through distributors to customers in North America, New Zealand, Australia, Brazil and Thailand, and our distributors could expand sales to additional international markets in the future. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, the sale of our products in international markets expose us to other risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in local political, economic, social and labor conditions, which may adversely harm our business;\n\u2022\nimport and export requirements, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, and customs classifications that may prevent our distributors from offering our products to a particular market;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, higher levels of payment fraud, and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nstill developing foreign laws and legal systems;\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding liability for products, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent;\n\u2022\ndifferent employee/employer relationships, existence of workers\u2019 councils and labor unions and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, military or political conflicts, including war and other hostilities and public health issues and outbreaks.\nIn addition, our distributors must comply with complex foreign and United States laws and regulations that apply to international sales and operations. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules, anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and antitrust and competition regulations, among others. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against our distributors, prohibitions on the conduct of their business and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure our distributors\u2019 compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our distributors will not violate our policies.\nWe are largely dependent on our customers and distributors to transport purchased goods from our Fertilizer Facilities because we do not maintain a fleet of trucks or rail cars.\nWe do not maintain a fleet of trucks and, unlike some of our major competitors, we do not maintain a fleet of rail cars. Our customers and distributors generally are located close to our Fertilizer Facilities and have been willing and able to transport purchased goods from each Fertilizer Facility. In most instances, our customers and distributors purchase products for delivery at the Fertilizer Facility and then arrange and pay to transport them to their final destinations by truck. However, in the future, the transportation needs of our customers and distributors as well as their preferences may change, and those customers and distributors may no longer be willing or able to transport purchased goods from our Fertilizer Facilities. In the event that our competitors are able to transport their products more efficiently or cost effectively than our customers and distributors, those customers and distributors may reduce or cease purchases of our products. If this were to occur, we could be forced to make a substantial investment in a fleet of trucks and/or rail cars to meet the delivery needs of customers and distributors, and this would be expensive and time consuming. We may not be able to obtain transportation capabilities on a timely basis or at all, and our inability to provide transportation for products could have a material adverse effect on our business and cash flow.\nWe are subject to strict laws and regulations regarding employee and process safety, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations related to safety, including OSHA and comparable state statutes, the purpose of which are to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, OSHA requires that we maintain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our nitrogen fertilizer operations and that we provide this information to employees, state and local governmental authorities, and local residents. Failure to comply with OSHA requirements and other related state regulations, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring and control of occupational exposure to regulated substances, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if we are subjected to significant penalties, fines or compliance costs.\nExpansion of our nitrogen fertilizer production capacity may change the balance of supply and demand in our markets, and our new products may not achieve market acceptance.\nAt our East Dubuque Facility, we increased our capacity to produce ammonia and urea and started to produce and sell DEF. Increased production of our existing nitrogen fertilizer products may reduce the selling price for those products as a result of market saturation. We may be required to sell these products at lower prices, or may not be able to sell all of the products we produce. In addition, there can be no assurance that our new products will be well-received or that we will achieve revenues or profitability levels we expect. If we cannot sell our products or are forced to reduce the prices at which we sell them, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA shortage of skilled labor, together with rising labor costs, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nEfficient production of nitrogen fertilizer using modern techniques and equipment requires skilled employees. To the extent that the services of skilled labor becomes unavailable to us for any reason, including as a result of the expiration and non-renewal of our collective bargaining agreement or the retirement of experienced employees from our aging work force, we would be required to hire other personnel. We have a collective bargaining agreement in place covering unionized employees at our East Dubuque Facility which will expire in October 2016. In addition, we have two collective bargaining agreements for our Pasadena Facility. One of these agreements expires on March 28, 2016, and the other will expire on April 30, 2016. Upon expiration, we may be unable to renew the collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or at all. We face hiring competition from our competitors, our customers and other companies operating in our industry, and we may not be able to locate or employ qualified replacements on acceptable terms or at all. If our current skilled employees quit, retire or otherwise cease to be employed by us and we are unable to locate or hire qualified replacements, or if the cost to locate and hire qualified replacements for these employees increases materially, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAny reduction in RNP\u2019s credit rating could adversely affect our fertilizer business.\nRating agencies regularly evaluate the RNP Notes, and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including RNP\u2019s financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control, including conditions affecting the fertilizer industry generally. There can be no assurance that the RNP Notes will maintain their current ratings. In September 2014, Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded the RNP Notes one notch to B-. While this action had little to no detrimental impact on our or RNP\u2019s profitability, borrowing costs, or ability to access the capital markets, future downgrades to the RNP Notes or RNP\u2019s or its credit rating could adversely affect our and RNP\u2019s profitability, borrowing costs, or ability to access the capital markets or otherwise have a negative effect on our and RNP\u2019s results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by us or RNP could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold.\nThe GE Credit Agreement, the Indenture governing the RNP Notes and the A&R GSO Credit Agreement contain significant limitations on RNP\u2019s business operations, including RNP\u2019s ability to make distributions to its common unitholders (including us).\nOn February 12, 2015, we entered into the A&R GSO Credit Agreement, comprised of a $75.0 million term loan and additional potential available borrowing capacity of up to $38.0 million, and we entered into an amendment to the Subscription Agreement, or the Subscription Agreement, with funds managed by or affiliated with GSO Capital Partners LP, or GSO Capital, or the Series E Purchasers. In July 2014, RNP entered into the GE Credit Agreement, comprised of a $50.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, or the GE Credit Facility. In April 2013, RNP entered into an indenture, or the Indenture, governing the RNP Notes.\nThe Indenture prohibits RNP from making distributions to its common unitholders (including us) if any Default (except a Reporting Default) or Event of Default (each as defined in the Indenture) exists. In addition, the Indenture contains covenants limiting RNP\u2019s ability to pay distributions to its common unitholders. The covenants apply differently depending on RNP\u2019s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Indenture). If the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is not less than 1.75 to 1.0, RNP will generally be permitted to make restricted payments, including distributions to its common unitholders, without substantive restriction. If the Fixed Charge Coverage ratio is less than 1.75 to 1.0, RNP will generally be permitted to make restricted payments, including distributions to its common unitholders, up to an aggregate $60.0 million basket plus certain other amounts referred to as \u201cincremental funds\u201d under the Indenture. For the year ended December 31, 2014, RNP\u2019s Fixed Charge Coverage ratio was 3.60 to 1.00.\nUnder the GE Credit Agreement, in the event that, on a pro forma basis, less than 30% of the commitment amount is available for borrowing on any distribution date, then in order to make a distribution on such date (a) RNP must maintain a first lien leverage ratio no greater than 1.0 to 1 on a pro forma basis and (b) the sum of (i) the undrawn amount under the GE Credit Facility and (ii) cash maintained by RNP and its subsidiaries in collateral deposit accounts must be at least $5 million (after giving effect to the distribution). In addition, before RNP can make distributions, there cannot be any default under the GE Credit Agreement. The GE Credit Agreement also contains a requirement that RNP maintain a first lien leverage ratio not to exceed 1.0 to 1 at the end of each fiscal quarter where less than 30% of the commitment amount is available for drawing under the GE Credit Facility or a default has occurred and is continuing. As of December 31, 2014, the first lien leverage ratio was 0.2 to 1.\nWe are subject to covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness and preferred stock and may be subject to additional agreements governing other future indebtedness or preferred stock. These covenants restrict our ability to, among other things, incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness, guarantees and other contingent obligations, incur liens, make negative pledges, pay dividends or make other distributions, make payments to our subsidiaries, make certain loans and investments, consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our or RNP\u2019s assets, enter into sale-leaseback transactions and enter into transactions with affiliates. Any failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the A&R GSO Credit Agreement, the Subscription Agreement, the GE Credit Agreement or the RNP Notes. Upon a default, unless waived, the lenders under our A&R GSO Credit Agreement or our GE Credit Agreement and holders of our RNP Notes would have all remedies available to a secured lender, including the ability to cause the outstanding amounts of such indebtedness to become due and payable in full, institute foreclosure proceedings against our or RNP\u2019s assets, and force us or RNP into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to repay the loans under the A&R GSO Credit Agreement or the GE Credit Agreement or to repurchase the RNP Notes or Series E Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of certain \u201cchange of control\u201d events relating to RNP.\nUpon the occurrence of a certain events defined as a \u201cchange of control\u201d under the Subscription Agreement, each of the Series E Purchasers may require us to repurchase some or all of our Series E Preferred Stock at a repurchase price equal to $1,000 per share (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or the like), plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon. These events would also constitute an event of default under the A&R GSO Credit Agreement, allowing the lenders thereunder to accelerate the loans under the agreement. The definition of a \u201cchange of control\u201d for these purposes includes, among other things, the issuance by RNP of any equity interests to any third party (other than equity compensation issued by RNP in the ordinary course of business); provided that a one-time issuance by RNP of no more than two million common units in the aggregate will not be a \u201cchange of control\u201d if the board of directors of the general partner of RNP determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such issuance is inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable law, as modified by the limited partnership agreement of RNP. For further information regarding these terms, see \u201cNote 25 - Subsequent Events\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in \u201cPart II-Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this report.\nIn addition, upon the occurrence of a change of control of RNP (as defined in the Indenture) each holder of the RNP Notes may require RNP to repurchase some or all of the RNP Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of their face amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Further, the occurrence of such a change of control would constitute an event of default under the GE Credit Agreement, allowing the lenders thereunder to accelerate the loans under the agreement.\nIf a change of control event occurs, we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy our obligations under the A&R GSO Credit Agreement, the Subscription Agreement, the Indenture and/or the GE Credit Agreement. Our failure to satisfy these obligations would be a default under the applicable agreement giving rise to the applicable counterparties\u2019 right to pursue remedies against us. As a result, any failure to meet these obligations would have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisks Related to Our Consolidated Business, Liquidity, Financial Condition, and Results of Operations\nWe have never operated at a profit. If RNP\u2019s current revenue, income or cash flow levels decrease or if we do not become profitable on an ongoing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations.\nWe have a history of operating losses and have never operated at a profit. From our inception on December 18, 1981 through December 31, 2014, we have an accumulated deficit of $417.3 million. If RNP\u2019s current revenues, income or cash flow levels decrease or if we do not become profitable on an ongoing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations. Ultimately, our ability to remain in business may depend upon earning a profit from our wood fibre processing business and, unless we sell RNP, RNP\u2019s nitrogen fertilizer business. Failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments or other business activities, reduce or eliminate future borrowings, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Failure to pay our indebtedness on time would constitute an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, which would give rise to our lenders\u2019 ability to accelerate the obligations under such agreements and seek other remedies against us.\nRNP is exploring and evaluating potential strategic alternatives and there can be no assurance that RNP will be successful in identifying, or completing any strategic alternative, that any such strategic alternative will yield additional value for us or that the process will not have an adverse impact on our business.\nOn February 17, 2015, RNP announced that the General Partner\u2019s board of directors had initiated a process to explore and evaluate potential strategic alternatives for RNP, which may include a sale of RNP, a merger with another party, a sale of some or all of its assets, or another strategic transaction. However, there can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction. In addition, RNP expects to incur substantial expenses associated with identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives. The process of exploring strategic alternatives may be time consuming and disruptive to RNP\u2019s business operations and, if the General Partner is unable to effectively manage the process, RNP\u2019s and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. No decision has been made with respect to any transaction and we cannot assure you that the General Partner will be able to identify and undertake any transaction that allows our shareholders to realize an increase in the value of their stock or provide any guidance on the timing of such action, if any. We also cannot assure you that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to our shareholders than that reflected in the current stock price. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our and RNP\u2019s control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in RNP\u2019s business and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms. A transaction to sell all or substantially all of RNP\u2019s assets, including by way of a merger, generally requires the approval of the holders of a majority of RNP\u2019s outstanding common units (including common units held by us). The sale of all or substantially all of Rentech\u2019s assets must be authorized by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of our capital stock then issued and outstanding. We and the General Partner do not intend to comment regarding the evaluation of strategic alternatives until such time as the General Partner\u2019s board of directors has determined the outcome of the process or otherwise has deemed that disclosure is appropriate. As a consequence, perceived uncertainties related to the future of RNP may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and volatility in the market price of our common stock and RNP\u2019s common units and may make it more difficult for RNP to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners.\nA sale of RNP likely would be a change of control as defined in the A&R GSO Credit Agreement and the Subscription Agreement relating to the Series E Preferred Stock. A change of control would trigger the right of the lenders under the A&R GSO Credit Agreement to be repaid and trigger the right of the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock to be repurchased, which could have major effects on our liquidity and/or require us to negotiate settlements with these lenders and holders. For further discussion, see the risk factor captioned \u201cWe may not have sufficient funds to repay the loans under the A&R GSO Credit Agreement or the GE Credit Agreement or to repurchase the RNP Notes or Series E Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of certain \u2018change of control\u2019 events relating to RNP\u201d in this report.\nThere are significant risks associated with construction, expansion and other projects that may prevent completion of those projects on budget, on schedule or at all.\nWe intend to continue to expand our wood fibre processing business through the construction of future wood pellet projects and may undertake additional expansion projects at our Fertilizer Facilities. Projects of the scope and scale we are undertaking or may undertake in the future entail significant risks, including:\n\u2022\nunanticipated cost increases;\n\u2022\nunforeseen engineering or environmental problems;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages;\n\u2022\nweather interference;\n\u2022\nunavailability or failure of necessary equipment; and\n\u2022\nunavailability of financing on acceptable terms.\nConstruction, equipment or staffing problems or difficulties in obtaining any of the requisite licenses, permits and authorizations from regulatory authorities could increase the total cost, delay or prevent the construction or completion of a project. Expansion projects also increase operational risk due to the operation of new equipment and the integration of new equipment into facility operations.\nIn addition, we cannot assure you that we will have adequate sources of funding to undertake or complete major projects. As a result, we may need to obtain additional debt and/or equity financing to complete such projects. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain other debt or equity financing on acceptable terms or at all. Moreover, if we are able to complete these projects, production levels at our facilities may not meet expectations that we have set.\nAs a result of these factors, we cannot assure you that our projects will commence operations on schedule or at all, that the costs for the projects will not exceed budgeted amounts or that production levels will achieve the expectations that we have set. Failure to complete a project on budget, on schedule or at all or to achieve expected production levels may adversely impact our ability to grow our business.\nAny operational disruption at our facilities, as a result of equipment failure, an accident, adverse weather, a natural disaster or another interruption, could result in a reduction of sales volumes and could cause us to incur substantial expenditures. A prolonged disruption could materially affect the cash flow we expect from our facilities, or lead to a default under our debt agreements.\nThe equipment at our facilities could fail and could be difficult to replace. Our facilities may be subject to significant interruption if they were to experience a major accident or equipment failure, including accidents or equipment failures caused during expansion projects, or if they were damaged by severe weather or natural disaster. Significant shutdowns at our facilities could significantly reduce the amount of product available for sale, which could reduce or eliminate profits and cash flow from our operations. For example, in March 2014, we experienced an operational disruption at one of our wood chipping facilities, and in the fourth quarter of 2013, we experienced operational disruptions at both of our Fertilizer Facilities, which in each case negatively affected our results of operations. In the case of the wood chipping facility, a fire started in the maintenance area during normal welding and grinding operations, and approximately 65% of the facility was lost in the fire, including the entire electrical system. We deployed portable and other temporary chipping systems to supply partial volumes to the facility\u2019s customer while the facility was rebuilt. Construction of a new facility and supporting infrastructure was completed in September 2014. Our East Dubuque Facility halted production due to a fire and operated at reduced rates following its turnaround after the discovery of the need for repairs to the foundation of one of its syngas compressors. Our Pasadena Facility also underwent a turnaround in December 2013, which lasted\nlonger than anticipated due to issues with a contractor and weather delays. In addition, we are preparing to replace the ammonia synthesis converter at our East Dubuque Facility, which we expect to be completed by the end of 2016. However, if the existing ammonia synthesis converter were to fail or suffer damage prior to completion of its replacement, this could cause a shutdown of our East Dubuque Facility.\nRepairs to our facilities could be expensive, and could be so extensive that our facilities could not economically be placed back into service. It has become increasingly difficult to obtain replacement parts for equipment and the unavailability of replacement parts could impede our ability to make repairs to our facilities when needed. We currently maintain property insurance, including business interruption insurance, but we may not have sufficient coverage, or may be unable in the future to obtain sufficient coverage at reasonable costs. A prolonged disruption at our facilities could materially affect the cash flow we expect from our facilities, or lead to a default under our debt agreements. In addition, operations at our Fertilizer Facilities are subject to hazards inherent in chemical processing. Some of those hazards may cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. As a result, operational disruptions at our facilities could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Chief Executive Officer transition involves significant risks and our ability to successfully manage this transition and other organizational change could impact our business results.\nMr. Forman was elected as our Chief Executive Officer and President on December 9, 2014. He is in the process of assessing our business and refining our strategy and operations. Leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage, and an inadequate transition of our CEO may cause disruption to our business, including our relationships with customers. In addition, we continue to execute a number of significant business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies. Successfully managing these changes, including retention of particularly key employees, is critical to our business success. This includes developing organization capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense.\nWe may have to raise substantial additional capital to execute our business plan and, in the event that our current and expected sources of funding are insufficient, to fund working capital and to continue our operations. Competitors with superior access to capital may have a substantial advantage over us.\nWe would require additional capital to pursue acquisitions of wood chipping or wood pellet businesses, to refinance our existing indebtedness and to pursue additional wood pellet projects. Our competitors who have superior access to capital may have a competitive advantage over us in these activities. In addition, since we have never operated at a profit, we may require additional capital to fund our working capital needs after we have exhausted our current cash on hand if we are unable to operate at a profit in the future. Our failure to raise additional capital when needed would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and cash flows and our ability to execute our business plan.\nChanges in ownership of shares of our common stock could result in the loss of our ability to use our net operating losses.\nWe have accumulated substantial operating losses. For federal and state tax purposes, we may \u201ccarry forward\u201d these losses to offset current and future taxable income and thereby reduce our tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. As of December 31, 2014, we had $176.7 million of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards. We believe our net operating loss carryforwards are an important asset of the Company.\nRealization of any benefit from our tax net operating losses is dependent on: (1) our ability to generate future taxable income and (2) the absence of certain future \u201cownership changes\u201d of our common stock. An \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in the applicable federal income tax rules, would place significant limitations, on an annual basis, on the use of such net operating losses to offset any future taxable income we may generate. Such limitations, in conjunction with the net operating loss expiration provisions, could effectively eliminate our ability to use a substantial portion of our net operating losses to offset any future taxable income.\nThe issuance of shares of our common stock could cause an \u201cownership change\u201d which would limit our ability to use our net operating losses. Issuances of shares of our common stock that could cause an \u201cownership change\u201d include the issuance of shares of common stock in financing or strategic transactions or upon future conversion or exercise of outstanding options and warrants.\nExecution of our strategy depends, in part, upon the continuing treatment of RNP as a partnership for tax purposes, as well as the continuing ability to obtain partnership treatment for a potential master limited partnership to which we would transfer our wood fibre processing assets.\nThe present United States federal income tax treatment of publicly traded limited partnerships, including RNP, may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any time, including on a retroactive basis. For example, from time to time, members of Congress and the President propose and consider substantive changes to the existing United States federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded limited partnerships, including the elimination of the qualifying income exception under Internal Revenue Code Section 7704(d), upon which RNP relies for its treatment as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes. Any modification to the United States federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be retroactively applied and could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the exception for RNP to be treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes. However, we are unable to predict whether any such changes, or other proposals, will ultimately be enacted or, if enacted, whether they will be enacted in their proposed form, or whether they will apply to us. Any such changes could cause a substantial reduction in the value of our common units.\nWe have identified and disclosed material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements, adversely affect investor confidence, impair the value of our common stock and increase our cost of raising capital. There is also the risk that additional control weaknesses could be discovered.\nOur management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 relating to (i) the review of the cash flow forecasts used in the accounting for long-lived asset recoverability and goodwill impairment, (ii) the determination of the goodwill impairment charge in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and (iii) maintaining documentation supporting management\u2019s review of events and changes in circumstances that indicate it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment has occurred between annual impairment tests. For a discussion of our internal control over financial reporting and a description of the identified material weaknesses, see \u201cPart II-Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\u201d\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Although management has implemented, and is continuing to implement, certain procedures to strengthen our internal controls, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or following our remediation plan, or if we discover additional control weaknesses, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, we could be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC and NASDAQ, including a delisting from NASDAQ, securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect investor confidence, impair the value of our common stock and increase our cost of raising capital.\nRisks Related to the Market for Rentech Common Stock\nThe issuance of 100,000 shares of our Series E Preferred Stock to certain funds managed by or affiliated with GSO Capital in April 2014 reduces the relative voting power of holders of our common stock, may dilute the ownership of such holders, and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOn April 9, 2014, we entered into a Subscription Agreement, or the Subscription Agreement, with funds managed by or affiliated with GSO Capital, or the Series E Purchasers, pursuant to which we sold 100,000 shares of our Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, or the Series E Preferred Stock, to the Series E Purchasers, which is convertible into approximately 16.4% of our outstanding common stock, on an as-converted basis. As holders of our Series E Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, on an as-converted basis, together with holders of our common stock as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our common stock holders, the issuance of the Series E Preferred Stock to the Series E Purchasers has effectively reduced the relative voting power of the holders of our common stock.\nIn addition, conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock to common stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. We have granted the Series E Purchasers registration rights in respect of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock and any shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock. These registration rights would facilitate the resale of such securities into the public market, and any such resale would increase the number of shares of our common stock available for public trading. Sales by the Series E Purchasers of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThe Series E Purchasers may exercise significant influence over us, including through their ability to elect up to two members of our board of directors, or our Board.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the shares of Series E Preferred Stock owned by the Series E Purchasers represent approximately 16.4% of the voting rights of our common stock, on an as-converted basis. As a result, the Series E Purchasers have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of our stockholders. In addition, our articles of incorporation grant certain consent rights to the holders of Series E Preferred Stock in respect of certain actions by us, including (a) issuing any indebtedness directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable for any capital stock; (b) redeeming or repurchasing or permitting any of our subsidiaries to redeem or repurchase any shares of any class or series of our capital stock, subject to certain exceptions; and (c) increasing or decreasing the maximum number of directors of our Board to more than ten persons or to less than eight persons, or collectively, the Protective Provisions. The Subscription Agreement also imposes a number of affirmative and negative covenants on us. The Series E Purchasers may have interests that diverge from, or even conflict with, those of our other shareholders. For example, the Series E Purchasers may have an interest in directly or indirectly pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their other equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to us.\nIn addition, our articles of incorporation grant the Series E Purchasers certain rights to designate directors to serve on our Board. For so long as the Series E Purchasers and their permitted transferees (i) own at least 85% of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock issued as of the original issue date, the holders of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, are entitled to elect two individuals to our Board, or (ii) own at least 42.5% of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock issued as of the original issue date, the holders of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, are entitled to elect one individual to our Board. Under the Subscription Agreement, in addition to the rights under our articles of incorporation, for so long as the Series E Purchasers in the aggregate have record and beneficial ownership of shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock, or the Conversion Shares, that constitute at least 6% of our outstanding common stock, the Series E Purchasers\u2019 collectively have the right to nominate one person for election to our Board. For so long as the Series E Purchasers in the aggregate have record and beneficial ownership of Conversion Shares that constitute more than 18% of our outstanding common stock and less than 42.5% of the Series E Preferred Stock issued on the date of the Subscription Agreement, the Series E Purchasers collectively are entitled to nominate a total of two nominees for election to our Board. For so long as the Series E Purchasers have the\nright to appoint or nominate at least one person to our Board in accordance with the Subscription Agreement, the Series E Purchasers collectively have the right to appoint one observer to our Board who must be reasonably acceptable to us. Notwithstanding the fact that all directors will be subject to fiduciary duties and applicable law, the interests of the directors appointed by the Series E Purchasers may differ from the interests of our security holders as a whole or of our other directors.\nThe Series E Preferred Stock issued to the Series E Purchasers has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of our common shareholders. Such preferential rights could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and may result in the interests of the Series E Purchasers differing from those of our common stockholders.\nAs holders of Series E Preferred Stock, the Series E Purchasers have the right to receive a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid out of our assets available for distribution to shareholders, before any payment may be made to holders of any other class or series of capital stock, an amount equal to the greater of (a) the original issue price plus all unpaid and accumulated dividends thereon (including any amounts accrued and unpaid since the last dividend payment date) of each outstanding share of Series E Preferred Stock held and (b) the amount that such holder would have been entitled to receive upon our liquidation, dissolution and winding up if all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock had been converted into common stock immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.\nIn addition, dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock accrue and are cumulative, whether or not declared by our Board, at the rate of 4.5% per annum on the sum of the original issue price plus all unpaid accrued and accumulated dividends thereon, whether or not declared by our Board. Moreover, if we declare or pay a cash dividend on our common stock, we are required to declare and pay a dividend on the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock on a pro rata basis with the common stock determined on an as-converted basis.\nThe holders of our Series E Preferred Stock also have certain redemption rights or put rights, including, but not limited to, upon the earliest of: (a) the seventh anniversary of the original issue date, (b) certain change in control events involving us, (c) a bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or the winding up of our affairs, or (d) uncured breach of any of the Protective Provisions, which, if exercised, could require us to repurchase any or all of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock at their original issue price plus all unpaid accrued and accumulated dividends thereon, including any amounts accrued and unpaid since the last dividend payment date, or the Redemption Price. In the event that we fail to redeem or purchase the Series E Preferred Stock and to pay to the Series E Purchaser the Redemption Price of such shares on the applicable redemption or purchase date, whether or not such payment or redemption is legally permissible or is otherwise prohibited, such Series E Purchaser will have the right, but not obligation, to cause a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, DSHC, LLC, or DSHC, to purchase any or all of the Series E Preferred Stock (other than the Series E Preferred Stock that has been redeemed). In such a case, the purchase price for the Series E Preferred Stock will equal (a) $1,000 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or similar transactions with respect to the Series E Preferred Stock), plus (b) all accrued and unpaid dividends on such Series E Preferred Stock (including all amounts accrued since the last dividend payment date). DSHC\u2019s obligation is secured by 9,453,314 common units of RNP owned by DSHC.\nOur obligations to pay accrued and accumulated dividends, whether or not declared by our Board, to the holders of our Series E Preferred Stock on a pro-rata basis with the common stock when we declare or pay a cash dividend, and to repurchase any and all of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock under certain circumstances, could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Our obligations to the holders of Series E Preferred Stock could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. The preferential rights could also result in divergent interests between the Series E Purchasers and those of our common shareholders.\nWe have a substantial overhang of common stock and future sales of our common stock or of securities linked to our common stock may cause substantial dilution and may negatively affect the market price of our shares.\nAs of December 31, 2014, there were 229.3 million shares of our common stock outstanding. As of that date, we also had an aggregate of 15.7 million shares of common stock that may be issued upon exercise of restricted stock units, options and warrants, and 45.0 million shares of common stock that may be issued upon the conversion of Series E Preferred Stock. In addition, we have one shelf registration statement covering $200.0 million aggregate initial offering price of securities (up to all of which could be issued as shares of common stock) for issuance in future financing transactions. In the event that we acquire companies or assets, we may issue additional shares of stock to acquire those companies or assets.\nThe sale of common stock and common stock equivalents in material amounts may be necessary to finance the progress of our business plan and operations. Certain future holders of our securities may be granted rights to participate in or to require us to file registration statements with the SEC for resale of common stock.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of our common stock into the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale, will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock (including shares issued upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of other securities), or the perception that such sales could occur, may materially and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 76978, "SIC": 2400, "TIC": "RTKHQ"}
