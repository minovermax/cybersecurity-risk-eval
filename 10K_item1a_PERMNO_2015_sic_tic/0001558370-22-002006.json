{"cik": "1069183", "company": "AXON ENTERPRISE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, our past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of our future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate our results or trends in future periods. You should carefully consider the trends, risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC before making any investment decision with respect to our securities. If any of the following trends, risks or uncertainties actually occurs or continues, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected, the trading prices of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\nStrategic Risks\nWe are materially dependent on acceptance of our products by law enforcement markets, throughout the world. If law enforcement agencies do not continue to purchase and use our products, our revenues will be adversely affected.\nAt any point, due to external factors and opinions, whether or not related to product performance, law enforcement agencies may elect to no longer purchase our CEDs or other products.\nWe substantially depend on sales of our TASER CEDs, and if these products do not continue to be widely accepted, our growth prospects will be diminished.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we derived a significant portion of our revenues from sales of TASER brand devices and related cartridges, and expect to depend on sales of these products for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. A decrease in the selling prices of, or demand for these products, or their failure to maintain broad market acceptance, would significantly harm our growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to design, introduce, sell and deploy new products or new product features successfully, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to develop new products or new product features that achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost-effective manner. These products include, but are not limited to, Axon Records, Axon Respond, and future generations of the TASER CED and Axon Body Cameras. The development of new products and new product features is complex, time consuming and expensive, and we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. We may choose to carry higher level of inventories to mitigate the risk of production delays, which may in turn expose us to an increased risk of obsolescence.\nWe are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based productivity and real-time operations SaaS solutions, which we intend to broadly deploy to a large number of customers. Customer requirements for these products are complex and varied. If we are unable to develop scalable solutions that can be consistently configured for customers with minimal effort, or if we are unable to grow a professional services team that can consistently configure our products to meet the requirements of large numbers of customers in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to broadly scale our cloud-based productivity and real-time operations SaaS solutions could be negatively impacted, and our deployment costs could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that products that we may develop in the future will achieve market acceptance. If we fail to develop new products or new product features on a timely basis that achieve market acceptance, our business, financial results and competitive position could be adversely affected.\nWe face risks associated with rapid technological change and new competing products.\nThe technology associated with law enforcement devices and software is receiving significant attention and is rapidly evolving. While we have some patent protection in certain key areas of our CED, Axon device and SaaS technology, new technology may result in competing products that operate outside our patents and could present significant competition for our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and competitive position.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to expand sales through direct sales and distributors and our inability to increase direct sales or recruit new distributors would negatively affect our sales.\nOur distribution strategy is to pursue sales through multiple channels with an emphasis on direct sales and independent distributors. We are focusing on direct sales to larger agencies through our regional sales managers and our inability to grow sales to these agencies in this manner could adversely affect our sales. Our inability to establish relationships with and retain law enforcement equipment distributors, who we believe can successfully sell our products, would adversely affect our sales. If we do not competitively price our products, meet the requirements of\nour distributors or end-users, provide adequate marketing support, or comply with the terms of our distribution arrangements, our distributors may fail to aggressively market our products or may terminate their relationships with us. These developments would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales. Our reliance on the sales of our products by others also makes it more difficult to predict our revenues, cash flow and operating results.\nIn certain states and foreign jurisdictions we have decided to pursue sales directly with law enforcement customers, rather than working through established distribution channels. Our customers may have strong working relationships with distributors and we may face resistance to this change. If we do not overcome this resistance and effectively build a direct relationship with our customers, sales may be adversely affected.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, and other strategic investments may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may consider additional acquisitions, joint ventures, or other strategic investments as part of our long-term business strategy. These transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, expected synergies are not achieved, we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, we experience difficulty in the integration or coordination of new employees, business systems, and technology, we incur unanticipated liabilities or impairments, or management\u2019s attention is diverted from our other businesses. These events could harm our operating results, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Patrick W. Smith, our Chief Executive Officer.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to retain executive officers, specifically Patrick W. Smith, and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business, prospects, new product development, financial condition and operating results.\nOperational Risks\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nA disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, fire, explosion, failure to contain hazardous materials, industrial accident, utility failure, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, public health crisis, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other mission-critical functions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results as well as expose us to claims, litigation and governmental investigations and fines.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has adversely affected workforces, economies, and financial markets globally, and led to an economic downturn. As an essential provider of products and services for law enforcement and other first responders, we remain focused on protecting the health and well-being of our employees while assuring the continuity of our business operations.\nAlthough the severity of the pandemic has lessened with the rollout of vaccines and travel restrictions, remote working and schooling and social distancing requirements have been lifted or eased in varying degrees in varying locations throughout the United States and the world, continuing surges and variants have caused certain restrictions to be re-implemented in varying degrees and in varying locations. The severity and duration of the pandemic, including future surges and variants, is impossible to predict. As a result, the ongoing pandemic continues to present various risks that may affect our operations and financial results, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf Manufacturing disruptions at our Scottsdale headquarters or at our suppliers;\n\u25cf A change in our classification as an essential business that impairs our ability to continue operating;\n\u25cf Economic slowdowns that negatively affect municipal and state tax collections and put pressure on law enforcement budgets that in turn increases the risk that our customers will be unable to appropriate funds for existing or future contracts with us; this could also affect customer demand and ability to pay, cause decreases in sales, and negatively impact the realizability of our accounts and notes receivable and contract assets;\n\u25cf Costs incurred to shut down and decontaminate our facilities if the virus is detected;\n\u25cf Extended illness, incapacitation or death of key personnel or executives;\n\u25cf Ongoing governmental mandates to shutdown factories or limit travel and the movement of people that causes interruptions to our business, supply chain or extended supply chain;\n\u25cf Compounding risk from continued surges in infections around the world, including in the U.S.; and\n\u25cf Additional airline bankruptcies or further reduction in very limited global freight capacity that causes interruptions to our supply chain or extended supply chain\nThese events have had and could continue to have an impact on our operations. If our backup and mitigation plans are not sufficient to minimize business disruption, our financial results could be adversely affected. We are continuously monitoring our operations and intend to take appropriate actions to mitigate the risks arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, but there can be no assurances that we will be successful in doing so.\nHigher costs or unavailability of materials could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe depend on certain domestic and international suppliers for the delivery of components used in the assembly of our products. Our reliance on third-party suppliers creates risks related to our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components or sub-assemblies and reduced control over pricing and timing of delivery of components and sub-assemblies. Specifically, we depend on suppliers of sub-assemblies, machined parts, injection molded plastic parts, printed circuit boards, custom wire fabrications and other miscellaneous customer parts for our products. Although we have and are implementing additional long-term agreements with strategic suppliers to mitigate the risk of supply continuity, there remains risk across our supply chain while we extend our supplier contract program, and there is no guarantee that supply will not be interrupted.\nSingle or sole-source components used in the manufacture of our products may become unavailable or discontinued. Delays caused by industry allocations or obsolescence may take weeks or months to resolve. In some cases, parts obsolescence may require a product re-design to ensure quality replacement components. These delays could cause significant delays in manufacturing and loss of sales, leading to adverse effects significantly impacting our financial condition or results of operations and could injure our reputation.\nA significant number of our raw materials or components are comprised of petroleum-based products or incur some form of landed cost associated with transporting the raw materials or components to our facility. Our freight and import costs and the timely delivery of our products could be adversely impacted by a number of factors which could reduce the profitability of our operations, including: higher fuel costs; potential port closures; customs clearance issues; increased government regulation or regulatory changes for imports of foreign products into the U.S.; delays created by terrorist attacks or threats, public health issues, national disasters or work stoppages; and other matters. Any interruption of supply for any material components of our products could significantly delay the shipment of our products and have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and financial condition. For example, other industries are experiencing a significant shortage of semiconductors in their supply chains. We are tracking second-and third-level constraints and have taken steps to mitigate the potential impacts by building in buffers in our raw materials inventory and ensuring our suppliers have adequate access to raw material levels aligned to our forecasts. Disruptions in the semi-conductor supply chain could cause a disruption in our ability to make our products.\nInternational or domestic geopolitical or other events, including the imposition of new or increased tariffs and/or quotas by the U.S. government on any of these raw materials or components and other government trade policies, could adversely impact the supply and cost of these raw materials or components, and could adversely impact the profitability of our operations. In particular, the implementation of tariffs and trade restrictions as well as changes in trade policies between the U.S. and China may have an adverse effect on our supply chain from a sourcing and cost perspective. We source certain raw materials from China, as do some of our suppliers. While we have actively implemented programs to increase buffer inventory levels as well as transition from China along with secondary sources of raw materials outside of China, future actions or events could result in a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and financial condition.\nTo the extent demand for our products increases, our future success will be dependent upon our ability to manage our growth and to increase manufacturing production capacity, which may be accomplished by the implementation of customized manufacturing automation equipment.\nTo the extent demand for our products increases significantly in future periods, one of our key challenges will be to increase our production capacity to meet sales demand while maintaining product quality. Our primary strategies to accomplish this include introducing additional shifts, increasing the physical size of our assembly facilities, the hiring of additional production staff, and the implementation of additional customized automation equipment. The investments we make in this equipment may not yield the anticipated labor and material efficiencies. Our inability to meet any future increase in sales demand or effectively manage our expansion could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial results and financial condition.\nDelays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenues and cash flows.\nThe development of CEDs, devices, sensors and software is a complex and time-consuming process. New products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. Our focus on our SaaS platform also presents complex development issues. Significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our business, financial results and competitive position.\nWe expend significant resources in anticipation of a sale due to our lengthy sales cycle and may receive no revenue in return.\nGenerally, law enforcement and corrections agencies consider a wide range of issues before committing to purchase our products, including product benefits, training costs, the cost to use our products in addition to, or in place of, other products, budget constraints and product reliability, safety and efficacy. The length of our sales cycle may range from a few weeks to as long as several years. Adverse publicity surrounding our products or the safety of such products has in the past, and could in the future, lengthen our sales cycle with customers. In the past, we believe that our sales were adversely impacted by negative publicity surrounding our products or the use of our products. We may incur substantial selling costs and expend significant effort in connection with the evaluation of our products by potential customers before they place an order. If these potential customers do not purchase our products, we will have expended significant resources and received no revenue in return.\nChanges in civil forfeiture laws may affect our customers\u2019 ability to purchase our products.\nSome of our customers use funds seized through civil forfeiture proceedings to fund the purchase of our products. Legislative changes could impact our customers\u2019 ability to seize funds or use seized funds to fund purchases. Changes in civil forfeiture statutes or regulations are outside of our control and could limit the amount of funds available to our customers, which could adversely affect the sale of our products.\nIf our security measures or those of our third-party cloud storage providers are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to customers\u2019 data or our data, our network, data centers and service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nOur service involves the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of information or the total or partial deletion or encryption of all stored customer data, litigation and possible liability. We devote significant resources to engineer secure products and ensure security vulnerabilities are mitigated, and we require our third-party service providers to do so as well. Despite these efforts, security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, and malfeasance or otherwise. Breaches could occur during transfer of data to data centers or at any time, and result in unauthorized access to our data or our customers\u2019 data. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data or our customers\u2019 data. Additionally, hackers may develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack or gain access to our networks and data centers.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently, grow more complex over time, and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Moreover, our security measures and those of our third-party service providers or customers may not detect such security breaches if they occur. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data, to prevent data loss, and to prevent or detect security breaches, we cannot assure that such measures will provide absolute security, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks.\nA security breach could expose us to a risk of loss or inappropriate use of proprietary and sensitive data, or the denial of access to this data. A real or perceived security breach could also result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, disrupt our business, damage our reputation, lead to legal liability, negatively impact our future sales and significantly harm our growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nDefects or disruptions in our services could impact demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability.\nWe currently serve our Axon Evidence customers from third-party cloud storage providers based in the U.S. and other countries. Interruptions in our service, or loss or corruption of digital evidence, may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to file litigation against us, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable.\nSince our customers use our services for important aspects of their operations, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers\u2019 operations. As a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. We could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our warranty expense, an increase in collection cycles for and decline in the collectability of accounts receivable, and an increase in the expense and risk of litigation.\nDefects in our products could reduce demand for our products and result in a loss of sales, delay in market acceptance and damage to our reputation.\nComplex components and assemblies used in our products may contain undetected defects that are subsequently discovered at any point in the life of the product. Defects in our products could result in a loss of sales, delay in market acceptance, damage to our reputation and increased warranty costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and competitive position.\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur international operations are significant, and we plan to continue to grow internationally by acquiring existing entities or setting up new legal entities in new markets. In certain international markets, we have limited operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following:\n\u25cf Restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.\n\u25cf Import and export requirements, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, product certification requirements, and customs classifications that may prevent us from offering products or providing services to a particular market or obtaining necessary parts and components to manufacture products, which may lead to decreased sales and may increase our operating costs.\n\u25cf Longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud.\n\u25cf Uncertainty regarding liability for our products and services, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent.\n\u25cf Different labor laws and customs, existence of workers\u2019 councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions.\nAdditionally, changes in international local political, economic, regulatory, tax, social, and labor conditions may adversely harm our business and compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include, among others, environmental regulations, internal control and disclosure rules, privacy and data protection requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and competition regulations, among others.\nOur business in the United Kingdom may be negatively impacted by the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU (commonly referred to as \"Brexit\"). The exit itself could negatively impact the United Kingdom and other economies, which could adversely affect sales of our products and services. We may also experience increased volatility in the value of the pound sterling, the euro and other European currencies. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the United Kingdom and the EU, and we may incur additional costs or need to make operational changes as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks.\nViolations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international growth efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain our key management, sales and technical personnel.\nOur success depends upon the continued service of our key management personnel. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified technical employees. Although we have employment agreements with our officers and other members of our executive management team, the employment of such persons is \u201cat-will\u201d and either we or the employee can terminate the employment relationship at any time, subject to the applicable terms of the employment agreements.\nWe have unique equity incentives designed to attract and retain long-term employees. We utilize these plans to align pay and performance and drive shareholder returns while reducing near-term cash expenditures. Our equity incentives and ongoing stock and option grants are subject to having sufficient shares approved by our shareholders. If we are unable to obtain shareholder approval, we may be unable to attract and retain top talent. The competition for our key employees is intense and market competition for top talent has increased since our introduction of our innovative performance-based stock compensation plans in 2018. The loss of the service of one or more of our key personnel could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nGlobal economic conditions could materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nOur inability to offset price inflation in our materials, components, shipping, or labor through increased prices to customers with long-term fixed contracts and formula-based or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to us, or we may be unable to manage these components effectively.\nOur products contain many parts purchased globally from numerous suppliers, including single-source direct suppliers, which exposes us to multiple potential sources of component shortages. Unexpected changes in business\nconditions, materials pricing, labor issues, wars, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, trade and shipping disruptions, port congestions and other factors beyond our or our suppliers\u2019 control could also affect these suppliers\u2019 ability to deliver components to us or to remain solvent and operational. We have used alternative parts to mitigate the challenges caused by these shortages, but there is no guarantee we may be able to continually do so as we scale production to meet projected future sales activity. Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, or they decommit to us previously agreed to supply levels, it may reduce our access to components and require us to search for new suppliers. The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, as well as impact our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts. While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources for most of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all. As the scale of our hardware production increases, we will also need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport components at high volumes to our manufacturing facilities. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs, we may incur unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs, which may harm our business and operating results.\nFinancial Risks\nAn increasing percentage of our revenue is derived from subscription billing arrangements which may result in delayed cash collections and may increase customer credit risk on receivables and contract assets.\nA growing portion of our sales are derived from subscription billing arrangements and on an open credit basis. While we record an estimate of expected credit losses and perform ongoing reviews of trade accounts receivables, if we become aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, we may have to adjust our expected credit loss reserve, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWe may experience a decline in gross margins due to a shift in product sales from CEDs to software and sensors products and services which may continue to carry a lower gross margin.\nWe continue to invest in the growth of the Software and Sensors segment, and this expected growth may result in a higher percentage of total revenues being comprised of Software and Sensors products and services. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales for the Software and Sensors segment is currently lower than that of the TASER segment, and may continue to be lower in the future.\nSaaS revenue for Axon Evidence is recognized over the terms of the contracts, which may be several years, and, as such, trends in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nOur SaaS service revenue is generally recognized ratably over the terms of the contracts, which generally range from one to five years. As a result, most of the SaaS revenue we report each quarter is the result of agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, current positive or negative trends in this portion of our business may not be fully reflected in our revenue results for several periods.\nMost of our end-user customers are subject to budgetary and political constraints that may delay or prevent sales.\nMost of our end-user customers are government agencies. These agencies often do not set their own budgets and therefore, have limited control over the amount of money they can spend. In addition, these agencies experience political pressure that may dictate the manner in which they spend money. As a result, even if an agency wants to acquire our products, it may be unable to purchase them due to budgetary or political constraints, particularly in challenging economic environments. There can be no assurance that the economic, budgeting or political issues will not worsen and adversely impact sales of our products. Some government agency orders may also be canceled or substantially delayed due to budgetary, political or other scheduling delays, which frequently occur in connection with the acquisition of products by such agencies, and such cancellations may accelerate or be more severe than we have experienced historically.\nDue to municipal government funding rules, certain of our contracts are subject to appropriation, termination for convenience, or similar cancellation clauses, which could allow our customers to cancel or not exercise options to renew contracts in the future.\nAlthough we have entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipate the contracts will be completed, if agencies do not appropriate money in future year budgets, terminate contracts for convenience or if other cancellation clauses are invoked, revenue and cash associated with these bookings will not ultimately be recognized, and could result in a reduction to bookings and revenue.\nWe maintain most of our cash balances, some of which are not insured, at four depository institutions.\nWe maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents accounts at three depository institutions. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate balances in such accounts at these three institutions were $347.3 million. Our balances with these institutions regularly exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) insured limits for domestic deposits and various foreign deposit insurance programs covering our deposits in Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam.\nWe could suffer losses with respect to the uninsured balances if the depository institutions failed and the institution\u2019s assets were insufficient to cover its deposits and/or the governments did not take actions to support deposits in excess of existing insurance limits. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nStock compensation expense may have a material, unpredictable impact on our results of operations.\nWe have historically granted and expect to continue to grant stock-based compensation to key employees and non-employee directors as a means of attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel. All stock-based awards are required to be recognized in our financial statements based on their grant date fair values. The amount recognized for stock compensation expense could vary depending on a number of assumptions or changes that may occur.\nFor awards containing multiple service, performance and market conditions, where all conditions must be satisfied prior to vesting, compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is defined as the longest explicit, implicit or derived service period, based on management\u2019s estimate of the probability and timing of the performance criteria being satisfied, adjusted at each balance sheet date. Changes in the subjective and probability-based assumptions can materially affect the estimates of the fair value of the awards and timing of recognition of stock-based compensation expense and consequently, the related amount recognized in our statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nIf we achieve specific operational goals and the covered employees complete the requisite service conditions for the performance-based awards with multiple service, performance, and market conditions, including our CEO Performance Award and our eXponential Stock Performance Plan (\"XSPP\"), we will recognize stock compensation expense regardless of whether the market conditions are achieved and the underlying tranches vest.\nOur financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies.\nFor current and potential international customers whose contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, the relative change in local currency values creates relative fluctuations in our product pricing. These changes in international end-user costs may result in lost orders and reduce the competitiveness of our products in certain foreign markets. Additionally, intercompany sales to our non-U.S. dollar functional currency international subsidiaries are transacted in U.S. dollars which could increase our foreign exchange rate risk caused by foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\nFor non-U.S. dollar denominated sales, weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar generally leads us to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for our products. Should we decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar\u2019s strengthening, the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency denominated sales and earnings would be adversely affected. We do not currently engage in hedging activities. Fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency could result in a change in the U.S. dollar value of our foreign denominated assets and liabilities including accounts receivable. Therefore, the U.S. dollar equivalent collected on a given sale could be less than the amount invoiced causing the sale to be less profitable than contemplated.\nWe also import selected components which are used in the manufacturing of some of our products. Although our purchase orders are generally in U.S. dollars, weakness in the U.S. dollar could lead to price increases for the components.\nUnanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our operating results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates. Our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes, and changes in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits.\nWe are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. While we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nOur tax provision could also be impacted by changes in federal, state or international tax laws including fundamental tax law changes applicable to corporate multinationals.\nAdditionally, we may be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income-based taxes resulting from changes in federal, state, city or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions\u2019 administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period.\nOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate unexpectedly from quarter-to-quarter, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to various factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf budgetary cycles of municipal, state and federal law enforcement and corrections agencies;\n\u25cf market acceptance of our products and services;\n\u25cf the timing of large domestic and international orders;\n\u25cf the outcome of any existing or future litigation;\n\u25cf adverse publicity surrounding our products, the safety of our products, or the use of our products;\n\u25cf changes in our sales mix;\n\u25cf new product introduction costs;\n\u25cf increased raw material expenses;\n\u25cf changes in our operating expenses, including stock-based compensation expense;\n\u25cf changes in foreign currency exchange rates and\n\u25cf regulatory changes that may affect the marketability of our products.\nAs a result of these and other factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful in the short term, and our performance in a particular period may not be indicative of our performance in any future period.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nWe may face personal injury, wrongful death and other liability claims that harm our reputation and adversely affect our sales and financial condition.\nOur CED products are often used in aggressive confrontations that may result in serious, permanent bodily injury or death to those involved. Our CED products may be associated with these injuries. A person, or the family members of a person, injured in a confrontation or otherwise in connection with the use of our products, may bring legal action against us to recover damages on the basis of theories including wrongful death, personal injury, negligent design, defective product or inadequate warning. We are currently subject to a number of such lawsuits and we have been subject to significant adverse judgments and settlements. We may also be subject to lawsuits involving allegations of misuse of our products. If successful, wrongful death, personal injury, misuse and other claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and could result in negative publicity about our products. We incur significant legal expenses in defending these cases, and significant litigation could also result in a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, negative publicity and a potential award of monetary damages in excess of our insurance coverage. The outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that our existing or any future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nOther litigation may subject us to significant litigation costs and judgments and divert management attention from our business.\nWe have been or could in the future be involved in numerous other litigation matters relating to our products, contracts and business relationships, including litigation against persons whom we believe have infringed on our intellectual property, infringement litigation filed against us, litigation against a competitor, enforcement actions filed against us, and litigation involving the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d). Such matters have resulted, and are expected to continue to result in, substantial costs to us, including in the form of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, damages, fines or other penalties, whether pursuant to a judgment or settlement, and diversion of our management\u2019s attention, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. There is also a risk of adverse judgments, as the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.\nWe have been, and may be in the future, subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims, which could incur substantial litigation costs, result in significant damage awards, inhibit our use of certain technologies, and divert management attention from our business.\nMany companies own intellectual property rights that are directly or indirectly related to public safety technologies. These companies periodically demand licensing agreements or engage in litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of their patents, trademarks, copyrights, or trade secrets. Non-practicing entities also have patents they have been granted or otherwise acquired, including patents that are directly or indirectly related to public safety technologies. These entities may seek compensation for perceived infringement of their patents, including by filing claims against us, independent of the merit of any such claims. As we enter new markets, expand into new product categories, and otherwise offer new products, services, and technologies, additional intellectual property claims may be filed against us by these companies, entities, and other third parties. Additional intellectual property claims may also be filed against us as our current products, services, and technologies gain additional market share.\nIf our products, services, or technologies were found to infringe a third-party\u2019s proprietary rights, we could be forced to discontinue use of the protected technology or enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements in order to be able to sell our products. Such royalty and licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. We could also be required to pay substantial damages, fines or other penalties, indemnify customers or distributors, cease the manufacture, use, or sale of infringing products or processes, make proprietary source code\npublicly available, and/or expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing technologies. Our suppliers may not provide, or we may not be able to obtain, intellectual property indemnification sufficient to offset all damages, fines or other penalties resulting from any claims of intellectual property infringement brought against us or our customers. There is no guarantee that our use of conventional technology searching and brand clearance searching will identify all potential rights holders. Rights holders may demand payment for past infringements and/or force us to accept costly license terms or discontinue use of protected technology and/or works of authorship that may include, for example, photos, videos, and software. Our current research and development focus on developing software-based products, including that which is related to artificial intelligence or virtual reality, increases this risk.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and products may decrease and we may lose our competitive market advantage.\nOur future success depends upon our proprietary technology. Our protective measures for this proprietary technology include patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret protection. However, these protective measures, as well as our efforts to pursue such protective measures, may prove inadequate. For example, the value of intellectual property protection in certain countries may not be apparent until after such protection can no longer be pursued. As such, our intellectual property protection may not extend to all countries in which our products are distributed or will be distributed in the future. Though we work to protect our innovations, we may not be able to obtain protection for certain innovations. For example, we may be unable to patent some software-based products. The scope of any patent protection we have obtained, or may obtain, may not prevent others from developing and selling competing products. Despite our efforts, any intellectual property protection we obtain may be later determined to be insufficient or ineffective.\nOur protective measures may prove inadequate for reasons outside of our control. Different intellectual property laws between different countries may lead to differences in protection between such countries. In certain countries in which our products are distributed, the ability to effectively enforce intellectual property rights may not exist. Patent requirements differ by country and certain domestic or foreign laws may prohibit us from satisfying these requirements, creating a risk that some of our international patents may become unenforceable. Patents for older technologies, such as our M26 and X26E models of CEDs, have expired or will expire due to statutory limits on patent term. Despite policies and efforts to maintain secrecy, trade secrets and other confidential information we maintain, or may choose to maintain in the future, could be compromised by employees, partners, or other third parties.\nOnce established, there is no guarantee that our intellectual property rights will remain in force. Issued patents may be re-examined and subsequently ruled invalid or unenforceable. Our registered trademarks may also be diminished or lost. For example, there is a risk that our \u201cTASER\u201d trademark could become synonymous with the general product category of \u201cconducted energy devices\u201d. The right to stop others from misusing our trademarks and service marks in commerce depends, to some extent, on our ability to show evidence of enforcement of our rights against such misuse in commerce. Our efforts to stop improper use, if insufficient, may lead to loss of trademark and service mark rights, brand loyalty and notoriety among our customers and prospective customers.\nOur intellectual property may also be at risk if we are unable to defend from enforcement actions, such as that filed by the FTC against us regarding our acquisition of Vievu LLC from Safariland LLC on May 3, 2018. For additional discussion of this matter, refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If successful, the FTC is seeking a divestiture of Vievu along with Axon assets sufficient to stand up a viable competitor.\nInability to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our commercial efforts and competitive market advantage. Regardless of outcome, the prosecution of patent and other intellectual property claims is both costly and time consuming. Unauthorized use of our proprietary technology could divert our management\u2019s attention from our business, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results.\nInternationally, we can enforce patent rights only in the jurisdictions in which our patent applications have been granted.\nOur U.S. patents protect us from imported infringing products coming into the U.S. from abroad. We have made applications for patents in a few foreign countries; however, these may be inadequate to protect markets for our products in other foreign countries. Each patent is examined and granted according to the law of the country where it was filed independent of whether a U.S. patent on similar technology was granted. A patent in a foreign country may be subject to cancellation if the claimed invention has not been sold in that country. Meeting the requirements of working invention differs by country and ranges from sales in the country to manufacturing in the country. U.S. export law, or the laws of some foreign countries, may prohibit us from satisfying the requirements for working the invention, creating a risk that some of our international patents may become unenforceable.\nA variety of new and existing laws and/or interpretations could materially and adversely affect our business.\nAs detailed in \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation,\u201d we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, data protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, taxation, labor and employment, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) may require us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices.\nThe costs of compliance with these laws and regulation are high and are likely to increase in the future. Additionally, these laws and regulations, or any associated inquiries or investigations or other government actions, may delay or impede the development of new products, result in negative publicity, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nTASER and Axon Devices\nFor our TASER products, we rely on the opinions of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, including the determination that a device that does not expel projectiles by the action of an explosive is not classified as a firearm. Changes in statutes, regulations, and interpretation outside of our control may result in our products being classified or reclassified as firearms. If this were to occur, our private citizen market could be substantially reduced because consumers would be required to comply with federal, state, or local firearm transfer requirements prior to purchasing our products.\nFederal regulation of sales in the U.S.: Our currently offered CEDs are not firearms regulated by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, but our consumer products are regulated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Although there are currently no federal laws restricting sales of our core currently offered CED products in the U.S., future federal regulation could adversely affect sales of our products.\nOur CED products are subject to regulation by testing, safety and other standard organizations. These regulations also affect CEDs with Axon Signal technology, including Signal Performance Power Magazine technology, and TASER 7 battery packs, and could impact future CEDs that feature wireless technology.\nFederal regulation of international sales: Our CEDs are considered a \u201ccrime control\u201d product by the U.S. DOC for export directly from the U.S. which requires us to obtain an export license from the DOC for the export of our CED devices from the U.S. to any country other than Canada. Future products and services may require classifications from the DOC before they may be shipped internationally. Our inability to obtain DOC export licenses or classifications on a timely basis for sales of our products to our international customers could significantly and adversely affect our international sales.\nFederal regulation of foreign national employees: Our intangible CED production is also considered controlled \u201ctechnology\u201d by the U.S. DOC and is categorized as a \u201cdeemed export\u201d for any foreign national employees exposed to the technology within the U.S. Consequently, we must obtain an export licenses from the DOC for any deemed export within the U.S. made to a foreign national employee exposed to the deemed controlled technology. Deemed export licenses are subject to DOC approvals and issued licenses require annual status reports for the stated employees. Inability to obtain proper licensing could curtail the company\u2019s ability to execute R&D and production related to CED technology.\nState and local regulation: Our CEDs are controlled, restricted or, less frequently, prohibited by a number of state and local governments. Other jurisdictions may ban or restrict the sale of our CED products, or restrict their use through changes to use-of-force laws or regulations, and our product sales may be significantly affected by additional state, county and city governmental regulation.\nInternational regulation of foreign imports and sales: Certain jurisdictions prohibit, restrict, or require a permit for the importation, sale, possession or use of CEDs, including in some countries by law enforcement agencies, limiting our international sales opportunities.\nU.S. and International regulation of component movements globally: We rely on a global supply chain of components across our product lines with most final assembly occurring in the U.S. Export of these components from abroad is subject to shifting regulatory landscapes imposed by both the foreign government and U.S. authorities upon import. Abrupt changes to these regulations can result in delays or interruptions to final product supplies.\nInternational regulation of foreign-based operations: We maintain foreign operations in several countries globally for purposes of logistics, sales, and R&D support. Any failure to properly maintain or license could limit our ability to sell, support, or develop our products and services both internationally and in the U.S. market.\nRadio Spectrum Devices\nCertain of our products utilize the radio spectrum to provide wireless voice, data and video communications services. The allocation of spectrum is regulated in the U.S. and other countries and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless services and specifically to public safety users. We manufacture and market products in spectrum bands already made available by regulatory bodies. If current products do not comply with the regulations set forth by these governing bodies, we may be unable to sell our products or could incur penalties. Our results could be negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from time to time by the FCC or regulatory agencies in other countries. Regulatory changes in current spectrum bands may also require modifications to some of our products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed.\nAxon body worn cameras, docks, fleet vehicle cameras and signal devices are subject to FCC\u2019s rules and regulations. These regulations affect CEDs with Signal technology, including the TASER 7, SPPM, and future CEDs implementing wireless technology. Compliance with government regulations could increase our operations and product costs and impact our future financial results.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nWe are subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment, including restricting the presence of certain substances in our products and making us financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of such products. In addition, further environmental legislation may be\nenacted in other jurisdictions, including the U.S. (under federal and state laws) and other countries, the cumulative impact of which could be significant.\nWe endeavor to comply with applicable environmental laws, yet compliance with such laws could increase our operations and product costs, increase the complexities of product design, procurement, and manufacturing, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, limit our sales activities, and impact our future financial results. Any violation of the various environmental regulations can subject us to significant liability, including fines, penalties, and prohibiting sales of our products into one or more states or countries and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nPrivacy Regulations\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. If one or more of the legal mechanisms for transferring data from other countries to the U.S. is invalidated, if we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are prohibited from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results. Additional countries may pass legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and expose us to significant penalties for non-compliance.", "PERMNO": 89031, "SIC": 3480, "TIC": "AAXN"}
