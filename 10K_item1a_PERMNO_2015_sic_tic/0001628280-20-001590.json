{"cik": "1237746", "company": "Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRisk Factors\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected by the following risks or uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but they are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, including overall economic and industry conditions, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. If any of such risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could differ materially from the plans, projections and other forward-looking statements included in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe may not be able to add new subscribers, retain existing subscribers or increase sales to existing subscribers, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur growth is dependent on our ability to continue to attract and acquire new subscribers while retaining existing subscribers and expanding the products and services we sell to them. Growth in the demand for our products and services may be inhibited, and we may be unable to grow our subscriber base, for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour failure to develop or offer new or enhanced products and services in a timely manner that keeps pace with new technologies, competitor offerings, the current industry trend toward comprehensive, integrated web presence and marketing automation solutions, and the evolving needs of our subscribers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties providing or maintaining a high level of subscriber satisfaction, which could cause our existing subscribers to cancel their subscriptions or stop referring prospective subscribers to us;\n\u2022\nincreases in our subscriber churn rates or our failure to convert subscribers from introductory, discounted products to full priced solutions;\n\u2022\nperceived or actual security, availability, integrity, privacy, reliability, quality or compatibility problems with our solutions, including related to unscheduled downtime, outages or network security breaches;\n\u2022\nour inability to maintain awareness of our brands, including due to fragmentation of our marketing efforts due to our historical approach of maintaining a portfolio of multiple brands rather than focusing our resources on a single brand or a few brands;\n\u2022\ncontinued or increased competition in the SMB market, including greater marketing efforts or investments by our competitors in advertising and promoting their brands or in product development;\n\u2022\nchanges in search engine ranking algorithms or in search terms used by potential subscribers; or\n\u2022\nour inability to market our solutions in a cost-effective manner to new subscribers or to our existing subscribers due to changes in regulation, or changes in the enforcement of existing regulation, that would affect our marketing or pricing practices.\nDue to these or other reasons, we may not be able to maintain positive subscriber growth in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe must keep up with rapid and ongoing technological change, marketing trends and shifts in consumer demand to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving industry.\nThe cloud-based technology and online marketing solution industries are characterized by rapid and ongoing technological change, frequent new product and service introductions and new market entrants, and evolving industry standards. Our methods for marketing to our subscribers and potential subscribers must keep pace with technological change, legal requirements, market trends, and shifts in how our solutions are found, purchased and used by subscribers. For example, application marketplaces, mobile platforms, ecommerce tools, voice-activated technology, and greater availability of web presence and email marketing tools from ecommerce, payments and marketing automation companies are changing the way consumers find, purchase and use our solutions. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards and to anticipate subscriber needs and preferences. If we are not able to offer innovative and comprehensive solutions, take advantage of new technology, adapt our marketing practices or anticipate changing trends, we may be unable to continue to attract new subscribers or sell additional solutions to our existing subscribers. In addition, if existing technologies or systems, such as the domain name system that directs traffic on the Internet, become less relevant due to changing technologies, or if we fail to anticipate and manage technologies that harm or reduce consumer demand for our offerings, our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe face significant competition for our solutions in the SMB market, which we expect will continue to intensify. As a result of such competitive pressures, we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position or market share.\nThe SMB market for cloud-based technologies and online marketing tools is highly competitive and constantly evolving. Some of our competitors have greater marketing, engineering, product development and other resources, more brand\nrecognition and consumer awareness, more scalable, more comprehensive or better integrated product offerings, greater international scope or larger subscriber bases than we do, or may partner with large Internet companies that can offer these resources. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully against them. Our competitive position may also be challenged by new market entrants (both new companies and established companies expanding their product offerings or target customers), since there are relatively few barriers to entry in our market.\nWe have faced and expect to continue to face intense competition in our web presence and domain segments, both domestically and internationally, from a number of sources, including the following:\n\u2022\ncompetitors in the domain, hosting and website builder markets such as GoDaddy, Ionos by 1&1, Wix, Squarespace, Weebly (now owned by Square), and Web.com;\n\u2022\nWordpress.com and Wordpress-focused hosting companies such as WPEngine and SiteGround;\n\u2022\ne-commerce, payments, email marketing, and marketing automation companies that are expanding their offerings to include website builders or other web presence offerings;\n\u2022\ncloud hosting providers; and\n\u2022\nlarge companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google, which offer web hosting or website builders, domain registration and other cloud-based services, and Facebook, which offers an Internet marketing platform.\nFor our email marketing segment, we expect continued competition from MailChimp and other SMB-focused email marketing vendors, as well as additional competition from providers of marketing automation software and web presence competitors who are expanding their offerings to include email marketing functionality.\nCompetitors in each of our segments are expanding their offerings into adjacent products and services in order to provide a more comprehensive set of business solutions for SMBs. In some cases, companies that previously competed with us in one of our segments are now competing with us in most or all of them, as email marketing providers begin to offer website builders, and vice versa. In addition, marketing automation, ecommerce, payments and other online services companies that have not competed with us in the past are expanding into our market by providing website builder and email marketing tools, and by enhancing offerings tailored for SMBs. As a result of these changes, SMBs now have a broader range of \u201centry points\u201d for establishing an online presence, and may choose to do so through an e-commerce, payments, or marketing solutions provider that provides a website builder, hosting or email marketing as part of a \u201cbundled\u201d solution, rather than starting with a domain name or hosting account.\nIn addition, our competitors have and may continue to offer price discounts or alternative pricing models for the products and services they offer, such as \"freemium\" pricing in which a basic offering is provided for free with advanced features provided for a fee. Some of our competitors have used the freemium model successfully to drive both free and paid subscriber growth. Although we do have freemium offerings, they are not extensive, which could put us at a disadvantage relative to these competitors with respect to subscriber growth. In addition, we sometimes need to match our competitors' discounts or the commissions they pay to referral sources in order for our products to remain competitive, which could reduce our margins.\nOur business and operations are complex due to our history of acquisitions and organizational change, which has and may continue to result in operational and other challenges.\nAs a result of acquisitions and internal growth, we increased our revenue from $741.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to $1.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2019. During this time period, we completed numerous acquisitions, including the acquisition of the Directi web presence business in January 2014, which expanded our international operations, and the acquisition of Constant Contact in February 2016.\nDue to our history of acquisitions, we offer our products and services through numerous brands that operate from different websites, control panels, billing systems, information technology and other systems. As a result, compliance assessments, compliance-related changes, roll-outs of new products and platform, product and technology upgrades, and changes in business processes often need to be implemented more than once. This level of complexity has sometimes resulted and may continue to result in difficulties maintaining effective internal controls, reliance on manual controls, challenges in maintaining and upgrading our technology platforms, additional compliance costs and risks, product roll-out inefficiencies, and other operational challenges.\nIn particular, differences across our multiple billing systems have at times made it challenging for us to accurately and consistently determine certain enterprise-wide operational metrics, such as total subscribers. Total subscribers and other operational metrics, which we voluntarily disclose, historically have not been subject to the same level of reporting controls as our financial statements and other financial information we are required to disclose. Also, we have identified in the past, and may in the future identify, errors or bugs in the systems we use to generate operational metrics. We work on an ongoing basis to improve our controls and processes for total subscribers and other operational metrics, but errors and inconsistencies with respect to these metrics could still occur, which could negatively impact our business decisions and lead to inaccurate disclosures.\nIn addition, as a public company, we are required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to maintain, evaluate, test and document internal controls over financial reporting, and our multiple brands and systems make this process more complicated and costly than it would be otherwise. Any failure in the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse impact on our ability to report our financial statements and/or key financial metrics in an accurate and timely manner and undermine investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, key financial metrics, or other public disclosures. Inaccurate and/or untimely financial statements or other disclosures could also subject us to regulatory actions, civil or criminal penalties or stockholder litigation.\nOur growth may be adversely affected if we cannot continue to successfully attract, retain and motivate key employees.\nOur ability to successfully pursue our growth strategy depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees across our business, particularly engineering and development employees and our senior executive team. High demand from other technology companies for skilled engineering and technical employees has made and may continue to make it challenging to retain key employees or hire replacements if they leave. In addition, candidates making employment decisions, particularly in high-technology industries, often consider the value of any equity they may receive from prospective employers. As a result, volatility or poor performance in the market price of our common stock, or concerns by potential or current employees about the performance of our stock, has and may continue to contribute to hiring and retention challenges.\nWe are also limited in our ability to recruit global talent for our U.S. offices by U.S. immigration laws. Work visa restrictions in the U.S. have become tighter in recent years, making it more difficult to source qualified personnel from other countries, and changes in U.S. immigration policies under the current presidential administration may further limit our ability to recruit globally.\nOur current executives are not contractually obligated to remain employed by us and may leave at any time. The loss of any of these individuals could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of, or make it more difficult for us to pursue and execute on, our business objectives.\nOur inability to attract and retain qualified individuals could have an adverse effect on our ability to carry out our business plans and objectives and, as a result, our ability to compete could decrease and our operating results could suffer.\nWe have experienced system, software, Internet, data center, network, and customer support center failures in the past. We do not yet have a disaster recovery plan that covers all of our brands, and we do not yet have a complete business continuity program. Any interruptions, delays or failures in our services could harm our reputation, cause us to lose subscribers, or result in unanticipated costs.\nWe must be able to maintain and operate our applications and systems without interruption. Since our ability to retain and attract subscribers depends on the performance, reliability and availability of our services, as well as on the delivery of our products and services to subscribers, even minor interruptions in our service or losses of data could harm our reputation, particularly if they frequently reoccur. Our applications, network, systems, equipment, power supplies, customer support centers and data centers are subject to various points of failure, including: human error or accidents; improper maintenance and change control; Internet connectivity downtime or disruptions in connectivity between and among systems; computer viruses; physical or electronic security breaches; inadequate systems monitoring; intentional bad acts such as sabotage, hacking, ransomware, vandalism or terrorism; pandemics; and natural disasters.\nWe have experienced system failures, delays and periodic interruptions in service, or outages, due to factors such as power outages and network equipment, storage system, and network configuration failures. In addition, we have experienced outages or other disruptions in the course of ongoing maintenance or when new versions, enhancements and updates to applications, software or systems are released by us or third parties. We may experience future outages that disrupt the operation of our solutions due to these or other factors.\nOur systems supporting our web presence and domain segments are not fully redundant. In 2019, we built out and tested additional redundancies for a significant portion of our hosting subscribers, but we have not yet implemented equivalent redundancies across all of our web presence and domain brands. Although the redundancies we do have in place will permit us to respond, at least to some degree, to failures of applications and systems, our data centers are vulnerable in the event of failure. Most of our web presence subscribers, and a significant portion of our domain subscribers, are hosted across five U.S.-based data centers, one of which is owned by us and the rest of which are co-located, and accordingly, any failure or downtime in these data center facilities would affect a significant percentage of our subscribers. While we have a disaster recovery system that covers most of our email marketing subscribers, it is nonetheless likely to be difficult and time-consuming to recover data and services in the event of a significant outage. We do not yet have adequate structures or systems in place to recover from a data center\u2019s severe impairment or total destruction, and recovery from the total destruction or severe impairment of any of our major data centers would be extremely difficult and may not be possible at all. Closing any of these data centers without adequate notice could result in lengthy, if not permanent, interruptions in the availability of our solutions and loss of vast amounts of subscriber data.\nOur data centers are also susceptible to impairment resulting from electrical power outages due to the amount of power and cooling they require to operate. Since we rely on third parties to provide our data centers with power sufficient to meet our needs, we cannot control whether our data centers will have an adequate amount of electrical resources necessary to meet our subscriber requirements. We attempt to limit exposure to system downtime due to power outages by using backup generators and power supplies. However, these protections may not limit our exposure to power shortages or outages entirely. We also rely on third parties to provide Internet connectivity to our data centers. If the connectivity these parties provide is discontinued, disrupted, or does not provide adequate data transmission capacity, our ability to provide services to our subscribers could be compromised.\nOur customer support centers are also vulnerable in the event of failure caused by total destruction or severe impairment. The teams in each customer support center are trained to provide brand-specific support services for a discrete subset of our brands, which, along with staffing constraints and differences in software systems between our brands, limits our ability to effectively re-route calls, email and chat from one customer support center to another customer support center. Accordingly, if any of our customer support centers were to be impaired or destroyed, our ability to re-route calls, email and chat to operational customer support centers or to provide the type of customer support services that the non-operational customer support center had provided to subscribers of a particular brand or brands may be limited.\nAny of these events could materially increase our expenses or reduce our revenue, damage our reputation, cause our subscribers to seek reimbursement for services paid for and not received, cause our subscribers to stop referring new subscribers to us, and cause us to lose current and potential subscribers, which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, the cyber, property and business interruption insurance we carry may not have adequate coverage to compensate us fully for losses that may occur.\nIf we are unable to achieve or maintain a high level of subscriber satisfaction, demand for our solutions could suffer.\nWe believe that our future revenue growth depends on our ability to provide subscribers with quality service that meets our stated commitments, meets or exceeds our subscribers\u2019 evolving needs and expectations and is conducive to our ability to continue to sell new solutions to existing subscribers. We are not always able to provide our subscribers with this level of service, and our subscribers occasionally encounter interruptions in service and other challenges, including as a result of outages, errors or bugs in our software or third-party software, human error, or migrations of subscribers as part of internal platform consolidation efforts. If we are unable to achieve or maintain a high level of subscriber satisfaction, we could experience higher subscriber churn, lower than expected renewal rates, disputes and litigation, or negative publicity, any of which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, we may from time to time fail to meet the needs of specific subscribers in order to best meet the service expectations of our overall subscriber base. For example, we may suspend a subscriber\u2019s website when it breaches our terms of service, harms other subscribers\u2019 websites or disrupts servers supporting those websites, such as when a cybercriminal installs malware on a subscriber\u2019s website without that subscriber\u2019s authorization or knowledge. Although such service interruptions are not uncommon in a cloud-based or online environment, we risk subscriber dissatisfaction by interrupting one subscriber\u2019s service to prevent further attacks on or data breaches for other subscribers, and this could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business.\nSecurity incidents, privacy breaches or fraud may harm our business.\nWe collect, handle, store and transmit large amounts of sensitive, confidential, personal and proprietary information, including payment card information and information we receive from or maintain on behalf of our subscribers. Unauthorized access to, use of, or loss of this type of information and any compromise of our networks, systems, or applications may cause damage to our platforms, service interruptions to our subscribers, loss of subscriber websites and data, or harm to our reputation and may result in increased security costs, distraction of our management team, litigation, regulatory investigations or other direct or indirect expense or liabilities. These types of incidents can result from numerous sources, including: physical or electronic security breaches; viruses, ransomware or other malware; hardware vulnerabilities; accident or human error by our own personnel or those of our partners; criminal activity or malfeasance (including by our own personnel); fraud or impersonation scams perpetrated against us; or security events impacting our third-party service providers. We have experienced security events such as these in the past and expect they will continue in the future. To date, we do not believe that any of these events has had a material effect on us, but we may experience larger and more serious incidents in the future.\nIn addition, many states and countries in which we have subscribers have enacted regulations requiring us to notify governmental authorities, regulators and subscribers in the event that certain systems are compromised, or subscriber information is accessed or acquired (or believed to have been accessed or acquired) without authorization, and in some cases also develop proscriptive policies to protect against such unauthorized access or acquisition. Such notifications can result in private causes of action being filed against us, or government investigations into the adequacy of security controls or handling of any security event. Should we experience a loss of protected data or a disruption in the availability or integrity of our\nservices or data we store for subscribers, efforts to respond to the incident and enhance our controls, as well as potential penalties imposed by regulators or damages awarded to private plaintiffs, could increase our costs.\nOrganizations generally, and Internet-based organizations in particular, are vulnerable to targeted attacks aimed at exploiting network and system applications or weaknesses, causing damage or disruption, or obtaining ransom payments. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, networks and systems often are not recognized until launched against a target. Cyber criminals use advanced and quickly-evolving tactics, including evasive applications, proxies, tunneling, encryption techniques, vulnerability exploits, buffer overflows, distributed denial of service attacks, or DDoS attacks, and botnets. For example, from time to time we are targeted by DDoS attacks in which attackers attempt to block access to our websites or our subscribers' websites, as well as attempts to place illegal or abusive content on our or our subscribers' websites. If we are unable to avert a DDoS or other attack for any significant period, we could sustain substantial revenue loss from lost sales and subscriber dissatisfaction.\nCyber-attacks may target us, our subscribers, our partners, banks, credit card processors, delivery services, e-commerce in general or the communication infrastructure on which we depend. As security threats evolve and become more sophisticated and more difficult to detect and defend against, a hacker or thief may defeat our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, partners, or vendors, and obtain confidential or personal information. We or the third party may not discover the security breach and theft of information for a significant period of time after the breach occurs. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches and thefts of data or to address problems caused by breaches or thefts, and we may not be able to, or may fail to, anticipate cyber-attacks or implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, we rely on third parties to provide physical security for our facilities, including data centers. Any physical breach of security could result in unauthorized access or damage to our systems.\nOur employees, including our employee and contract support agents are often targeted by, and may be vulnerable to a variety of social engineering attacks, such as e-mail scams, phishing, and/or similar attack tactics used to perpetrate fraud. We have experienced and may in the future experience security attacks that cause our support agents to divulge confidential information about us or our subscribers, or to introduce viruses, worms or other malicious software programs onto their computers, allowing the perpetrators to, among other things, gain access to our systems or our subscribers\u2019 accounts. Our subscribers have in the past, and may in the future, use weak passwords, accidentally disclose their passwords or store them on a mobile device that is lost or stolen, or otherwise compromise or fail to ensure the security of their data, creating the perception that our systems are not secure against third-party access when their accounts are compromised and used maliciously by third parties. In addition, if third parties with which we work, such as vendors, partners or developers, violate applicable laws or our policies or disclose our confidential information due to human error or technical issues, such violations or incidents may also put our information and our subscribers\u2019 information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nIf an actual or perceived security breach occurs, the market\u2019s perception of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and current and potential subscribers. In addition, in the past, security specialists or \"white hat\" hackers have found and publicized security vulnerabilities in our platforms, and this may occur again in the future. This type of publicity could harm our reputation, even if we correct the vulnerabilities before they have actually been exploited. We might also be required to expend significant capital and resources to investigate, protect against or address breaches and remediate vulnerabilities. Any significant violations of data security could result in the loss of business, litigation and regulatory investigations and penalties that could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, if a high profile security breach occurs with respect to another provider of cloud-based technologies or online marketing tools, our subscribers and potential subscribers may lose trust in the security of these business models generally, which could harm our ability to retain existing subscribers or attract new ones. We cannot guarantee that any backup systems, regular data backups, security protocols, network protection mechanisms and other procedures currently in place, or that may be in place in the future, will be adequate to prevent network and service interruption, system failure, damage to one or more of our systems or data loss in the event of a security breach or attack on our network.\nIf we do not maintain a low rate of credit card chargebacks, protect against breach of the credit card information we store and comply with payment card industry standards, we will face the prospect of financial penalties and could lose our ability to accept credit card payments from subscribers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nA majority of our revenue is processed through credit card transactions. Under current credit card industry practices, we are liable for fraudulent and disputed credit card transactions because we do not obtain the cardholder\u2019s signature at the time of the transaction, even though the financial institution issuing the credit card may have authorized the transaction. Although we attempt to keep our rate of credit card refunds and chargebacks low, our credit card processors have in the past and could in the future impose fines on us as a result of increased refunds and chargebacks. In addition, if our refunds or chargebacks increase in the future, our credit card processors could require us to maintain or increase reserves, increase our processing fees, terminate\ntheir contracts with us or decline to serve as credit card processors for new joint ventures or brands, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe could also incur significant fines or lose our ability to process payments using credit cards if we fail to follow payment card industry data security standards, or PCI DSS, even if there is no compromise of subscriber information. In the past, we have identified control gaps in our adherence to PCI DSS in certain of our brands, and any failure to achieve or maintain compliance with PCI DSS across our various brands could have negative consequences. In this event, we may incur financial penalties, our payment networks may increase the processing fees they charge to us, or we may lose our ability to process credit cards, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, we may have difficulty negotiating competitive rates with payment networks for as long as the noncompliance persists.\nFrom time to time, fraudulent transactions conducted on our websites (such as through the use of stolen credit card numbers) have been above levels consistent with credit card association guidelines. This has sometimes resulted, and may in the future result, in third-party audit requirements and additional expense to change our processes to reduce fraud. It could also subject us to liability or require us to increase reserves with our credit card processors. Under credit card association rules, penalties may be imposed at the discretion of the association. Any such potential penalties would be imposed on our credit card processors by the credit card association. Under our contracts with our credit card processors, we are required to reimburse the credit card processors for such penalties. Although we believe that our current level of fraud monitoring is adequate, we face the risk that we may fail to maintain an adequate level of fraud monitoring in the future, or that one or more credit card associations may, at any time, assess penalties against us or terminate our ability to accept credit card payments from subscribers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, we could be liable if there is a breach of the credit card or other payment information we store. Online commerce and communications depend on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. We rely on encryption and authentication technology that we have developed internally, as well as technology that we license from third parties, to provide security and authentication for the transmission of confidential information, including subscriber credit card numbers. However, we cannot ensure that this technology can prevent breaches of the systems that we use to protect subscriber credit card data. Although we maintain network security insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will cover, in whole or in part, liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, some of our third-party partners also collect information from transactions with our customers, and we may be subject to litigation or our reputation may be harmed if our partners fail to protect our subscribers\u2019 information or if they use it in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices.\nData breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues. Under our contracts with our card processors, if there is unauthorized access to, or disclosure of, credit card information that we store, we could be liable to the credit card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may be adversely affected due to a variety of factors, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below investor or analyst expectations.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results and key metrics have varied from period to period in the past, and we expect they may continue to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, a number of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to cost-effectively attract, retain, and increase sales to subscribers;\n\u2022\nthe impact of competition;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of introductions of new products or product enhancements;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of our marketing expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of capital expenditures or extraordinary expenses, such as litigation, regulatory or other dispute-related settlement payments;\n\u2022\nthe mix of products we sell;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected refunds to our subscribers;\n\u2022\nsystems, data center and Internet failures, breaches and service interruptions;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity about us or our brands;\n\u2022\nloss of key employees or difficulties recruiting new employees;\n\u2022\nthe impact of changes in legislation or regulations, or to interpretations of existing legislation and regulations;\n\u2022\nlitigation or governmental enforcement actions against us due to actual or alleged failures to comply with applicable laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nfailures to comply with industry standards such as the payment card industry data security standards;\n\u2022\nchanges in our effective tax rate, our misinterpretation of domestic and international tax laws and regulations, or adverse outcomes from regulatory examinations of our income tax and other tax returns;\n\u2022\ninterest rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\ngoodwill and other intangible asset impairments;\n\u2022\nterminations of, disputes with, or material changes to our relationships with third-party partners; and\n\u2022\ncosts, integration problems, or other liabilities associated with past or future acquisitions, strategic investments or joint ventures.\nOur financial or operating results in future reporting periods may fall below the expectations of the public market, investors, or analysts due to one or more of the factors above or for other reasons, which could cause our stock price to decline substantially.\nOur business depends on establishing and maintaining strong brands. If we are not able to effectively promote our brands, or if the reputation of our brands is damaged, our ability to expand our subscriber base will be impaired and our business and operating results will be harmed.\nWe market our solutions through various brands, including our key brands Bluehost, HostGator, Domain.com, and Constant Contact.\nWe believe that establishing and maintaining our key brands is critical to our efforts to expand our subscriber base. If we do not build awareness of our key brands, we could be at a competitive disadvantage to companies whose brands are, or become, more recognizable than ours. For instance, we believe that our business has been, and may continue to be, affected by the increasing tendency of consumers to search for web presence and online marketing solutions using brand related search terms as opposed to unbranded search terms such as hosting, website builders or email marketing. We believe this trend has benefited competitors who have invested more heavily than we have in building brand awareness, and who have used a broader array of marketing channels to do so, in contrast to our historical focus on marketing through online advertising, online directories, and referral partners.\nTo attract and retain subscribers and to promote and maintain our brands in response to competitive pressures, we may have to substantially increase our financial commitment to creating and maintaining brand loyalty among subscribers. Improving our brand awareness may be challenging because we have multiple key brands rather than a single flagship brand, and because a number of our competitors have invested heavily in their brands in the past and may be able to devote more resources than we can to brand awareness going forward.\nIn addition, if subscribers, as well as our third-party referral marketing, distribution and reseller partners, do not perceive our existing solutions to be reliable and of high quality, if we introduce new services or enter into new business ventures that are not favorably received by such parties, or if our brands become associated with any fraudulent or deceptive conduct on the part of our subscribers, the value of our brands could be diminished, thereby decreasing the attractiveness of our solutions to such parties. As a result, our operating results may be adversely affected by decreased brand recognition and harm to our reputation.\nThe rate of growth of the SMB market for our solutions could be significantly lower than our estimates. The success of our products depends on the expansion and reliability of the Internet infrastructure and the continued growth and acceptance of email as a communications tool. If demand for our products and services does not meet expectations, our ability to generate revenue and meet our financial targets could be adversely affected.\nThe rate of growth of the SMB market may not meet our expectations, which would adversely affect our business. Our expectations for future revenue trends are based in part on assumptions reflecting our industry knowledge and experience serving SMBs, as well as our assumptions regarding demographic shifts, growth in the Internet infrastructure internationally and macroeconomic conditions. However, SMB spending patterns are difficult to predict and are sensitive to the general economic climate, the economic outlook specific to SMBs and overall consumer confidence, which makes it difficult to forecast market trends accurately. If any of our assumptions regarding the SMB market proves to be inaccurate, our revenue could be significantly lower than expected.\nOur ability to compete depends on our ability to offer products and services that enable our subscribers to establish, manage and grow their businesses. Our web presence and commerce offerings are predicated on the assumption that an online presence will continue to be an important factor in our subscribers\u2019 abilities to establish, expand, manage and monetize their businesses affordably. If we are incorrect in this assumption, for example due to the introduction of a new technology or industry standard (or evolution of existing technology such as social media or voice assistant software) that supersedes the importance of an online presence or renders our existing or future solutions obsolete, then our ability to retain existing subscribers and attract new subscribers could be adversely affected, which could harm our ability to generate revenue and meet our financial targets.\nThe future success of our email marketing solution depends on the continued widespread use of email as a primary means of communication. Security problems such as viruses, worms, and other malicious programs, reliability issues arising from outages and damage to the Internet infrastructure, or publicity about leaked emails of high-profile users could create the perception that email is not a safe and reliable means of communication. Use of email by businesses and consumers also depends on the ability of email providers to prevent unsolicited bulk email, or \u201cspam,\u201d from overwhelming consumers\u2019\ninboxes. If security problems become widespread or frequent or if email providers cannot effectively control spam, the use of email as a means of communication may decline as consumers find alternative ways to communicate. We could also be harmed if, in an attempt to limit unsolicited email, email providers restrict or limit emails sent by our customers using our email marketing solution. In addition, if alternative communications tools, such as social media, or ephemeral or text messaging, continue to gain widespread acceptance, the need for email may decrease. Any of these events could materially increase our expenses or reduce demand for our email marketing solution and harm our business.\nOur success depends in part on our strategic relationships and partnerships or other alliances with third parties.\nWe rely on third-party relationships and alliances, such as with referrers and promoters of our brands and solutions, as well as with our providers of solutions and services that we offer to subscribers. If any of the third parties on which we rely fails to perform as expected, breaches or terminates their agreement with us, or becomes engaged in a dispute with us, our reputation could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed.\nWe rely on third-party referral partners and other marketing partners to acquire subscribers. If these partners fail to promote our brands or to refer new subscribers to us, begin promoting competing brands in addition to or instead of ours, fail to comply with regulations, are forced to change their marketing practices in response to new or existing regulations or cease to be viewed as credible sources of information by our potential subscribers, we may face decreased demand for our solutions, higher than expected subscriber acquisition costs, and loss of revenue. For instance, in the past, we were impacted when an important referral source began featuring competing web hosting brands on their website, rather than just our brand. It is possible that in the future, this referral source or another, similar referral source will continue to add competing web hosting options or even remove us as an option, which could have a negative impact on us.\nOur ability to offer domain name services to our subscribers depends on certain third-party relationships. For example, certain of our subsidiaries are accredited by ICANN and various domain name registries as a domain name registrar. If we fail to comply with domain name registry requirements, or if domain name registry requirements change, we could lose our accreditation, be required to increase our expenditures, comply with additional requirements or alter our service offerings, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the requirements of ICANN and other domain registries are not consistent with some aspects of the GDPR or other privacy laws, which could make compliance with these requirements infeasible or more costly and complicated than they would be otherwise.\nWe rely on software licensed from or hosted by third parties to offer certain of our solutions to our subscribers. We also have relationships with product partners whose solutions, including shopping carts and security tools, we integrate with our products and offer to our subscribers. In our web presence segment, we use third party web hosting control panels, which allow our hosting customers to manage their websites, for several of our strategic brands. In our email marketing segment, we rely on some of our partners to create integrations with third-party applications and platforms used by our subscribers. We may be unable to continue our relationship with any of these partners or third parties if, for example, they decline to continue to work with us or are acquired. In such an event, we may not be able to continue to offer these third-party tools to our subscribers or we may be forced to find an alternative that may be inferior to or more costly than the solution that we had previously offered. We currently face, and expect to face from time to time in the future, pricing or other disputes with our third party partners and licensors, which may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs and/or costs to our customers. Although the results of any such disputes, whether current or future, cannot be predicted with certainty, the final outcome could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operations.\nWe may also need to obtain future licenses from third parties to use intellectual property associated with the development of our solutions, which might not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any software or other intellectual property required for the development and maintenance of our solutions could result in delays in the provision of our solutions until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, which could harm our business and operating results.\nThe international nature of our business exposes us to business risks that could limit the effectiveness of our growth strategy and cause our operating results to suffer.\nWe currently maintain offices and workforces, and conduct operations, primarily in the United States, Brazil, India and the Netherlands and have third-party support arrangements in India, the Philippines and China. Conducting operations in international markets or establishing international locations subjects us to challenges that we have not generally faced in the United States, including:\n\u2022\nadapting our solutions and marketing practices to international markets, including translation into foreign languages;\n\u2022\ncompliance with foreign laws, including more stringent laws in foreign jurisdictions relating to consumer privacy and protection, collection and use of data obtained from individuals and other third parties;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting payments from subscribers or in automatically renewing their contracts with us, especially due to the more limited availability and popularity of credit cards in certain countries;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in enforcing contracts, including our terms of service and other agreements;\n\u2022\nmanagement, communication, compliance and integration problems resulting from cultural or language differences and geographic dispersion;\n\u2022\nsufficiency of qualified labor pools and greater influence of organized labor in various international markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance by our employees, business partners and other agents with anti-bribery laws (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in India, Brazil and other jurisdictions where we do business), economic sanction laws and regulations, export controls, and other U.S., foreign and local laws and regulations regarding international and multi-national business operations;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax (or sales, service, use or other tax) systems, and our failure to comply with all relevant foreign tax rules and regulations due to our lack of familiarity with the jurisdiction\u2019s tax laws or unexpected or aggressive tax positions taken by foreign tax authorities;\n\u2022\nrestrictions and withholdings on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange risk;\n\u2022\nuncertain political, regulatory and economic climates in some countries, which could result in unpredictable or frequent changes in applicable regulations or in the general business environment that could negatively impact us; and\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nIn addition, our ability to expand internationally and attract and retain non-U.S. subscribers may be adversely affected by concerns about the extent to which U.S. governmental and law enforcement agencies may obtain data about our subscribers, and by privacy laws in other jurisdictions (such as the GDPR) that are generally more protective of subscriber data than U.S. law. Non-U.S. subscribers may decide that the privacy risks of storing data with a U.S.-based company outweigh the benefits and opt to seek solutions from a company based outside of the United States. In addition, certain foreign governments require local storage of their citizens\u2019 data. If we become subject to such requirements, it may require us to increase the number of non-U.S. data centers or servers we maintain, increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to attract, retain or cost-effectively serve non-U.S. subscribers.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic investments may not achieve the intended benefits or may disrupt our current plans and operations.\nAcquisitions have historically been an important component of our growth strategy. We have acquired the businesses and assets of numerous other companies, including the acquisition of Constant Contact in February 2016. We have also made strategic investments in and entered into joint ventures with third parties, typically with small companies focused on developing or marketing products that may complement our own. We may complete transactions of this type in the future. These transactions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in integrating the acquired businesses, which could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions;\n\u2022\nreliance on third parties for transition services prior to subscriber migration;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in supporting and migrating acquired subscribers, if any, to our platforms, which could cause subscriber churn, unanticipated costs, and damage to our reputation;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing business and diversion of management and other resources from existing operations;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of additional debt or the issuance of equity securities, resulting in dilution to existing stockholders, in order to fund an acquisition;\n\u2022\nassumption of debt or other actual or contingent liabilities of the acquired company, including litigation risk;\n\u2022\ndifferences in corporate culture, compliance protocols, and risk management practices between us and acquired companies;\n\u2022\npotential loss of the key employees of an acquired business;\n\u2022\npotential loss of the subscribers or partners of an acquired business due to the actual or perceived impact of the acquisition;\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with governance, management and control matters in majority or minority investments or joint ventures;\n\u2022\nunforeseen or undisclosed liabilities or challenges associated with the companies, businesses or technologies we acquire;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences, including exposure of our entire business to taxation in additional jurisdictions; and\n\u2022\naccounting effects, including potential impairment charges and requirements that we record deferred revenue at fair value.\nAny of these risks could result in our acquisitions disrupting our business and/or failing to achieve their intended objectives.\nWe have a history of losses and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe had a net loss in each year since inception through 2017. Although we reported net income for fiscal year 2018, we reported a net loss for fiscal year 2019 and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future. We had a net loss attributable to Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc. of $107.3 million for fiscal year 2017, net income of $4.5 million for fiscal year 2018, and net loss of $12.3 million for fiscal year 2019.\nWe have made and expect to continue to make significant expenditures to maintain, develop, improve and expand our business, and we may not be able to maintain profitability in light of our expenditure levels. We may incur significant losses in the future if we are unable to increase subscriber and revenue growth to cover these expenditures or for a number of other reasons, including interest expense related to our substantial indebtedness, amortization expense associated with past or potential future acquisitions, and the other risks described in this report.\nWe are a multinational organization faced with increasingly complex tax issues in many jurisdictions, and if our tax positions are examined by tax authorities, we could be obligated to pay additional taxes in various jurisdictions.\nAs a multinational organization with a digital and Internet-based business, we may be subject to direct and indirect taxation in multiple jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we collect or pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially with changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operating results.\nGovernments are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues, which has contributed to an increase in audit activity and more aggressive positions taken by tax authorities. Any additional taxes or other assessments by tax authorities may be in excess of our current tax provisions or may require us to modify our business practices in order to reduce our exposure to additional taxes going forward, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDue to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that various states or foreign countries might attempt to levy additional or new sales, income or other taxes relating to our activities. Tax authorities at the international, federal, state and local levels are currently reviewing the appropriate treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce. Changes in tax laws, such as tax reform in the United States or changes in tax laws resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting, could impact our effective tax rate.\nWe may need additional equity, debt or other financing in the future, which we may not be able to obtain on acceptable terms, or at all, and any additional financing may result in restrictions on our operations or substantial dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may need to raise funds in the future, for example, to develop new technologies, expand our business, respond to competitive pressures, acquire businesses, or respond to unanticipated situations. Our ability to obtain debt or equity funding will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, interest rates, our operating performance, and investor interest. In addition, incurring additional debt may not be permitted under our credit agreement or indenture governing our 10.875% senior notes due 2024 (which we refer to as the \"Senior Notes\"), or may require lender or noteholder consent. As such, additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nIf adequate funds are not available, we may be required to reduce expenditures, including curtailing our growth strategies, foregoing acquisitions or reducing our product development efforts. If we succeed in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, then the issuance could result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, these new securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock. In addition, any preferred equity issuance or debt financing that we may obtain in the future could have restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. To the extent any such new indebtedness is secured and is at higher interest rates than on our existing first lien term loan facility, the interest rates on our existing first lien term loan facility could increase as a result of the \u201cmost-favored nation\u201d pricing provision in our existing credit agreement. Further, to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations, the risks associated with our substantial leverage described elsewhere in this report, including our possible inability to service our debt, would increase.\nWe rely on data centers to deliver our services. If we are unable to renew our data center agreements on favorable terms, or at all, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, our ownership of our largest data center subjects us to potential costs and risks associated with real property ownership.\nWe currently serve most of our subscribers from six data center facilities located in Massachusetts (three), Texas (two), and Utah (one). We own the Utah data center and occupy the remaining data centers pursuant to co-location service agreements with third-party data center facilities which have built and maintain the co-located data centers for us and other parties. Although we own the servers in these data centers and engineer and architect the systems upon which our platforms run, we do not control the operation of the facilities we do not own.\nThe terms of our existing co-located data center agreements vary in length and expire on various dates through 2026. The owners of these or our other co-located data centers have no obligation to continue such arrangements beyond their current terms, nor are they obligated to renew their agreements with us on terms acceptable to us, or at all. These agreements may not provide us with adequate time to transfer operations to a new facility in the event of early termination. If we were required to move our equipment to a new facility without adequate time to plan and prepare for such migration, we would face significant challenges due to the technical complexity, risk and high costs of the relocation. Any such migration could result in downtime or other disruptions to our services, which could damage our reputation, cause subscriber losses and harm our operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are able to renew the agreements on our existing co-located data center facilities, the lease rates may be higher than those we pay under our existing agreements. In addition, the complexities and risks of data center migrations, even when we have adequate time to plan for them, can sometimes make it impractical to leave our current data center facilities, even when we may be able to obtain economic or other terms with a new data center provider that would be better for us over the long term. If we fail to increase our revenue by amounts sufficient to offset any increases in lease rates for our existing data center facilities, or cannot take advantage of potentially better terms with new data center providers because of migration challenges, our operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nWith respect to the data center facility that we own, we are subject to risks, and may incur significant costs, related to our ownership of the facility and the land on which it is located, including costs or risks related to building repairs or upgrades and compliance with various federal, state and local laws applicable to real property owners, including environmental laws.\nIf our solutions and software contain serious errors or defects, or if human error on our part results in damage to our subscribers\u2019 businesses, then we may lose revenue and market acceptance and may incur costs to defend or settle claims.\nComplex technology platforms, software applications and systems such as ours often contain errors or defects, such as errors in computer code, vulnerabilities or other systems errors, particularly when first introduced or when new versions, enhancements or updates are released. Because we also rely on third parties to develop many of our solutions, our products and services may contain additional errors or defects as a result of the integration of the third party\u2019s product. Despite quality assurance measures, internal testing and beta testing by our subscribers, we cannot guarantee that our current and future solutions will be free of serious defects, which could result in lost revenue or a delay in market acceptance. Such errors in computer code, vulnerabilities or other system errors have in the past and may in the future result in performance issues, loss of data, loss or fraudulent transfers of customer domain names, data breaches, malware outbreaks, DDoS attacks staged by using our resources, and other issues. To date, we do not believe that any of these errors has had a material effect on us, but we may experience larger and more serious incidents in the future.\nSince our subscribers use our solutions to, among other things, maintain an online presence for their business, it is not uncommon for subscribers to allege that errors, defects, or other performance problems result in damage to their businesses. They could elect to cancel or not to renew their agreements, delay or withhold payments to us, or bring claims or file suit seeking significant compensation from us for the losses they or their businesses allege to have suffered. For instance, from time to time, we have inadvertently deleted subscriber data due to human error, technical problems or miscommunication with customers. These lost data cases have sometimes led to subscribers commencing litigation against us, settlement payments to subscribers, subscription cancellations, and negative social media attention. Although our subscriber agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to specified claims, including data loss claims, existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate or diminish these limitations. Even if not successful, defending against claims brought against us can be time-consuming and costly and could seriously damage our reputation in the marketplace, making it harder for us to acquire and retain subscribers.\nBecause we are required to recognize revenue for our subscription-based services over the term of the applicable subscriber agreement, changes in our sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. In addition, we may not have adequate reserves in the event that our historical levels of refunds increase, which could adversely affect our liquidity and profitability.\nWe recognize revenue from our subscribers ratably over the respective terms of their agreements with us in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These contracts are generally for service periods of up to 36 months. Accordingly, increases in sales during a particular period do not translate into corresponding increases in revenue during that same period, and a substantial portion of the revenue that we recognize during a quarter is derived from deferred revenue from our agreements with subscribers that we entered into during previous quarters. As a result, we may not generate net earnings despite substantial sales activity during a particular period. Conversely, the existence of substantial deferred revenue may prevent deteriorating sales activity from becoming immediately apparent in our reported operating results.\nIn connection with our domain registration services, as a registrar, we are required under our agreements with domain registries to prepay the domain registry for the term for which a domain is registered. We recognize this prepayment as an asset on our consolidated balance sheet and record domain revenue and the domain registration expense ratably over the term that a domain is registered. This cash payment to the domain registry may lead to fluctuations in our liquidity that are not immediately reflected in our operating results.\nIn addition, our standard terms of service permit our subscribers to seek refunds from us in certain instances, and we maintain reserves to provide such refunds. The amount of such reserves is based on the amount of refunds that we have provided in the past. If our actual level of refund claims exceeds our estimates and our refund reserves are not adequate to cover such claims, our liquidity or profitability could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if we experience an unexpected decline in our revenue, we may not be able to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for such shortfall, and any significant shortfall in revenue relative to planned expenditures could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations, including those described in Part I, Item 1, Business under the heading \u201cLaws and Regulations.\u201d Our actual or perceived failure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our business, and new or modified laws or regulations could reduce demand for our products or require us to change our products, our operations or our marketing, market research and advertising practices in ways that negatively affect us.\nAny failure by us to comply with applicable laws or regulations, including (among others) those described in Part I, Item 1, Business may result in a range of negative consequences, including: regulatory investigations; governmental enforcement actions; requirements that we change our marketing or other business practices in a manner unfavorable to us; litigation (including potential class action litigation); fines and penalties; or negative publicity. Any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nIn addition, compliance with new laws or regulations, or modifications to existing laws or regulations, could impair our ability to retain or attract subscribers, reduce demand for our products, or increase our cost of doing business. For example:\n\u2022\nAnti-spam laws that require that our subscribers\u2019 customers have the ability to opt out of receiving commercial emails, or \"opt-in\" rules that require them to affirmatively elect to receive commercial emails, may reduce the effectiveness of our products and marketing efforts, particularly Constant Contact\u2019s email marketing solution.\n\u2022\nConsumer protection laws or regulations requiring us to obtain additional consents from subscribers or to provide them with additional disclosures in order to be permitted to automatically renew their subscriptions, or to automatically enroll them into paid subscriptions after a free trial period, could impair our ability to retain or attract subscribers and increase the potential for civil liability under consumer protection laws.\n\u2022\nFurther regulation of cookies, web beacons and similar technology for online behavioral advertising (such as the consent requirements for cookies and similar technologies established by the GDPR or the opt-out requirements established by the CCPA) may lead to broader restrictions on our collection and use of online usage information in order to attract and retain customers. Such regulation may also restrict collection of the data from our subscribers' customers and contacts as well as how we may use this data. This could impair our ability to collect, transfer and/or use information that we use to provide targeted advertising to our subscribers or to assist our subscribers in marketing to their own customers, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain and grow our subscriber base.\n\u2022\nPrivacy laws requiring that certain data associated with domain name registration be kept private (including, for example, requirements that prohibit publishing the identity of a party registering a domain name) could reduce our revenue from sales of domain privacy products, since consumers in the jurisdictions where these laws apply would no longer need to purchase these products to maintain the privacy of their data.\n\u2022\nThe adoption of any laws or regulations adversely affecting the growth, popularity, accessibility or use of the Internet, including laws impacting Internet neutrality (such as the 2015 repeal of U.S. Internet neutrality regulations) or new tax regulations or court decisions concerning the taxation of online commerce, could decrease the demand for our products, require us to make modifications to our products, or increase our operating costs.\nWe rely on third parties to carry out a number of services for us, including processing personal data on our behalf. While we enter into contractual arrangements to help ensure that these parties only process such data according to our instructions and have sufficient security measures in place, any security breach or non-compliance with our contractual terms or breach of\napplicable law by such third parties could result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause our subscribers to lose trust in us. In particular, under certain circumstances, we may be considered liable for non-compliance by our third-party partners under the GDPR, the CCPA or other privacy laws and regulations. We also use third parties to provide marketing and advertising of our products and services, and we could be liable for, or face reputational harm as a result of, their marketing practices if, for example, they fail to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. These or similar instances of noncompliance by our third-party partners could have an adverse impact on our reputation and business.\nFailure to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nIn order to protect our intellectual property, proprietary technologies and processes, we rely upon a combination of trademark, patent and trade secret law, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions. These afford only limited protection, may not prevent disclosure of confidential information, and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties, including employees, subscribers and third parties, have made, and in the future may make, unauthorized or infringing use of our brand names, products, services, software and other functionality, in whole or in part, or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary.\nPolicing our proprietary rights and protecting our brands and domain names is difficult and costly and may not always be effective. In addition, we may need to enforce our rights under the laws of countries that do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States and any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, the intellectual property laws in any country in which we operate may compromise our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights.\nLitigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation or proceedings could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to our management, result in a diversion of resources, the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property, and have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement of another party\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nThere is significant litigation in the United States and abroad involving patents and other intellectual property rights. Companies providing Internet-based products and services are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to suits alleging infringement of proprietary rights, particularly patent rights. The risk of patent litigation has been amplified by the increase in certain third parties, so-called \u201cnon-practicing entities,\u201d whose sole business is to assert patent claims and against which our own intellectual property portfolio may provide little deterrent value.\nWe could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or defending any intellectual property litigation and we have incurred such costs in the past. If we sue to enforce our rights or are sued by a third party that claims that our solutions infringe its rights, the litigation could be expensive and could divert our management\u2019s time and attention. Even a threat of litigation could result in substantial expense and time. In addition, some of our agreements with partners and others require us to indemnify those parties for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us resulting from an adverse ruling on any such claim.\nAny intellectual property litigation to which we might become a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ncease selling or using solutions that incorporate the intellectual property that our solutions allegedly infringe;\n\u2022\nmake substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments or other costs or damages;\n\u2022\nobtain a license or enter into a royalty agreement, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, to sell or use the relevant technology; or\n\u2022\nredesign the allegedly infringing solutions to avoid infringement, which could be costly, time-consuming or impossible.\nIf we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement claims against us, our business or operating results could be harmed.\nIn addition, many companies are devoting significant resources to obtaining patents that could affect many aspects of our business, and our competitors and others may have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have. Since we do not have, and are not attempting to develop, a significant patent portfolio, this may prevent us from deterring patent infringement claims as well as limit our ability to develop product enhancements that are similar to patented third-party technology.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software could adversely affect our ability to sell our services and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe use open source software in providing a substantial portion of our solutions, and we may incorporate additional open source software in the future. Such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. If we fail to comply with these licenses, we may be subject to certain conditions, including requirements that we offer our solutions that incorporate the open source software for no cost; that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software; and/or that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. In addition, if a third-party software provider has incorporated open source software into software that we license from such provider, we could be required to disclose any of our source code that incorporates or is a modification of such licensed software. If an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our solutions that contained the open source software, and required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our solutions. In addition, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Such litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products.\nWe could face liability, or our reputation might be harmed, as a result of the activities of our subscribers, the content of their websites, the data they store on our servers or the emails that they send.\nWe could face liability or incur other costs as a result of the activities of our subscribers. Although the statutes discussed in Part I, Item 1, Business (including the DMCA and the CDA) and case law in the United States have generally shielded us from liability for subscriber activities to date, court rulings in pending or future litigation, or future legislative or regulatory actions, may narrow the scope of protection afforded us under these laws. Several court decisions and the enactment of FOSTA arguably have already narrowed the scope of the immunity provided to interactive computer services in the United States under the CDA. In addition, laws governing an Internet service provider's role in monitoring subscriber activities are unsettled in many international jurisdictions, or may prove difficult or impossible for us to comply with in some international jurisdictions. Also, notwithstanding the exculpatory language of these bodies of law, we may be embroiled in complaints and lawsuits which, even if ultimately resolved in our favor, add cost to our doing business and may divert management\u2019s time and attention. Finally, other existing bodies of law, including the criminal laws of various states, may be deemed to apply or new statutes or regulations may be adopted in the future, any of which could expose us to further liability and increase our costs of doing business.\nWe may face liability in connection with ownership or control of subscriber accounts, domain names or email contact lists or in connection with domain names we own.\nAs a provider of cloud-based solutions, including as a registrar of domain names and related services, we have faced and may continue to face liability or costs related to ownership or control of subscriber accounts, websites, domain names or email contact lists, or in connection with domain names we own, including the following:\n\u2022\nOur failure to renew a subscriber\u2019s domain name or for our role in the wrongful transfer of control or ownership of accounts, websites or domain names;\n\u2022\nOther forms of account, website or domain name \u201chijacking,\u201d including misappropriation by third parties of subscriber accounts, websites or domain names;\n\u2022\nTrademark infringement if one or more domain names in our domain name portfolios that we own and provide for resale is alleged to violate another party\u2019s trademark;\n\u2022\nInfringement of third party trademarks or copyrights if advertisements displayed on websites associated with domains registered by us contain allegedly infringing content placed by third parties; and\n\u2022\nProviding the identity and contact details of a domain name registrant who has purchased our domain privacy service, or who has rights preventing disclosure of such information under the GDPR, even though our terms of service reserve the right to provide the underlying WHOIS information and/or to cancel privacy services on domain names in certain circumstances.\nOccasionally a subscriber may register a domain name that is identical or similar to another party\u2019s trademark or the name of a living person. Disputes involving registration or control of domain names are often resolved through the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy, or UDRP, ICANN\u2019s administrative process for domain name dispute resolution, or through litigation under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, or ACPA, or under general theories of trademark infringement or dilution. The UDRP generally does not impose liability on registrars, and the ACPA provides that registrars may not be held liable for registering or maintaining a domain name absent a showing of bad faith, intent to profit or reckless disregard of a court order by the registrar. However, we may face liability if we fail to comply in a timely manner with procedural requirements under these rules. In addition, these processes typically require involvement by us and, therefore, could result in increased costs for us.\nWe are subject to export controls and economic sanctions laws that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.\nOur business activities are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export controls and trade and economic sanctions laws, including the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, which prohibit certain transactions with U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities. These laws and regulations, and the targets of U.S. sanctions, are subject to change, including without advance notice.\nAlthough we take precautions and have implemented, and continue to seek to enhance, compliance measures to prevent transactions with U.S. sanction targets, from time to time we have identified, and we expect to continue to identify, instances of non-compliance with these laws, rules and regulations and transactions which we are required to block and report to OFAC. In particular, as we enhance the systems we use to screen out prohibited transactions, we may identify additional instances of non-compliance. In addition, as a result of our acquisition activities, we have acquired, and we may acquire in the future, companies for which we could face potential liability or penalties for violations if they have not implemented sufficient compliance measures to prevent transactions with targets of U.S. and other applicable sanctions laws. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, government investigations, and reputational harm. In addition, if our third-party resellers fail to comply with these laws and regulations in their dealings, we could face potential liability or penalties for violations.\nChanges in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction and sale of our solutions in international markets, prevent our subscribers with international operations from deploying our solutions or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any limitations or prohibitions on, or delays affecting, our ability to export or sell our solutions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nImpairment of goodwill and other intangible assets would result in a decrease in earnings.\nCurrent accounting rules provide that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives may not be amortized, but instead must be tested for impairment at least annually. These rules also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Additionally, a reorganization of or change in the number of reporting units could result in the reassignment of goodwill between reporting units and may trigger an impairment assessment. We have substantial goodwill and other intangible assets, and we would be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined. Any impairment charges or changes to the estimated amortization periods could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We recorded charges for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during 2019, and it is possible we will record additional impairment charges in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Substantial Indebtedness\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe now have, and expect to continue to have, significant indebtedness that could result in a material and adverse effect on our business. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.7 billion of aggregate indebtedness, not including original issue discounts of $16.9 million and deferred financing costs of $25.7 million. Under our first lien term loan facility entered into on June 20, 2018, which refinanced our prior first lien term loan facility, we are required to repay approximately $7.9 million of principal at the end of each quarter and are required to pay accrued interest upon the maturity of each interest accrual period. We estimate that our interest payments on our first lien term loan facility will be approximately $78.3 million for 2020. The interest accrual periods under our Senior Credit Facilities are typically three months in duration, except for LIBOR-based revolver loans, which are generally one or three months in duration. The actual amounts of our debt servicing payments vary based on the amounts of indebtedness outstanding, whether we borrow on a LIBOR or base rate basis, the applicable interest accrual periods and the applicable interest rates, which vary based on prescribed formulas. We are also required to pay accrued interest on the Senior Notes on a semi-annual basis. We estimate that we will pay approximately $38.1 million of interest on the Senior Notes during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future. The terms of our Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Senior Notes permit us to incur additional debt subject to certain conditions. This high level of debt could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse financial, business, economic and industry conditions, as well as other factors that are beyond our control;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to refinance, or resulting in our inability to refinance, all or a portion of our indebtedness at or before maturity, on favorable terms or at all, whether due to uncertain credit markets, our business performance, or other factors;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less highly leveraged;\n\u2022\nrestricting our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are, and may in the future be, at variable interest rates;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to sell assets or incur additional indebtedness if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our liquidity needs; and\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to fund other liquidity needs.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events or our failure to generate sufficient cash flow from operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face, as described further herein, could intensify and we may not be able to meet all our debt obligations.\nThe elimination of LIBOR could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced plans to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. In addition, other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates. These may be replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, or other benchmark rates over the next several years. Although the impact is uncertain at this time, the elimination of LIBOR could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We have approximately $1,374.0 million principal amount of LIBOR-based debt under our Senior Credit Facilities. All of this amount will convert to a floating interest rate based on the prime rate if LIBOR is discontinued, which would likely result in increased interest expense. We may incur significant expenses to amend our LIBOR-indexed loans, derivatives, and other applicable financial or contractual obligations, including our Senior Credit Facilities and interest rate caps, to a new reference rate, which may differ significantly from LIBOR. Accordingly, the use of an alternative rate could result in increased costs, including increased interest expense on our Senior Credit Facilities, and increased borrowing and hedging costs in the future. Additionally, the elimination of LIBOR may adversely impact the value of and the expected return on our existing interest rate cap and any other derivatives, as well as any other contracts that reference LIBOR. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR and we are unable to predict the effect of any such alternatives on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe terms of our Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Senior Notes impose restrictions on our business, reducing our operational flexibility and creating default risks. Failure to comply with these restrictions, or other events, could result in default under the relevant agreements that could trigger an acceleration of our indebtedness that we may not be able to repay.\nOur Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Senior Notes require compliance with a set of financial and non-financial covenants. These covenants contain numerous restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments (including any dividends or other distributions in respect of our capital stock and any investments);\n\u2022\nsell or transfer assets;\n\u2022\nenter into affiliate transactions;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\ntake other actions.\nAs a result, we may be restricted from engaging in business activities that may otherwise improve our business or from financing future operations or capital needs. We are also required to comply with a financial covenant to not exceed a maximum ratio of consolidated senior secured net indebtedness to an adjusted consolidated EBITDA measure. Failure to comply with the covenants, if not cured or waived, could result in an event of default that could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness, which would require us to repay all amounts owing under our Senior Credit Facilities and the Senior Notes and could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Senior\nNotes also contain provisions that trigger repayment obligations, including in some cases upon a change of control, as well as various representations and warranties which, if breached, could lead to events of default. We cannot be certain that our future operating results will be sufficient to ensure compliance with the covenants in our Senior Credit Facilities or the indenture governing the Senior Notes or to remedy any defaults under our Senior Credit Facilities or the indenture governing the Senior Notes. In addition, in the event of any event of default and related acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments.\nEIG Investors, the borrower under our Senior Credit Facilities and the Issuer of the Senior Notes, is a holding company, and may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness.\nEIG Investors Corp, or EIG Investors, the borrower under our Senior Credit Facilities and the issuer of the Senior Notes, has no direct operations and no significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Because it conducts its operations through its operating subsidiaries, EIG Investors depends on those entities to generate the funds necessary to meet its financial obligations, including its required obligations under our Senior Credit Facilities and the Senior Notes. The ability of our subsidiaries to make transfers and other distributions to EIG Investors is subject to, among other things, the terms of any debt instruments of those subsidiaries then in effect, applicable law, prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If transfers or other distributions from our subsidiaries to EIG Investors were eliminated, delayed, reduced or otherwise impaired, its ability to make payments on its obligations would be substantially impaired.\nFurthermore, if EIG Investors\u2019 cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund its debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, seek additional capital, restructure or refinance EIG Investors\u2019 or our indebtedness, or sell assets. We may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis, on satisfactory terms, or at all, which would limit EIG Investors\u2019 ability to meet its scheduled debt service obligations (including in respect of our Senior Credit Facilities or the Senior Notes). Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and the financial condition of EIG Investors and us at the time. Any refinancing of EIG Investors\u2019 debt could be at higher interest rates and may require EIG Investors to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Our Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Senior Notes will also restrict our ability to use the proceeds from asset sales. We may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair, and any proceeds that we receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on EIG Investors\u2019 outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis could result in an event of default that would trigger acceleration of our indebtedness and would likely result in a reduction of EIG Investors' credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness.\nEIG Investors may not be able to repurchase the Senior Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer, which would cause a default under the indenture governing the Senior Notes and our Senior Credit Facilities.\nUpon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events, EIG Investors will be required under the indenture governing the Senior Notes to offer to repurchase all outstanding Senior Notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, unless the Senior Notes have been previously called for redemption. The source of funds for any such purchase of the Senior Notes will be EIG Investors\u2019 available cash or cash generated from its subsidiaries\u2019 operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. EIG Investors may not be able to repurchase the Senior Notes upon a change of control because it may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the Senior Notes that are tendered upon a change of control. Further, the terms of our Senior Credit Facilities and any of EIG Investors' future debt agreements may restrict EIG Investors from repurchasing all of the Senior Notes tendered by holders upon a change of control. Accordingly, EIG Investors may not be able to satisfy its obligations to purchase the Senior Notes unless it is able to refinance or obtain waivers under our Senior Credit Facilities. EIG Investors\u2019 failure to repurchase the Senior Notes upon a change of control would cause an event of default under the indenture governing the Senior Notes and a cross-default under our Senior Credit Facilities. Our Senior Credit Facilities also provide that a change of control is an event of default that permits lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Any of EIG Investors\u2019 future debt agreements may contain similar provisions.\nIn addition, in certain circumstances following a non-ordinary course asset sale as specified in the indenture governing the Senior Notes, EIG Investors may be required to commence an offer to purchase the Senior Notes with the proceeds from the asset sale at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our Senior Credit Facilities and any of EIG Investors' future debt agreements may contain restrictions that would limit or prohibit EIG Investors from completing any such offer. EIG Investors\u2019 failure to purchase any such Senior Notes when required under the indenture would be an event of default and a cross-default under our Senior Credit Facilities.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and may in the future be volatile, which could cause holders of our common stock to incur substantial losses.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may in the future be subject to substantial price volatility. As a result of this volatility, our stockholders could incur substantial losses. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the factors listed below and other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section:\n\u2022\nlow trading volume, which could cause even a small number of purchases or sales of our stock to have an impact on the trading price of our common stock;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of comparable companies;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our earnings or any financial projections we may provide to the public, or fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations for, or evaluations of, our stock by securities analysts, or decisions by securities or industry analysts not to publish or to cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market;\n\u2022\nratings changes by debt ratings agencies;\n\u2022\nshort sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving our capital stock;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new products, strategic alliances, or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nlitigation or regulatory proceedings involving us; and\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel.\nSecurities class action litigation is sometimes brought against companies that experience periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. As discussed in Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in 2015, separate class action securities lawsuits were filed against us and Constant Contact; we settled one of these lawsuits in 2019, and we expect the final settlement hearing for the other to take place in the first half of 2020. In the future, we may be the target of additional securities litigation related to volatility in our stock, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nA substantial portion of our issued and outstanding common stock can be traded without restriction at any time, and the remaining shares of our issued and outstanding common stock can be sold subject to volume limitations and other requirements applicable to affiliate sales under the federal securities laws. As such, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, we have registered 38,000,000 shares of common stock that have been issued or reserved for future issuance under our Amended and Restated 2013 Stock Incentive Plan and 14,346,830 shares of common stock that have been issued or reserved for future issuance under our Constant Contact, Inc. Second Amended and Restated 2011 Stock Incentive Plan. Of these shares, as of December 31, 2019, a total of 28,619,888 shares of our common stock are subject to outstanding options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards, of which 17,526,179 shares are exercisable or have vested. The exercise of these options or the vesting of restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock and the subsequent sale of the common stock underlying such options or upon the vesting of such restricted stock units and restricted stock awards could cause a decline in our stock price. These sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that any future issuances may have on the market price for our common stock.\nIn addition, holders of an aggregate of 65,693,919 shares of our common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. Once we register these shares, they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to any applicable vesting requirements.\nInsiders have substantial control over us, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our directors, executive officers and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, 50.3% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Specifically, investment funds and entities affiliated with Warburg Pincus own, in the aggregate, 35.9% of our issued and outstanding common stock, and investment funds and entities affiliated with Goldman Sachs own, in the aggregate, approximately 10.5% of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if they act together, could have significant influence over the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. Our stockholders\u2019 agreement contains agreements among the parties with respect to certain matters, including the election of directors, and certain restrictions on our ability to effect specified corporate transactions. If these stockholders were\nto act together, they could have significant influence over the management and affairs of our company. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company and might affect the market price of our common stock. In particular, the significant ownership interest of investment funds and entities affiliated with Warburg Pincus and Goldman Sachs in our common stock could adversely affect investors\u2019 perceptions of our corporate governance practices.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and our stockholders agreement, as well as provisions of Delaware law, might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, our stockholders agreement and Delaware law contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued without stockholder approval and with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings;\n\u2022\nproviding that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be taken at a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be taken by any consent in writing by such stockholders;\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors, subject to limited exceptions set forth in our stockholders agreement;\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board of directors and stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nproviding our board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings;\n\u2022\nestablishing a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nestablishing Delaware as the exclusive jurisdiction for specified types of stockholder litigation involving us or our directors;\n\u2022\nproviding that for so long as investment funds and entities affiliated with Warburg Pincus have the right to designate at least three directors for election to our board of directors, certain actions required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders, including amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws and certain specified corporate transactions, may be effected only with the affirmative vote of 75% of our board of directors, in addition to any other vote required by applicable law;\n\u2022\nproviding that for so long as investment funds and entities affiliated with Warburg Pincus have the right to designate at least one director for election to our board of directors and for so long as investment funds and entities affiliated with Goldman Sachs have the right to designate one director for election to our board of directors, in each case, a quorum of our board of directors will not exist without at least one director designee of each of Warburg Pincus and Goldman Sachs present at such meeting, subject to limited exceptions set forth in our stockholders agreement;\n\u2022\nlimiting the determination of the number of directors on our board of directors and the filling of vacancies or newly created seats on the board to our board of directors then in office; subject to limited exceptions set forth in our stockholders agreement; and\n\u2022\nproviding that directors may be removed by stockholders only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast in an annual election of directors; provided that any director designated by investment funds and entities affiliated with either Warburg Pincus or Goldman Sachs may be removed with or without cause only by Warburg Pincus or Goldman Sachs, respectively.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our issued and outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our issued and outstanding common stock. Since the investment funds and entities affiliated with Warburg Pincus and Goldman Sachs became holders of more than 15% of our issued and outstanding common stock in a transaction that was approved by our board of directors, the restrictions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law would not apply to a business combination transaction with any investment funds or entities affiliated with either Warburg Pincus or Goldman Sachs. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation expressly exempts investment funds and entities affiliated with either Warburg Pincus or Goldman Sachs from the applicability of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Any provision of our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nCertain of our stockholders have the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us.\nInvestment funds and entities affiliated with Warburg Pincus or Goldman Sachs, together, hold a significant interest in our company. Warburg Pincus, Goldman Sachs and their respective affiliates have other investments and business activities in addition to their ownership of our company. Warburg Pincus, Goldman Sachs and their respective affiliates have the right, and have no duty to abstain from exercising the right, to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we have, on behalf of ourselves, our subsidiaries and our and their respective stockholders, renounced any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any business opportunity that may be presented to Warburg Pincus, Goldman Sachs or any of their respective affiliates, partners, principals, directors, officers, members, managers, employees or other representatives, and no such person has any duty to communicate or offer such business opportunity to us or any of our subsidiaries or shall be liable to us or any of our subsidiaries or any of our or its stockholders for breach of any duty, as a director or officer or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person pursues or acquires such business opportunity, directs such business opportunity to another person or fails to present such business opportunity, or information regarding such business opportunity, to us or our subsidiaries, unless, in the case of any such person who is a director or officer of ours, such business opportunity is expressly offered to such director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of ours.\nWe may not pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not currently anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Instead, we expect to retain any earnings to invest in our business. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends is currently limited by the terms of our Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Senior Notes, and any future credit agreement may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, to realize any return on their investment.", "PERMNO": 14244, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "EIGI"}
