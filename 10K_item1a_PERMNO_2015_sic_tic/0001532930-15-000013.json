Therefore, we are indirectly subject to the business and financial risks of Chesapeake. We have no control over Chesapeake's business decisions and operations, and Chesapeake is under no obligation to adopt a business strategy that is favorable to us.\nWe currently provide a significant percentage of our oilfield services and equipment to Chesapeake and its working interest partners. However, revenues derived from other E&P customers have increased since 2012. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, Chesapeake and its working interest partners accounted for approximately 81%, 90% and 94% of our revenues, respectively. If Chesapeake ceases to engage us on terms that are attractive to us during any period, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected during such period. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the business and financial risks of Chesapeake, some of which are the following:\n\u2022\nthe volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which could have a negative effect on the value of Chesapeake's oil and natural gas properties, its drilling program, its ability to finance its operations and its willingness to allocate capital toward exploration and development activities;\n\u2022\nthe availability of capital on favorable terms to fund its exploration and development activities;\n\u2022\nits discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves and the speed at which it develops such reserves;\n\u2022\nuncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production;\n\u2022\nits drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities;\n\u2022\npipeline, storage and other transportation capacity constraints and interruptions;\n\u2022\nadverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation; and\n\u2022\nlosses from pending or future litigation.\nIn particular, Chesapeake has generally made capital expenditures in excess of its operating cash flows. To fund these expenditures, Chesapeake obtained capital from its revolving credit facility, the debt capital markets, oil and natural gas asset sales and other sources. If Chesapeake is unable to generate cash flow from operations sufficient to fund its capital expenditures, Chesapeake may be required to spend less on drilling and completion activities than it otherwise would have, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe serve customers who are involved in drilling for and producing oil and natural gas. Adverse developments affecting the oil and natural gas industry or drilling and completions activity, including sustained low oil, natural gas, or natural gas liquids prices, reduced demand for oil and natural gas products and increased regulation of drilling and production, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenues are generated from customers who are engaged in drilling for and producing oil and natural gas. Developments that adversely affect oil and natural gas drilling and production services could adversely affect our customers' demand for our products and services, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe predominant factor that would reduce demand for our products and services is reduced land-based drilling and completions activity in the continental United States. Commodity prices, and market expectations of potential changes in these prices, may significantly affect this level of activity, as well as the rates paid for our services. Oil and natural gas prices are volatile and have fluctuated dramatically recently. The New York Mercantile Exchange (\"NYMEX\") price of natural gas futures contracts per MMBtu rebounded from a low of $1.90 in 2011 to a high of $6.15 in early 2014 and dropped to $2.90 as of February 25, 2015. In addition, oil prices reached record highs in 2008, dropped below $40 per barrel in 2009, rose to $107 per barrel in 2014 and traded on the NYMEX at a West Texas Intermediate (WTI) spot price of $50.25 per barrel as of February 25, 2015. We negotiate the rates payable under our contracts based on prevailing market prices. Declines in the prices of oil, natural gas, or natural gas liquids could have an adverse impact on the level of drilling, exploration and production activity, which could materially and adversely affect the demand for our products and services and our results of operations. However, higher commodity prices do not necessarily translate into increased drilling and completions activity because our customers' expectations of future prices also influences their activity. Additionally, we have incurred costs and had downtime in the past as we redeployed equipment and personnel from one play to another to meet our customers' needs and may in the future incur redeployment costs and have downtime any time our customers' activities are refocused towards different drilling regions.\nAnother factor that would reduce demand for our products and services is a decline in the level of drilling and production activity as a result of increased government regulation of that activity. Our customers' drilling and production operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and government regulations concerning emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases; hydraulic fracturing; the handling of oil and natural gas and byproducts thereof and other materials and substances used in connection with oil and natural gas operations, including drilling fluids and wastewater; well spacing; production limitations; plugging and abandonment of wells; unitization and pooling of properties; and taxation. More stringent legislation or regulation, a moratorium on drilling or hydraulic fracturing, or increased taxation of oil and natural gas drilling and completions activity could directly curtail such activity or increase the cost of drilling, resulting in reduced levels of drilling and completions activity and therefore reduced demand for our products and services.\nDemand for services in our industry is cyclical and depends on drilling and completion spending by Chesapeake and other E&P companies in the U.S., and the level of such activity is cyclical.\nDemand for services in our industry is cyclical, and we depend on Chesapeake's and our other customers' willingness to make capital and operating expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the U.S. Our customers' willingness to undertake these activities depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u2022\nprices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe availability, pricing and perceived safety of pipeline, trucking, train storage and other transportation capacity;\n\u2022\nlead times associated with acquiring equipment and availability of qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nthe expected rates of decline in production from existing and prospective wells;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nlaws and regulations relating to environmental matters;\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield activities, including public pressure on governmental bodies and regulatory agencies to regulate our industry;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions, including hurricanes that can affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area;\n\u2022\noil refining capacity;\n\u2022\nmerger and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers;\n\u2022\ntax laws, regulation and policies;\n\u2022\nthe availability of water resources and suitable proppants in sufficient quantities and on acceptable terms for use in hydraulic fracturing operations;\n\u2022\nthe availability, capacity and cost of disposal and recycling services for used hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u2022\nthe political environment in oil and natural gas producing regions, including uncertainty or instability resulting from civil disorder, terrorism or war;\n\u2022\nadvances in exploration, development and production technologies or in technologies affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels and energy sources;\n\u2022\nuncertainty in capital and commodities markets; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of oil and natural gas producers to raise capital on favorable terms.\nAnticipated future prices for crude oil and natural gas are a primary factor affecting spending and drilling and completions activity by E&P companies, including Chesapeake. Actual or anticipated lower prices or volatility in prices for oil and natural gas typically decrease spending and drilling and completions activity, which can cause rapid and material declines in demand for our services and in the prices we are able to charge for our services. Worldwide political, economic and military events as well as natural disasters and other factors beyond our control contribute to oil and natural gas price levels and volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future.\nWe negotiate the rates payable under our contracts based on prevailing market prices, and, consequently, the prices we are able to charge will fluctuate with market conditions. A material decline in oil and natural gas prices or drilling and completions\nactivity levels or sustained lower prices or activity levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, since the end of the fourth quarter of 2014, we have been experiencing a decline in the demand for our services and the prices we are able to charge in conjunction with the sharp decline in oil prices. If the decline in prices worsens or is prolonged, there would likely be a further negative affect on oil and natural gas production levels and, therefore, we would likely see a further negative affect on the demand for and prices of the services we provide. Additionally, we may incur costs and have downtime any time our customers' activities are refocused towards different drilling regions.\nSpending by E&P companies can also be impacted by conditions in the capital markets. Limitations on the availability of capital, or higher costs of capital, for financing expenditures may cause Chesapeake and other E&P companies to make additional reductions to capital budgets in the future even if oil or natural gas prices increase from current levels. Any such cuts in spending will curtail drilling and completion programs as well as discretionary spending on wellsite services, which may result in a reduction in the demand for our services, the rates we can charge and the utilization of our services. Moreover, reduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves, or a decrease in the development rate of reserves in our market areas, whether due to increased governmental or environmental regulation, limitations on exploration and drilling and completions activity or other factors, could also have an impact on our business, even in a stronger oil and natural gas price environment. An adverse development in any of these areas could have an adverse impact on our customers' operations or financial condition, which could in turn result in reduced demand for our products and services.\nOur industry is highly competitive. If we are unable to compete successfully, our profitability may be reduced.\nThe market for oilfield services in which we operate is highly competitive. Price competition, rig or fleet availability, location and suitability, experience of the workforce, safety records, reputation, operating integrity and condition of the equipment are all factors used by customers in awarding contracts. Our future success and profitability will partly depend upon our ability to keep pace with our customers' demands with respect to these factors. Our competitors are numerous, ranging from terminal companies and major oil companies to other independent marketers and distributors of varying sizes, financial resources and experience. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources than us. Contracts are traditionally awarded on the basis of competitive bids or direct negotiations with customers. The competitive environment could intensify if there is consolidation among E&P companies because such consolidation would reduce the number of available customers. The fact that drilling rigs and other oilfield services equipment are mobile and can be moved from one market to another in response to market conditions heightens the competition in the industry. In addition, any increase in the supply of land drilling rigs and hydraulic fracturing fleets could have a material adverse impact on market prices under our contracts and utilization rates of our services. This increased supply could also require higher capital investment to keep our services competitive.\nOur business involves many hazards and operational risks, and we are not insured against all the risks we face.\nOur operations are subject to many hazards and risks, including the following:\n\u2022\naccidents resulting in serious bodily injury and the loss of life or property;\n\u2022\nliabilities from accidents or damage by our fleet of trucks, rigs and other equipment;\n\u2022\npollution and other damage to the environment;\n\u2022\nwell blow-outs, the uncontrolled flow of oil, natural gas or other well fluids into or through the environment, including onto the ground or into the atmosphere, surface waters or an underground formation;\n\u2022\nfires and explosions;\n\u2022\nmechanical or technological failures;\n\u2022\nspillage handling and disposing of materials;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions; and\n\u2022\nfailure of our employees to comply with our internal environmental health and safety guidelines.\nIf any of these hazards occur, they could result in suspension of operations, termination of contracts without compensation, damage to or destruction of our equipment and the property of others, or injury or death to our personnel or third parties and could expose us to substantial liability or losses. The frequency and severity of such incidents will affect operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators. In addition, these risks may be greater for us upon the acquisition of another company that has not allocated significant resources and management focus to safety and has a poor safety record.\nWe are not fully insured against all risks inherent in our business. For example, we do not have any business interruption/loss of income insurance that would provide coverage in the event of damage to any of our equipment or facilities. Although we are insured for environmental pollution resulting from environmental accidents that occur on a sudden and accidental basis, we may not be insured against all environmental accidents that might occur, some of which may result in toxic tort claims. If a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies may substantially increase. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. Please read \"Business-Risk Management and Insurance\" in Item 1 of this report.\nOur business may be adversely affected by a deterioration in general economic conditions or the further weakening of the broader energy industry.\nA prolonged economic slowdown, another recession in the United States, adverse events relating to the energy industry and local, regional and national economic conditions and factors, particularly a worsening of the recent slowdown in the E&P industry, could negatively impact our operations and therefore, adversely affect our results. The risks associated with our business are more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession because such periods may be accompanied by decreased spending by our customers.\nRestrictions in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe operating and financial restrictions in our credit facility, term loan, and in the indentures governing our outstanding notes and any future financing agreements could restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, or otherwise pursue our business activities. For example, our credit facility and the indenture governing our outstanding notes limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or issue guarantees;\n\u2022\nincur or permit certain liens to exist;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments, acquisitions or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\ndispose of assets;\n\u2022\nengage in certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nprepay certain indebtedness.\nFurthermore, our credit facility contains a covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio when availability is below a certain threshold and for a certain period.\nA failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, would permit the exercise of remedies against us that would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Remedies under our credit facility and term loan include foreclosure on the collateral securing the indebtedness, which includes operating assets and accounts receivable. Moreover, the existence of these covenants may also prevent or delay us from pursuing business opportunities that we believe would otherwise benefit us.\nWe are highly leveraged and may incur additional debt in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $1.599 billion of indebtedness, comprised of $1.150 billion of senior notes, $398.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our term loan, and $50.5 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $218.7 million of additional borrowing capacity, net of letters of credit of $5.8 million.\nOur level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to support the payment of debt service;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, and putting us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have fewer fixed obligations and greater cash flows to devote to their businesses;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in operating our business and preventing us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us.\nAny failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis or to satisfy our liquidity needs would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our credit facility, term loan, and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional indebtedness and other obligations in the future. If we incur additional debt, the related risks that we face could intensify.\nOur assets may require significant amounts of capital for maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment.\nOur drilling rigs and hydraulic fracturing fleets may require significant capital investment in maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment to maintain the competitiveness of our assets. Our rigs and fleets typically do not generate revenue while they are undergoing maintenance, refurbishment or upgrades. Any maintenance, upgrade or refurbishment project for our assets could increase our indebtedness or reduce cash available for other opportunities. Further, such projects may require proportionally greater capital investments as a percentage of total asset value, which may make such projects difficult to finance on acceptable terms. To the extent we are unable to fund such projects, we may have fewer rigs and fleets available for service or our rigs and fleets may not be attractive to potential or current customers. Such demands on our capital or reductions in demand for our rigs and fleets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe participate in a capital intensive industry and we may not be able to finance our capital needs.\nWe intend to rely primarily on cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility to fund our future capital expenditures. If our cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility are not sufficient to fund our capital expenditures, we would be required to fund these expenditures through the issuance of debt or equity or alternative financing plans, such as:\n\u2022\nrefinancing or restructuring our debt;\n\u2022\nselling assets; or\n\u2022\nreducing or delaying acquisitions or capital investments, such as planned upgrades or acquisitions of equipment and refurbishments of our rigs and related equipment, even if previously publicly announced.\nThe terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. If debt and equity capital or alternative financing plans are not available on favorable terms or at all, we would be required to curtail our\ncapital spending, and our ability to sustain or improve our profits may be adversely affected. Our ability to refinance or restructure our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, among other things. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.\nWe may need to obtain additional capital or financing to fund expansion of our asset base, which could increase our financial leverage.\nIn order to expand our asset base, we will need to make growth capital expenditures. These expenditures may be significant because our assets require significant capital to purchase and modify. If we do not make sufficient or effective expansion capital expenditures, we will be unable to expand our business operations and may be required to use cash from our operations or incur borrowings or sell common stock or other securities in order to fund our expansion capital expenditures. Our ability to obtain financing or to access the capital markets for future equity or debt offerings may be limited by our financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering, as well as by the covenants in our debt agreements, general economic conditions and contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. In addition, incurring additional debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage, and issuing common stock may result in significant dilution to our current shareholders.\nWe may not be successful in identifying and making acquisitions.\nPart of our strategy to grow our business is dependent on our ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in revenues and customer contracts. We may be unable to make accretive acquisitions or realize expected benefits of any acquisitions for any of the following reasons:\n\u2022\nfailure to identify attractive targets in the marketplace;\n\u2022\nincorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or assets or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring operations or assets;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain acceptable financing;\n\u2022\nrestrictions in our debt agreements;\n\u2022\nfailure to integrate successfully the operations or management of any acquired operations or assets in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain or attract key employees; and\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from existing operations or other priorities.\nOur acquisition strategy requires that we successfully integrate acquired companies into our business practices as well as our procurement, management and enterprise-wide information technology systems. We may not be successful in implementing our business practices at acquired companies, and our acquisitions could face difficulty in transitioning from their previous information technology systems to our own. Any such difficulties, or increased costs associated with such integration, could affect our financial performance and operations.\nIf we are unable to identify, complete and integrate acquisitions, it could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nShortages or increases in the costs of the equipment we use in our operations could adversely affect our operations in the future.\nWe generally do not have long term contracts in place that provide for the delivery of equipment, including, but not limited to, drill pipe, replacement parts and other equipment. We could experience delays in the delivery of the equipment that we have ordered and its placement into service due to factors that are beyond our control. New federal regulations regarding diesel engines, demand by other oilfield services companies and numerous other factors beyond our control could adversely affect our ability to procure equipment that we have not yet ordered or cause the prices of such equipment to increase. Price\nincreases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to increase capital and repair expenditures and incur higher operating costs. In certain instances, we may have the ability to cancel purchases of equipment that may no longer be needed. Each of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a small number of suppliers for key raw materials and finished products.\nWe do not have long term contracts with third party suppliers for many of the raw materials and finished products that we use in large volumes in our operations, including, in the case of our hydraulic fracturing operations, proppants, acid, gels, including guar gum, chemicals and water, and fuels used in our equipment and vehicles. Especially during periods in which oilfield services are in high demand, the availability of raw materials and finished products used in our industry decreases and the price of such raw materials and finished products increases. We are dependent on a small number of suppliers for key raw materials and finished products. Our reliance on such suppliers could increase the difficulty of obtaining such raw materials and finished products in the event of shortage in our industry or cause us to pay higher prices to obtain such raw materials and finished products. Price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to incur higher operating costs. Each of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of key executives could adversely affect our ability to effectively operate and manage our business.\nWe are dependent upon the efforts and skills of our executives to operate and manage our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain these employees, and the loss of the services of one or more of our key executives could increase our exposure to the other risks described in this \"Risk Factors\" section. We do not maintain key man insurance on any of our personnel.\nIncreased labor costs or the unavailability of skilled workers could hurt our operations.\nWe are dependent upon an available pool of skilled employees to maintain our business. We compete with other oilfield services businesses and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required to provide the highest quality service. The demand for skilled workers is high and the supply is limited during periods of high drilling and completions activity levels, and a shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain personnel and could require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages thereby increasing our operating costs.\nAlthough our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, union organizational efforts could occur and, if successful, could increase our labor costs. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers or the unionization of groups of our employees could result in increases in the wage rates that we must pay. Likewise, laws and regulations to which we are subject, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions, can increase our labor costs or subject us to liabilities to our employees. We cannot assure you that labor costs will not increase. Increases in our labor costs or unavailability of skilled workers could impair our capacity and diminish our profitability, having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically, our industry has experienced a high annual employee turnover rate. We believe that the high turnover rate is attributable to the nature of the work, which is physically demanding and performed outdoors, and to the volatility and cyclical nature of the oilfield services industry. As a result, workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive with ours. We cannot assure you that we will be able to recruit, train and retain an adequate number of workers to replace departing workers. The inability to maintain an adequate workforce could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may record losses or impairment charges related to idle assets or assets that we sell.\nProlonged periods of low utilization, changes in technology or the sale of assets below their carrying value may cause us to experience losses. These events could result in the recognition of impairment charges that reduce our net income. Please read Note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for more information, including a summary of impairment charges we have recognized previously. Significant impairment charges as a result of a decline in market conditions or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur inability to obtain or implement new technology may cause us to become less competitive.\nThe oilfield services industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling and completion techniques and services using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent protection or costly to obtain. As competitors and others use or develop new technologies in the future, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that may allow them to enjoy technological advantages and implement new technologies before we can. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement new technologies or products on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. Thus, limits on our ability to effectively use and implement new and emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny future decreases in the rate at which oil or natural gas reserves are discovered or developed could decrease the demand for our services.\nReduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves, or a decrease in the development rate of reserves, in our market areas, whether due to increased governmental regulation, limitations on exploration and drilling and completions activity or other factors, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations even in a stronger oil and natural gas price environment.\nOilfield anti-indemnity provisions enacted by many states may restrict or prohibit a party's indemnification of us.\nWe typically enter into agreements with our customers governing the provision of our services, which usually include certain indemnification provisions for losses resulting from operations. Such agreement may require each party to indemnify the other against certain claims regardless of the negligence or other fault of the indemnified party; however, many states place limitations on contractual indemnity agreements, particularly agreements that indemnify a party against the consequences of its own negligence. Furthermore, certain states, including Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming, have enacted statutes generally referred to as \"oilfield anti-indemnity acts\" expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements. Such oilfield anti-indemnity acts may restrict or void a party's indemnification of us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur current backlog of contract drilling and hydraulic fracturing revenue may not be fully realized.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the contract backlog associated with our drilling and hydraulic fracturing services was approximately $2.0 billion. This amount reflects the number of days remaining in our existing drilling contracts multiplied by the applicable contractual day rate and the number of guaranteed stages remaining in our existing New Services Agreement for hydraulic fracturing multiplied by the estimated rate per stage, based on the then current contract pricing. The contractual rate may be higher than the actual rate we receive because of a number of factors, including downtime or suspension of operations. Several factors could cause downtime or a suspension of operations, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nbreakdowns of equipment;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages, including labor strikes;\n\u2022\nshortages or material and skilled labor;\n\u2022\nsevere weather or harsh operating conditions; and\n\u2022\nforce majeure events.\nWith respect to our hydraulic fracturing backlog, our New Services Agreement provides for periodic adjustments of the rates we may charge for our services thereunder, which will be negotiated based on then prevailing market pricing and in the future may be higher or lower than the current rates we charge. Moreover, we can provide no assurance that our customers will be able or willing to fulfill their contractual commitments to us. Liquidity issues could lead our customers to go into bankruptcy or could encourage our customers to seek to repudiate, cancel or renegotiate our contracts for various reasons. Many of our contracts permit early termination of the contracts by the customer for convenience (without cause), generally exercisable upon advance notice to us and in some cases without making an early termination payment to us. We calculate our contract drilling early termination value assuming each rig remains stacked for the remainder of the term of the terminated contract. Our\ninability to realize the full amount of our contract backlog amounts and early termination amounts may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. Management cannot predict the impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services, and any major changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDelays in obtaining permits by our customers for their operations could impair our business.\nOur customers are required to obtain permits from one or more governmental agencies in order to perform drilling and/or completion activities. Such permits are typically required by state agencies but can also be required by federal and local governmental agencies. The requirements for such permits vary depending on the location where such drilling and completion activities will be conducted. As with all governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit to be issued and the conditions which may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. Certain regulatory authorities have delayed or suspended the issuance of permits while the potential environmental impacts associated with issuing such permits can be studied and appropriate mitigation measures evaluated. Permitting delays, an inability to obtain new permits or revocation of our or our customers' current permits could cause a loss of revenue and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in trucking regulations may increase our costs and negatively impact our results of operations.\nFor the transportation and relocation of our drilling rigs and oilfield services equipment and our fluid handling operations, we operate trucks and other heavy equipment. Therefore, we are subject to regulation as a motor carrier by the U.S. Department of Transportation and by various state agencies, whose regulations include certain permit requirements of highway and safety authorities. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers over our trucking operations, generally governing such matters as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety, equipment testing and specifications and insurance requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may impact our operations, such as changes in fuel emissions limits, the hours of service regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period, limits on vehicle weight and size and other matters. On May 21, 2010, President Obama signed an executive memorandum directing the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\") and the EPA to develop new, stricter fuel efficiency standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks. On September 15, 2011, the NHTSA and the EPA published regulations that regulate fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions from medium- and heavy-duty trucks, beginning with vehicles built for model year 2014. As a result of these regulations, we may experience an increase in costs related to truck purchases and maintenance, an impairment of equipment productivity, a decrease in the residual value of these vehicles and an increase in operating expenses. Proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, are also made from time to time, and any such increase would increase our operating costs. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any legislative or regulatory changes applicable to our trucking operations will be enacted and to what extent any such legislation or regulations could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in laws or government regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our costs of doing business, limit the areas in which our customers can operate and reduce oil and natural gas production by our customers, which could adversely impact our business.\nRecently, there has been increased public concern regarding the adequacy of water supplies, an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water, and the suitability of disposal outlets. This has led to federal, state and local proposals that would increase the regulatory burden on hydraulic fracturing. Presently, hydraulic fracturing is regulated primarily at the state level, typically by state oil and natural gas commissions and similar agencies. Several states where we conduct our water and environmental services business, such as Texas and Pennsylvania, have either adopted or proposed laws and/or regulations to require oil and natural gas operators to disclose chemical ingredients and water volumes used to hydraulically fracture wells. The chemical ingredient information is generally available to the public via online databases, and this may bring more public scrutiny to hydraulic fracturing operations. Apart from disclosure obligations, states have been imposing more stringent well construction and monitoring requirements. Local governments likewise have been enacting restrictions on fracturing. Congress has in recent legislative sessions considered legislation to amend the SDWA, including legislation that would repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of \"underground injection\" and require\nfederal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process. The U.S. Congress may consider similar SDWA legislation in the future.\nFederal agencies have been pursuing a variety of initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing. For example, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance on February 11, 2014 addressing the performance of such activities using diesel fuels in those states where the EPA is the permitting authority. Also, in 2014, the EPA issued an advance notice or rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act to solicit public input on the information that should be reported or disclosed for hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures. Further, the EPA has announced its intention to propose federal Clean Water Act regulations in 2015 that would govern wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and certain other natural gas operations. In addition, the U.S. Department of the Interior published a revised proposed rule on May 16, 2013 that would update existing regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for disclosure, well bore integrity and handling of flowback water. Moreover, in June 2012, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (\"NIOSH\") issued a joint hazard alert for workers who use silica (commonly referred to as \"sand\") in hydraulic fracturing activities. OSHA formally proposed to lower the permissible exposure limit for airborne silica in 2013, and it has prepared guidance identifying other workplace hazards resulting from hydraulic fracturing along with ways to reduce exposure to those hazards.\nIn addition, the EPA is conducting a study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities on drinking water. The EPA issued a Progress Report in December 2012 and a draft final report is anticipated in 2015 for peer review and public comment. As part of this study, the EPA requested that certain companies provide them with information concerning the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. This study, or other studies that may be undertaken by the EPA or other governmental authorities, could spur still additional initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise. If new federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing activities are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and completions activities and make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could reduce oil and natural gas exploration and production activities by our customers and, therefore, adversely affect our business. Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance and doing business by more strictly regulating how hydraulic fracturing wastes are handled or disposed. The impact of such requirements could be materially adverse to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our customers are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding issues of health, safety, climate change and protection of the environment. Under these laws and regulations, we may become liable for penalties, damages or costs of remediation or other corrective measures. Any changes in laws or government regulations could increase our costs of doing business.\nOur and our customers' operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, protection of natural resources, wetlands, endangered species, the environment, health and safety, waste management, waste disposal and transportation of waste and other materials. Our operations pose risks of environmental liability, including leakage from our operations to surface or subsurface soils, surface water or groundwater. Environmental laws and regulations often impose strict liability and may impose joint and several liability. Therefore, in some situations, we could be exposed to liability as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, third parties without regard to whether we caused or contributed to the conditions. Actions arising under these laws and regulations could result in the shutdown of our operations, fines and penalties, expenditures for remediation or other corrective measures, and claims for liability for property damage, exposure to hazardous materials, exposure to hazardous waste or personal injuries. Sanctions for noncompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations also may include the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, revocation of permits, temporary or permanent cessation of operations in a particular location and issuance of corrective action orders. Such claims or sanctions and related costs could cause us to incur substantial costs or losses and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, an increase in regulatory requirements on oil and natural gas exploration and completion activities could significantly delay or interrupt our operations.\nIn response to certain scientific studies suggesting that emissions of GHGs, including carbon dioxide and methane, are contributing to the warming of the Earth's atmosphere and other climatic conditions, the U.S. Congress has considered adopting comprehensive legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through measures to promote the use of renewable energy and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. In addition, in December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and certain\nother GHGs endanger public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the Earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act (\"CAA\"). The EPA has already adopted rules under the CAA that require a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles, permits for certain large stationary sources of GHGs, and monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified GHG emission sources, including oil and natural gas exploration and production operations, on an annual basis. The EPA continues to consider other GHG rules, including standards for existing power plants that could lend to the creation of additional state GHG control programs. Although it is not possible at this time to estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business, either directly or indirectly, any future federal, state or local laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions in areas where we operate could require us or our customers to incur increased compliance and operating costs. Regulation of GHGs could also result in a reduction in demand for and production of oil and natural gas, which would result in a decrease in demand for our services. Additionally, to the extent that unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise, our operations may be adversely affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced, including an increase in delays and costs. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect our operations, but effects could be materially adverse. Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states likewise could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry. Moreover, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nThe EPA regulates air emissions from certain off-road diesel engines that are used by us to power equipment in the field. Under these Tier IV regulations, we are required to retrofit or retire certain engines, and we are limited in the number of non-compliant off-road diesel engines we can purchase. Tier IV engines are costlier and are not always available. Until Tier IV-compliant engines that meet our needs are available, these regulations could limit our ability to acquire a sufficient number of engines to expand our fleet and to replace existing engines as they are taken out of service.\nLaws protecting the environment generally have become more stringent over time and we expect them to continue to do so, which could lead to material increases in our costs for future environmental compliance and remediation.\nSevere weather could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAdverse weather can directly impede our operations. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include:\n\u2022\ncurtailment of services;\n\u2022\nweather-related damage to facilities and equipment, resulting in suspension of operations;\n\u2022\ninability to deliver equipment and personnel to job sites in accordance with contract schedules; and\n\u2022\nloss of productivity.\nThese constraints could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Unusually warm winters or cool summers may also adversely affect the demand for our services by decreasing the demand for natural gas. Our operations in semi-arid regions can be affected by droughts and other lack of access to water used in our operations, especially with respect to our hydraulic fracturing operations.\nOur historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of our future financial condition or future results of operations nor does it reflect what our financial condition or results of operations would have been as an independent public company during the periods presented.\nThe historical financial information prior to June 30, 2014 that we have included in this Form 10-K does not reflect what our financial condition or results of operations would have been as an independent public company during the periods presented and is not necessarily indicative of our future financial condition or future results of operations. This is primarily a result of the following factors:\n\u2022\nour historical financial results prior to June 30, 2014 reflect allocations of expenses for services historically provided by Chesapeake, and those allocations may be significantly lower than the comparable expenses we would have incurred as an independent company;\n\u2022\nour historical financial results prior to June 30, 2014 reflect Chesapeake's guarantee of utilization levels for our drilling rigs and following the spin-off such guarantee was terminated;\n\u2022\nour historical financial results prior to June 30, 2014 do not reflect various transactions that were effected in connection with the spin-off;\n\u2022\ncontracts with customers may be at less favorable rates than those in place under our arrangement with Chesapeake prior to the spin-off;\n\u2022\nour cost of debt and other capitalization is different from that reflected in our historical financial statements; and\n\u2022\nthe historical financial information may not fully reflect the increased costs associated with being an independent public company, including significant changes in our cost structure, management, financing arrangements, cash tax payment obligations and business operations as a result of our spin-off from Chesapeake, including all the costs related to being an independent public company.\nWe have a relatively short history of operating as an independent public company. We may encounter difficulties in making the changes necessary to operate as an independent public company, and we may incur greater costs as an independent public company.\nPrior to June 30, 2014, we used Chesapeake's infrastructure to support our business functions, including the following functions:\n\u2022\naccounting;\n\u2022\ninformation technology and systems;\n\u2022\nlegal;\n\u2022\ntax;\n\u2022\ninternal audit;\n\u2022\nhuman resources;\n\u2022\nprovision of office and yard space;\n\u2022\nrisk management; and\n\u2022\ntreasury.\nSince the spin-off, we have not had the same access to Chesapeake's support services as we had prior to the spin-off, and we have been establishing our own. We currently pay Chesapeake for many support services on a transitional basis pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement. For more information regarding the Transition Services Agreement, please read \"Business-The Spin-Off-Agreements Between Us and Chesapeake\" in Item 1 of this report. However, we cannot assure you that all these functions will be successfully executed by Chesapeake during the transition period or that we will not have to expend significant efforts or costs materially in excess of those estimated in the Transition Services Agreement. Any interruption in these services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, at the end of this transition period, we will need to perform these functions ourselves or hire third parties to perform these functions on our behalf. The costs associated with performing or outsourcing these functions may exceed those charged by Chesapeake when we were part of Chesapeake or during the transition period. A significant increase in the costs of performing or outsourcing these functions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting and other management systems and resources may not be sufficient to allow us to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which we are subject following the spin-off.\nPrior to the spin-off, we utilized Chesapeake's systems, software and personnel to meet our reporting obligations pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002, which requires annual assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Since the spin-off, we have been required to assume responsibility for these functions. Transitioning these functions requires, in some cases, that we add personnel and upgrade our systems, including information technology, implement additional financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures and transition various services to third party vendors. These activities place significant demands on our management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting resources, and involve risks relating to our failure to manage this transition adequately. If we are unable to upgrade our financial and management controls, reporting systems, information technology and procedures in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the Exchange Act could be adversely effected. For instance, in this annual report on Form 10-K, we have disclosed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the transition of payroll functions to a third party payroll processor. While this material weakness did not result in any material misstatement in our financial statements included within this Form 10-K, the existence of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies could result in errors in our financial statements, and substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify any internal control deficiencies. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, our stock price could decline, our ability to obtain financing might be adversely impacted and our business and financial condition could be harmed.\nA delay in completing the implementation, or a sustained failure of, our enterprise resource planning systems could adversely affect our business.\nSince the spin-off, we have begun to implement and use enterprise resource planning systems to operate our business. A delay in completing the implementation, or a sustained failure, of these systems could adversely affect our business by preventing us from:\n\u2022\nclosing our financials and preparing financial statements;\n\u2022\ntracking our repair and maintenance, payroll and other expenses;\n\u2022\ntracking fixed assets or purchase orders and receipts for supply chain purchases;\n\u2022\ngaining visibility of the financial performance at each of lines of business; and\n\u2022\nbeing able to properly manage the needs of customers.\nFollowing the completion of implementation, we will integrate our enterprise resource planning systems into our operations. If our information technology systems are disrupted due to problems with the integration of such systems or otherwise, our customers could determine that we have become unreliable and decrease their utilization of our services. Such a disruption to our information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to continuing contingent liabilities of Chesapeake following the spin-off.\nThere are several significant areas where the liabilities of Chesapeake may become our obligations. For example, under the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\") and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of Chesapeake's consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the spin-off is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period. We have entered into a tax sharing agreement with Chesapeake that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of Chesapeake's consolidated tax reporting group between us and Chesapeake and its subsidiaries. Please read \"Business-The Spin-Off-Agreements Between Us and Chesapeake\" in Item 1 of this report. However, if Chesapeake were unable to pay, we nevertheless could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes. Other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities.\nOur tax sharing agreement limits our ability to take certain actions and may require us to indemnify Chesapeake for significant tax liabilities which cannot be precisely quantified at this time.\nUnder the terms of our tax sharing agreement with Chesapeake, we generally are responsible for all taxes attributable to our business, whether accruing before, on or after the date of the spin-off, and Chesapeake generally is responsible for any taxes\narising from the spin-off or certain related transactions that are imposed on us, Chesapeake or its other subsidiaries. Although Chesapeake generally will be responsible for any taxes arising from the spin-off, we would be responsible for any such taxes to the extent such taxes result from certain actions or failures to act by us that occur after June 30, 2014, the effective date of the tax sharing agreement. Our liabilities under the tax sharing agreement could have a material adverse effect on us. At this time, we cannot precisely quantify the amount of liabilities we may have under the tax sharing agreement and there can be no assurances as to their final amounts.\nIn addition, in the tax sharing agreement we covenanted not to take any action, or fail to take any action, after the effective date of the tax sharing agreement, which action or failure to act is inconsistent with the spin-off qualifying under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. In particular, we might determine to continue to operate certain of our business operations for the foreseeable future even if a sale or discontinuance of such business might otherwise have been advantageous. Moreover, in light of the requirements of Section 355(e) of the Code, we might determine to forgo certain transactions, including share repurchases, stock issuances, certain asset dispositions or other strategic transactions for some period of time following the spin-off. In addition, our indemnity obligation under the tax sharing agreement might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control transaction for some period of time following the spin-off.\nFor a more detailed discussion, please read \"Business-The Spin-Off-Agreements Between Us and Chesapeake\" in Item 1 of this report.\nPotential indemnification liabilities to Chesapeake pursuant to the master separation agreement could materially adversely affect our company.\nThe master separation agreement with Chesapeake provides for, among other things, provisions governing the relationship between our company and Chesapeake resulting from the spin-off. For a description of the terms of the master separation agreement, please read \"Business-The Spin-Off-Agreements Between Us and Chesapeake\" in Item 1 of this report. Among other things, the master separation agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make our company financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our business activities incurred after the spin-off. If we are required to indemnify Chesapeake under the circumstances set forth in the master separation agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we will be prohibited from making an indemnity claim until we first seek an insurance recovery.\nIn connection with our separation from Chesapeake, Chesapeake will indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Chesapeake's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future.\nPursuant to the master separation agreement and tax sharing agreement, Chesapeake has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Chesapeake has agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Chesapeake will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Chesapeake will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Chesapeake any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses. If Chesapeake is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations, the underlying liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSeveral members of our board and management may have conflicts of interest because of their ownership of shares of common stock or performance share units of Chesapeake.\nSeveral members of our board and management own shares of common stock of Chesapeake, and with respect to our Chief Executive Officer, performance share units of Chesapeake, because of their prior relationships with Chesapeake. This ownership could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our directors and executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our company and Chesapeake.", "PERMNO": 14683, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "SVNT"}
