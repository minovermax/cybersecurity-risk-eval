RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous uncertainties and risks. The following risks and uncertainties may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. You should consider these risks and uncertainties carefully, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, global sociopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could suffer, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the Private Placement Issuance\n\u2022The pending strategic Private Placement Issuance may not be consummated or may be delayed.\n\u2022While the Private Placement Issuance is pending, we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could harm our business relationships, financial condition, operating results and business.\n\u2022We have incurred, and will incur, substantial expenses in connection with the Private Placement Issuance.\n\u2022Following the Closing, the Purchasers will own a significant portion of our total outstanding voting securities and may prevent other stockholders from influencing material corporate decisions following completion of the Private Placement Issuance.\n\u2022We may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the Private Placement Issuance, and we will be subject to business uncertainties that could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022The Private Placement Issuance, if consummated, will cause dilution to our current stockholders.\n\u2022The market value of our common stock could decline if the Purchasers sell their Series B Preferred Stock or common stock after certain transfer restrictions expire.\nRisks Related to our Business, Industry, and Strategy\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected our business operations.\n\u2022Our financial results and revenue growth rates have varied significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, and may not be consistent with expectations.\n\u2022We have incurred losses since inception, and we may continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future.\n\u2022The life science markets are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change.\n\u2022If our research and product development efforts do not result in commercially viable products within anticipated timelines, if at all, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\n\u2022Our future success is dependent upon our ability to expand our customer base and introduce new applications.\n\u2022If our products fail to achieve and sustain sufficient market acceptance, our revenue will be adversely affected.\n\u2022Our business growth strategy involves the potential for significant acquisitions.\n\u2022Our efficiency and cost-savings initiatives could be disruptive to our operations.\n\u2022Implementation of a company-wide enterprise resource planning (ERP) system could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Operations and Reliance on Third Parties\n\u2022We may experience development or manufacturing problems or delays.\n\u2022Our business depends on research and development spending levels of our customers.\n\u2022Disruption of our manufacturing facilities or other operations, or in the operations of our customers or business partners, could result in cancellation of orders, delays in deliveries or other business activities, or loss of customers.\n\u2022We rely on single and sole source suppliers for some of the components and materials used in our products.\n\u2022Any disruption or delay in the shipping or off-loading of our products may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Our business operations depend upon the continuing efforts of our management team and other key employees.\n\u2022Our distribution capabilities and direct sales, field support, and marketing forces must be sufficient to meet our customers\u2019 needs.\n\u2022To use our analytical systems, customers typically need to purchase specialized reagents.\n\u2022Security breaches, loss of data, cyberattacks, and other IT failures could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Quality and the Regulatory Environment\n\u2022Our products could have defects or errors.\n\u2022Although the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for our Advanta Dx SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Assay in August 2020 and an update to our EUA for use of the AZOVA COVID-19 Test Collection Kit in February 2021, among other updates, these authorizations are only valid during the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\u2022To the extent we elect to label and promote any of our non-EUA products as medical devices, we would be required to obtain prior approval or clearance by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority.\n\u2022Compliance or the failure to comply with current and future regulations affecting our products and business operations worldwide could cause us significant expense and adversely impact our business.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions and Operating a Global Business\n\u2022We generate a substantial portion of our revenue internationally.\n\u2022Adverse conditions in the global economy may significantly harm our revenue, profitability, and results of operations.\n\u2022We are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies.\nFinancial, Tax, and Accounting Risks\n\u2022We believe that our current level of cash and cash equivalents, together with committed financing facilities, are not sufficient to fund ongoing operations for at least the twelve-month period after the financial statements were issued. The existence of these conditions raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d for at least the twelve-month period following the date the financial statements were issued.\n\u2022Our future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future.\n\u2022Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022We may not realize the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets.\n\u2022If we fail to comply with the covenants and other obligations under our debt facilities, the lenders may be able to accelerate amounts owed under the facilities and, in the case of our Credit Facility (as defined herein), may foreclose upon the assets securing our obligations.\n\u2022We are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions.\n\u2022We have a significant amount of outstanding indebtedness.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\n\u2022Our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology is uncertain.\n\u2022We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and proprietary rights.\n\u2022We may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets.\n\u2022We depend on certain technologies that are licensed to us.\n\u2022We are subject to certain manufacturing restrictions related to licensed technologies that were developed with the financial assistance of U.S. governmental grants.\n\u2022We are subject to certain obligations and restrictions relating to technologies developed in cooperation with Canadian government agencies.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u2022Our stock price is volatile.\n\u2022Future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\n\u2022If securities or industry analysts publish unfavorable research about us or cease to cover our business, our stock price and/or trading volume could decline.\n\u2022Any conversions of our 2014 Notes or 2019 Notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT ISSUANCE\nThe pending strategic Private Placement Issuance may not be consummated or may be delayed, and any failure to complete the Private Placement Issuance could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, growth prospects and/or stock price.\nAs further described in Item 1, Business, we entered into (i) the Casdin Loan Agreement and (ii) the Viking Loan Agreement (the Bridge Loan Agreements). Each Bridge Loan Agreement provides for a Bridge Loan of $12.5 million to the Company. The Bridge Loans were fully drawn on January 24, 2022.\nAlso, as further described in Item 1, Business, on January 23, 2022, we entered into separate Purchase Agreements with each of the Purchasers, pursuant to which, among other things, at the Closing, and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the Company will issue and sell in a private placement (a) to Casdin, 112,500 shares of the Company\u2019s newly designated Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock in exchange for $112.5 million, and (b) to Viking, 112,500 shares of the Company\u2019s newly designated Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock in exchange for $112.5 million.\nConsummation of the Private Placement Issuance is subject to certain closing conditions, a number of which are not within our control, including stockholder approval of the Private Placement Issuance. We cannot predict with certainty whether or when any of the required closing conditions will be satisfied, and we can provide no assurance that all closing conditions will be satisfied or waived (where permissible) or that the Private Placement Issuance will be consummated timely or at all. Any failure to satisfy the closing conditions may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion of the Private Placement Issuance. If the Private Placement Issuance is not consummated, our ongoing business and financial results may be materially adversely affected and we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022the Purchase Agreements may be terminated;\n\u2022we may be unable to meet our debt maintenance or repayment obligations\u037e\n\u2022we may lose the anticipated benefits of the Private Placement Issuance and access to the relationships and expertise of the Purchasers, which could negatively impact our financial results, growth prospects and strategic plans\u037e\n\u2022our management may be required to divert attention from our business in order to negotiate an alternative transaction;\n\u2022we will be liable for significant transaction costs, including legal, accounting, financial advisory and other costs relating to the Private Placement Issuance; and\n\u2022we may be required to pay termination fees as required under the Purchase Agreements.\nIn addition, if the Private Placement Issuance is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our existing stockholders, customers, partners, employees, vendors and creditors. The trading price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price for our common stock reflects a market assumption that the Private Placement Issuance will be completed. We may be unable to find a comparable alternative transaction that would allow us to meet our debt and other obligations as they come due, which could have important consequences, including potentially forcing us into bankruptcy or liquidation. These risks may materialize and may adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, as well as the price of our common stock.\nLitigation relating to the Private Placement Issuance may be filed that could prevent or delay the Private Placement Issuance closing and/or result in the payment of damages.\nIn connection with the Private Placement Issuance, it is possible that stockholders or other parties may file putative class action or other lawsuits against us or the Purchasers. Among other remedies, these parties could seek damages and/or to enjoin the Special Meeting. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain, and any such potential lawsuits could prevent or delay the Closing of the Private Placement Issuance and/or result in substantial costs to us. Any such actions may create uncertainty relating to the Private Placement Issuance and may be costly and distracting to management. Further, the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the Private Placement Issuance is completed may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, in connection with the announcement of the Private Placement Issuance, we entered into an indemnification agreement with Dr. Egholm for indemnification with respect to potential claims by a prior employer against Dr. Egholm that may arise in connection with his engagement with us and becoming our Chief Executive Officer. We are currently responding to certain inquiries that a prior employer has made in connection with Dr. Egholm\u2019s signed offer letter to become our Chief\nExecutive Officer. Any claims for indemnification made by Dr. Egholm could cause us to incur costs and expenses. To the extent that we expend funds to indemnify Dr. Egholm, those funds will be unavailable for other purposes.\nWhile the Private Placement Issuance is pending, we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could harm our business relationships, financial condition, operating results and business.\nDuring the period prior to the Closing of the Private Placement Issuance and pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreements, we are exposed to certain inherent risks and contractual restrictions that could harm our business relationships, financial condition, operating results, and business, including:\n\u2022potential uncertainty in the marketplace, which could lead current and prospective customers to purchase products and services from other providers or delay purchasing from us;\n\u2022difficulties maintaining existing and/or establishing new business relationships, including business relationships with significant customers, suppliers and partners;\n\u2022the possibility of disruption to our business and operations resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Private Placement Issuance, including diversion of management attention and resources;\n\u2022the inability to attract and retain key personnel and recruit prospective employees, and the possibility that our current employees could be distracted, and their productivity decline as a result, due to uncertainty regarding the Private Placement Issuance;\n\u2022the inability to pursue alternative business opportunities or make changes to our business pending the completion of the Private Placement Issuance, and other restrictions on our ability to conduct our business;\n\u2022our inability to take certain actions that we might believe are beneficial for our business;\n\u2022the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Purchase Agreements and the Private Placement Issuance, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition; and\n\u2022other developments beyond our control, including, but not limited to, changes in domestic or global economic conditions, that may affect the timing or success of the Private Placement Issuance.\nIf any one or more of these effects were to occur, they could materially and adversely impact our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition, as well as the market price of our common stock and our perceived value, regardless of whether the Private Placement Issuance is completed.\nThe Purchase Agreements limit our ability to pursue alternatives to the Private Placement Issuance.\nThe Purchase Agreements contain certain customary restrictions on our ability to solicit proposals from third parties for alternative transactions, including a strategic investment or a sale of the Company. In addition, subject to certain customary \u201cfiduciary out\u201d exceptions, our board of directors is required to recommend that our stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the Private Placement Issuance. In connection with termination of the Purchase Agreements under specified circumstances, we will be obligated to pay each Purchaser a termination fee of up to $5,000,000. Moreover, we may be required to reimburse each Purchaser for an amount not to exceed $1,250,000 for each Purchaser\u2019s documented expenses if the Purchase Agreements are terminated for any reason other than the applicable Purchaser\u2019s breach of its Purchase Agreement. The payment of these fees and expenses could materially and adversely impact our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition.\nThese provisions might discourage an otherwise-interested third party from considering or proposing an alternative transaction, including a transaction that may be deemed to offer greater value to our stockholders than the Private Placement Issuance.\nActions of activist stockholders or other parties may impair our ability to consummate the Private Placement Issuance or otherwise could negatively impact our business.\nActions taken by activist stockholders could impair our ability to satisfy conditions to the consummation of the Private Placement Issuance, including receiving the requisite stockholder approval, or otherwise preclude us from consummating the Private Placement Issuance. Such activist stockholders could also take actions that disrupt our business, divert the time and attention of management and our employees away from our business operations, cause us to incur substantial additional expense, create perceived uncertainties among current and potential customers, clients, suppliers, employees and other constituencies as to our future direction as a consequence thereof, which may result in lost sales or other business arrangements and the loss of potential business opportunities, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. Actions that our board of directors has taken, and may take in the future, in response to any offer or proposal by activist stockholders may result in litigation against us, which could also be a significant distraction for our management and\nemployees and may require us to incur significant costs or otherwise result in an adverse effect on us. In addition, actual or perceived actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nWe have incurred, and will incur, substantial expenses in connection with the Private Placement Issuance.\nWe have incurred, and will incur, substantial expenses in connection with and as a result of the Private Placement Issuance, including financial advisory, legal, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees and expenses. A portion of the costs related to the Private Placement Issuance will be incurred regardless of whether the Private Placement Issuance is completed. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. Some of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses will exceed the costs historically borne by us and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations prior to and following the Private Placement Issuance.\nFollowing the Closing, the Purchasers will own a significant portion of our total outstanding voting securities and may prevent other stockholders from influencing material corporate decisions following completion of the Private Placement Issuance, and the Purchasers\u2019 interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nAssuming the Closing occurs on April 1, 2022 (the Assumed Closing Date), the Series B Preferred Stock will initially be convertible into up to approximately 75,157,929 shares of our common stock (without giving effect to limitations associated with any conversion cap), including any shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock issued upon conversion of the Bridge Loans. On an as-converted basis, we expect this to collectively represent approximately 49.4% of our issued and outstanding common stock immediately following the Closing (equating to approximately 24.7% per Purchaser) based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of January 31, 2022, but assuming full conversion of all Series B Preferred Stock (without giving effect to limitations associated with any conversion cap) immediately following the Assumed Closing Date. As a result, the Purchasers are expected to be our largest stockholders. This concentration of ownership, together with the voting rights, director designation rights and consent rights granted to the Purchasers as part of the Private Placement Issuance, may be perceived negatively by other investors and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The Purchasers, if they acted together, could significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. The interests of the Purchasers may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders.\nWe may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the Private Placement Issuance, and we will be subject to business uncertainties that could adversely affect our business.\nThe anticipated benefits of the Private Placement Issuance, including, among others: (i) to capitalize Fluidigm appropriately; (ii) to avoid frequently recurring liquidity concerns that temper stock price performance; (iii) to manage operating expenses; (iv) to find new sources of growth both organic and inorganic; and (v) to implement management changes as necessary to achieve the foregoing may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than we currently expect. Additionally, the Purchasers are preeminent investors in the life sciences market, and the Company may not realize the benefits from their domain experience and success in building growth companies in life sciences. Actual operating, strategic and revenue opportunities, if achieved at all, may be less significant than we expect or may take longer to achieve than we anticipate. If we are not able to achieve these objectives and realize the anticipated benefits from the Private Placement Issuance within the anticipated timing or at all, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected. Parties with whom we do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Private Placement Issuance. Our business relationships may be subject to disruption as customers, partners, vendors, landlords and other parties with whom we do business may attempt to delay or defer entering into new business relationships with us, negotiate changes in existing business relationships, terminate their contracts with us, or consider entering into business relationships with our competitors following the Private Placement Issuance. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our operating results, particularly during the period immediately following the Closing. Uncertainty about the effect of the Private Placement Issuance could also have an adverse effect on our employee relations. This uncertainty may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Private Placement Issuance is consummated and for a period of time thereafter. Any loss of key personnel, including members of our senior management team, could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nThe Private Placement Issuance, if consummated, will cause dilution to our current stockholders, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf our stockholders approve the Private Placement Issuance, upon the Closing, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the B-1 Purchase Agreement and Casdin Loan Agreement will initially be convertible into an aggregate of\napproximately 37,578,964 shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment), and the Series B-2 Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the B-2 Purchase Agreement and Viking Loan Agreement will initially be convertible into an aggregate of approximately 37,578,964 shares of our Common Stock (subject to adjustment), assuming the Closing occurs on the Assumed Closing Date, and without giving effect to limitations associated with any conversion cap. On an as-converted basis, and assuming the Closing occurs on the Assumed Closing Date, we currently expect this to represent an aggregate of approximately 49.4% of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately following the Closing (equating to approximately 24.7% per Purchaser) based on the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of January 31, 2022, but assuming full conversion of all Series B Preferred Stock (without giving effect to limitations associated with any conversion cap) immediately following the Closing. In connection with the Closing of the Private Placement Issuance, we also intend to adopt a 2022 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201cInducement Plan\u201d). The initial share reserve under the Inducement Plan is estimated to be 5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock at the Closing, calculated on a fully diluted basis (assuming all equity awards to be granted in connection with the Closing are outstanding). As a result, our current stockholders will experience substantial dilution of any earnings per share we may have in the future, as well as of ownership percentage and voting rights. This could have the effect of depressing the market price of our common stock.\nThe market value of our common stock could decline if the Purchasers sell their Series B Preferred Stock or common stock after certain transfer restrictions expire or if our current stockholders sell large amounts of common stock following the Private Placement Issuance.\nPursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement that we entered into on January 23, 2022 with the Purchasers, we agreed to certain customary registration rights with respect to shares issuable under the Bridge Loan Agreements and the Purchase Agreements, including (i) any shares of common stock acquired by any Purchaser pursuant to the conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock in accordance with the Certificates of Designations, (ii) common stock issued upon conversion of the Bridge Loans if no Series B Preferred Stock is issued in accordance with the Bridge Loan Agreements and (iii) any shares of common stock acquired by any Purchaser pursuant to preemptive rights under the Purchase Agreements, which means that such shares would become eligible for resale in the public markets following the expiration of any applicable transfer restrictions. Any sale of such shares, or the anticipation of the possibility of such sales, could create downward pressure on the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, our current stockholders may decide to reduce their investment in us due to the changes to our investment profile as a result of the Private Placement Issuance, and may sell large amounts of common stock leading up to or following the Private Placement Issuance. Such sales of our common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price of our common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, INDUSTRY, AND STRATEGY\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected our business operations and could continue to adversely impact our financial position and cash flows to an extent that is unknown and difficult to predict.\nThe pandemic and international public health emergency caused by SARS-CoV-2, the novel strain of coronavirus that causes the disease commonly known as COVID-19, has adversely affected all the countries in which we and our customers, suppliers, and other business partners operate, disrupting supply chains, causing significant volatility in global financial markets, and raising the prospect of an extended global recession. Public health problems resulting from COVID-19 and precautionary measures instituted by governments and businesses to mitigate its spread and resurgence, including travel restrictions and quarantines, could continue to contribute to a general slowdown in the global economy, cause increasingly adverse impacts on our customers, suppliers, and other business partners, and further disrupt our operations. Changes in our operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in inefficiencies and delays, including in sales and product development efforts, and additional costs related to business continuity initiatives that cannot be fully mitigated through succession planning, employees working remotely, or teleconferencing technologies.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental and societal reactions have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business, liquidity, results of operations, and stock price due to the occurrence of some or all of the following events or circumstances among others:\n\u2022reduced demand for some of our products and services due to the impact of COVID-19 on our customers, including in the global academic research community;\n\u2022the negative impact of ongoing travel restrictions and social distancing policies on our sales operations, marketing efforts, and customer field support;\n\u2022diminished business productivity due to inefficiencies in employees working from home or increasing physical distancing and other pandemic response protocols in our production facilities;\n\u2022increased voluntary turnover, together with impaired ability to hire and effectively train new personnel due to labor shortages, travel restrictions, and physical distancing protocols;\n\u2022increased susceptibility to the risk of information technology security breaches and other disruptions due to increased volumes of remote access to our information systems from our employees working at home;\n\u2022increased operating costs if one of our facilities were to experience a COVID-19 outbreak;\n\u2022disruption of the operations of our contract manufacturers, suppliers, and other business partners;\n\u2022shortages or delays in the supply of components and materials used in our products; and\n\u2022increased volatility in our stock price due to financial market instability.\nIn addition to its negative impact on some aspects of our business, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a source of opportunity for our diagnostics business, opening up external funding sources to support innovation and product development and resulting in increased revenues due to sales of our Advanta Dx SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test and related sales of our microfluidics instruments. However, as vaccines and alternative testing options for the coronavirus have become available and the perceived threat of the pandemic has receded, the demand for our COVID-19 testing products has slowed, resulting in a corresponding decline in related revenue.\nIn 2021, factors such as supply chain constraints, China trade restrictions, and the ongoing slowdown in the Asia-Pacific region caused our overall revenues to decline more than expected. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the continued spread and resurgences of the coronavirus; the emergence of new strains of the disease, such as the Delta and Omicron variants; the availability, efficacy, and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines; the scope and duration of the public health emergency; and COVID-19 mitigation measures such as travel bans and restrictions, social distancing, quarantines, and business shutdowns and closures.\nBecause the severity, magnitude, and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain, we are unable to predict the impact of COVID-19 on our operations, our financial performance, and our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and initiatives. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: governmental, business, and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions on travel, transport and workforce pressures); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; the availability of federal, state, local or non-U.S. funding programs; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; labor and materials shortages; supply chain difficulties, including disruption of logistics, shipping, and other distribution operations; and the pace of recovery when the threat of COVID-19 subsides.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our operating and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in our other risk factors below. COVID-19 may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not expect to present significant risks to our operations or financial results, particularly if the pandemic and its associated impacts reoccur in the coming months.\nOur financial results and revenue growth rates have varied significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year due to a number of factors, and a significant variance in our operating results or rates of growth from our financial guidance or market expectations, if any, could lead to substantial volatility in our stock price.\nOur revenue, results of operations, and revenue growth rates have varied in the past and may continue to vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. We may experience substantial variability in our product mix from period-to-period as revenue from sales of our instruments relative to sales of our consumables may fluctuate or deviate significantly from expectations. Although our revenue increased year-over-year in 2020 compared to 2019 and in 2019 compared to 2018, we experienced a year-over-year decline in revenue in 2021 compared to 2020, and we may be similarly unable to achieve revenue growth in future periods. Variability in our quarterly or annual results of operations, mix of product revenue, including any decline in our revenue related to the COVID-19 pandemic, or variability in rates of revenue growth, if any, may lead to volatility in our stock price as research analysts and investors respond to these fluctuations. These fluctuations are due to numerous factors that are difficult to forecast, including:\n\u2022fluctuations in demand for our products;\n\u2022changes in customer budget cycles, capital spending, and the availability of VAT and import tax exemptions;\n\u2022seasonal variations in customer operations;\n\u2022tendencies among some customers to defer purchase decisions to the end of the quarter;\n\u2022the large unit value of our systems, particularly our proteomics systems;\n\u2022changes in our pricing and sales policies or the pricing and sales policies of our competitors;\n\u2022our ability to design, manufacture, market, sell, and deliver products to our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u2022our ability to timely obtain adequate quantities of the materials or components used in our products, which in certain cases are purchased through sole and single source suppliers;\n\u2022staffing shortages, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover, and competitive job markets;\n\u2022fluctuations or reductions in revenue from sales of legacy instruments that may have contributed significant revenue in prior periods;\n\u2022quality control or yield problems in our manufacturing operations;\n\u2022new product introductions and enhancements by us and our competitors;\n\u2022unanticipated increases in costs or expenses;\n\u2022our complex, variable and, at times, lengthy sales cycle;\n\u2022trade restrictions and government protectionism;\n\u2022global economic conditions; and\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nAdditionally, we have certain customers who have historically placed large orders in multiple quarters during a calendar year. A significant reduction in orders from one or more of these customers could adversely affect our revenue and operating results, and if these customers defer or cancel purchases or otherwise alter their purchasing patterns, our financial results and actual results of operations could be significantly impacted. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results.\nThe foregoing factors, as well as other factors, could materially and adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations and rates of revenue growth, if any. We have experienced significant revenue growth in the past but we may not achieve similar growth rates in future periods. You should not rely on our operating results for any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future operating performance. If we are unable to achieve adequate revenue growth, our operating results could suffer and our stock price could decline. In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed due to our manufacturing, research and development, and sales and general administrative efforts. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a shortfall relative to our anticipated revenue could magnify the adverse impact of such shortfalls on our results of operations. We expect that our sales will continue to fluctuate on an annual and quarterly basis and that our financial results for some periods may be below those projected by securities analysts, which could significantly decrease the price of our common stock.\nWe have incurred losses since inception, and we may continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred significant losses in each fiscal year since our inception, including net losses of $59.2 million, $53.0 million, and $64.8 million during the years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $736.0 million. These losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in our research and development programs, and from our manufacturing costs and selling, general, and administrative expenses. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through equity offerings, the issuance of debt instruments, and from sales of our products. Until we are able to generate additional revenue to support our level of operating expenses, we will continue to incur operating and net losses and negative cash flow from operations.\nWe believe that our continued investment in research and development, sales, and marketing is essential to our long-term competitive position and future revenue growth and, as a result, we may incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability.\nThe life science markets are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and we may not be able to successfully compete.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changes in customer needs, emerging competition, new product introductions, and strong price competition. We compete with both established and development stage life science research companies that design, manufacture, and market instruments and consumables for gene expression analysis, single-cell targeted gene expression and protein expression analysis, SNP genotyping, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), digital PCR, flow cytometry, tissue imaging, and additional\napplications using well established laboratory techniques, as well as newer technologies such as bead encoded arrays, microfluidics, next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS), microdroplets, spatial protein expression, and photolithographic arrays. Most of our current competitors have significantly greater name recognition, greater financial and human resources, broader product lines and product packages, larger sales forces, larger existing installed bases, larger intellectual property portfolios, and greater experience and scale in research and development, manufacturing, and marketing than we do.\nWe consider Agilent Technologies, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (Thermo), Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., NanoString Technologies, Inc. (NanoString), and Agena Bioscience, Inc. to be our principal competitors in the microfluidics space. We believe that Cytek Biosciences, Inc. and Becton, Dickinson and Company are currently our principal competitors for our mass cytometry market share, and that IonPath Inc., Akoya Biosciences, Inc., NanoString, and 10x Genomics, Inc. are our principal competitors for our Imaging Mass Cytometry\u2122 market share. While the aforementioned principal competitors are the largest and most prevalent in their representative technology areas, the combined markets in which we compete have an additional 10 to 20 smaller competitors with competing approaches and technologies that we routinely face in selling situations.\nCompetitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or customer requirements. In light of these advantages, even if our technology is more effective than the product or service offerings of our competitors, current or potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our technology. We anticipate that we will continue to face increased competition in the future as existing companies and competitors develop new or improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies. Increased competition is likely to result in pricing pressures, which could reduce our profit margins and increase our sales and marketing expenses. In addition, mergers, consolidations, or other strategic transactions between two or more of our competitors, or between our competitor and one of our key customers, could change the competitive landscape and weaken our competitive position, adversely affecting our business.\nIf our research and product development efforts do not result in commercially viable products within anticipated timelines, if at all, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOur business is dependent on the improvement of our existing products, our development of new products to serve existing markets, and our development of new products to create new markets and applications that were previously not practical with existing systems. We intend to devote significant personnel and financial resources to research and development activities designed to advance the capabilities of our technology. We have developed design rules for the implementation of our technology that are frequently revised to reflect new insights we have gained about the technology. In addition, we have discovered that biological or chemical reactions sometimes behave differently when implemented on our systems rather than in a standard laboratory environment. Furthermore, many such reactions take place within the confines of single cells, which have also demonstrated unexpected behavior when grown and manipulated within microfluidic environments. As a result, research and development efforts may be required to transfer certain reactions and cell handling techniques to our systems. In the past, product development projects have been significantly delayed when we encountered unanticipated difficulties in implementing a process on our systems. We may have similar delays in the future, and we may not obtain any benefits from our research and development activities. Any delay or failure by us to develop and release new products or product enhancements would have a substantial adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nMarket opportunities may not develop as quickly as we expect, limiting our ability to successfully sell our products, or our product development and strategic plans may change and our entry into certain markets may be delayed, if it occurs at all.\nThe application of our technologies to high-throughput genomics, single-cell genomics and, particularly, mass cytometry applications are in many cases emerging market opportunities. We believe these opportunities will take several years to develop or mature and we cannot be certain that these market opportunities will develop as we expect. The future growth of our markets and the success of our products depend on many factors beyond our control, including recognition and acceptance by the scientific community, and the growth, prevalence, and costs of competing methods of genetic and protein analysis. Additionally, our success depends on the ability of our sales organization to successfully sell our products into these new markets. If we are not able to successfully market and sell our products, or to achieve the revenue or margins we expect, our operating results may be harmed and we may not recover our product development and marketing expenditures. In addition, our product development and strategic plans may change, which could delay or impede our entry into these markets.\nOur future success is dependent upon our ability to expand our customer base and introduce new applications.\nOur customer base is primarily composed of academic research institutions, translational research and medicine centers, cancer centers, clinical research laboratories, biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, and plant and animal research companies, and contract research organizations that perform analyses for research and commercial purposes. Our success will depend, in part,\nupon our ability to increase our market share among these customers, attract additional customers outside of these markets, and market new applications to existing and new customers as we develop such applications. Attracting new customers and introducing new applications require substantial time and expense. For example, it may be difficult to identify, engage, and market to customers who are unfamiliar with the current applications of our systems. Any failure to expand our existing customer base or launch new applications would adversely affect our ability to increase our revenue.\nIf our products fail to achieve and sustain sufficient market acceptance, our revenue will be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to develop and market products that are recognized and accepted as reliable, enabling and cost-effective. Most of our potential customers already use expensive research systems in their laboratories and may be reluctant to replace those systems. Market acceptance of our systems will depend on many factors, including our ability to convince potential customers that our systems are an attractive alternative to existing technologies. Compared to some competing technologies, our technology is relatively new, and most potential customers have limited knowledge of, or experience with, our products. Prior to adopting our systems, some potential customers may need to devote time and effort to testing and validating our systems. Any failure of our systems to meet these customer benchmarks could result in customers choosing to retain their existing systems or to purchase systems other than ours, and revenue from the sale of legacy instruments that may have contributed significant revenue in prior periods may decrease.\nIn addition, it is important that our systems be perceived as accurate and reliable by the scientific and medical research community as a whole. Historically, a significant part of our sales and marketing efforts has been directed at convincing industry leaders of the advantages of our systems and encouraging such leaders to publish or present the results of their evaluation of our system. If we are unable to continue to induce leading researchers to use our systems, or if such researchers are unable to achieve and publish or present significant experimental results using our systems, acceptance and adoption of our systems will be slowed and our ability to increase our revenue would be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to develop new products or enhance the capabilities of our existing systems to keep pace with rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur success depends on our ability to develop new products and applications for our technology in existing and new markets, while improving the performance and cost-effectiveness of our systems. New technologies, techniques, or products could emerge that might offer better combinations of price and performance than our current or future product lines and systems. Existing markets for our products, including high-throughput genomics, single-cell genomics and mass cytometry, as well as potential markets for our products such as high-throughput NGS and molecular applications, are characterized by rapid technological change and innovation. It is critical to our success for us to anticipate changes in technology and customer requirements and to successfully introduce new, enhanced, and competitive technology to meet our customers\u2019 and prospective customers\u2019 needs on a timely and cost-effective basis. Developing and implementing new technologies will require us to incur substantial development costs and we may not have adequate resources available to be able to successfully introduce new applications of, or enhancements to, our systems. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain technological advantages over emerging technologies in the future. While we typically plan improvements to our systems, we may not be able to successfully implement these improvements. If we fail to keep pace with emerging technologies, demand for our systems will not grow and may decline, and our business, revenue, financial condition, and operating results could suffer materially. In addition, if we introduce enhanced systems but fail to manage product transitions effectively, customers may delay or forgo purchases of our systems and our operating results may be adversely affected by product obsolescence and excess inventory. Even if we successfully implement some or all of these planned improvements, we cannot guarantee that our current and potential customers will find our enhanced systems to be an attractive alternative to existing technologies, including our current products.\nOur efficiency and cost-savings initiatives could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we have implemented efficiency and cost-savings initiatives intended to stabilize our business operations. These efficiency initiatives have included targeted workforce reductions, optimizing our facilities, and reducing excess space. In 2020, in response to the uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, we initiated a range of additional actions aimed at temporarily reducing our operating expenses and preserving liquidity, including implementing temporary enterprise-wide salary reductions of 20% for employees at or above the \u2018director\u2019 level and 10% for all others, temporarily reducing our board members\u2019 cash retainers by 20%, and constraining hiring. Although we discontinued our hiring constraints and pandemic-related pay reductions in 2020, we regularly review other possible actions to preserve liquidity and optimize our organization. For example, we may need to decrease or defer capital expenditures and development activities or implement further operating expense reduction measures. The implementation of these and other efficiency and cost-savings initiatives\ncould impair our ability to invest in developing, marketing and selling new and existing products, be disruptive to our operations, make it difficult to attract or retain employees, result in higher than anticipated charges, divert the attention of management, result in a loss of accumulated knowledge, impact our customer and supplier relationships, and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we seek to implement a company-wide enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, such implementation could adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are considering implementing a company-wide ERP system to handle the business and financial processes within our operations and corporate functions. ERP implementations are complex and time-consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities that can continue for several years. ERP implementations also require transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the ERP system. If we decide to implement a company-wide ERP system, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we experience operating problems and/or cost overruns during the ERP implementation process, or if the ERP system and the associated process changes do not give rise to the benefits that we expect. If we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or if the system does not operate as intended, our business, results of operations, and internal controls over financial reporting could be adversely affected.\nOur business growth strategy involves the potential for significant acquisitions, and our operating results and prospects could be harmed if we are unable to integrate future acquisitions successfully.\nWe may acquire other businesses to improve our product offerings or expand into new markets. Our future acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete, and integrate acquisitions and, if necessary, to obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing to fund those acquisitions. Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky, and any transaction we complete may not be successful. Any merger or acquisition we may pursue would involve numerous risks, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022difficulties in integrating and managing the operations, technologies, and products of the companies we acquire;\n\u2022diversion of our management\u2019s attention from normal daily operation of our business;\n\u2022our inability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022our inability to retain key personnel of the acquired company;\n\u2022uncertainty of entry into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u2022our dependence on unfamiliar affiliates and customers of the companies we acquire;\n\u2022insufficient revenue to offset our increased expenses associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022our responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire, including those which we may not anticipate;\n\u2022the possibility that we may not realize the value of acquired assets recorded as goodwill or intangible assets, and would be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets; and\n\u2022our inability to maintain internal standards, controls, procedures, and policies.\nWe may be unable to secure the equity or debt funding necessary to finance future acquisitions on terms that are acceptable to us. If we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders will likely experience dilution, and if we finance future acquisitions with debt funding, we will incur interest expense and may have to comply with financial covenants and secure that debt obligation with our assets.\nRISKS RELATED TO OPERATIONS AND RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES\nWe may experience development or manufacturing problems or delays that could limit the potential growth of our revenue or increase our losses.\nWe may encounter unforeseen situations in the manufacturing and assembly of our products that would result in delays or shortfalls in our production. For example, our production processes and assembly methods may have to change to accommodate any significant future expansion of our manufacturing capacity, which may increase our manufacturing costs, delay production of our products, reduce our product margin, and adversely impact our business. Conversely, if demand for our products shifts such that a manufacturing facility is operated below its capacity for an extended period, we may adjust our manufacturing operations to reduce fixed costs, which could lead to uncertainty and delays in manufacturing times and quality during any transition period.\nAdditionally, all of our integrated fluidic circuits (IFCs) for commercial sale are manufactured at our facility in Singapore. Production of the elastomeric block that is at the core of our IFCs is a complex process requiring advanced clean rooms, sophisticated equipment, and strict adherence to procedures. Any contamination of the clean room, equipment malfunction, or failure to strictly follow procedures can significantly reduce our yield in one or more batches. We have in the past experienced variations in yields due to such factors. A drop in yield can increase our cost to manufacture our IFCs or, in more severe cases, require us to halt the manufacture of our IFCs until the problem is resolved. Identifying and resolving the cause of a drop in yield can require substantial time and resources.\nFurthermore, developing an IFC for a new application may require developing a specific production process for that type of IFC. While all of our IFCs are produced using the same basic processes, significant variations may be required to ensure adequate yield of any particular type of IFC. Developing such a process can be time consuming, and any unexpected difficulty in doing so can delay the introduction of a product.\nIf our manufacturing activities are adversely impacted, or if we are otherwise unable to keep up with demand for our products by successfully manufacturing, assembling, testing, and shipping our products in a timely manner, our revenue could be impaired, market acceptance for our products could be adversely affected and our customers might instead purchase our competitors\u2019 products.\nOur business depends on research and development spending levels of our customers, a reduction in which could limit our ability to sell our products and adversely affect our business.\nWe expect that our revenue in the foreseeable future will continue to be derived primarily from sales of our systems, IFCs, assays, and reagents to academic research institutions, translational research and medicine centers, cancer centers, clinical research laboratories biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, and plant and animal research companies, and contract research organizations worldwide. Our success will depend upon their demand for and use of our products. Accordingly, the spending policies and practices of these customers-which have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and may additionally be impacted by other factors-have had and will continue to have a significant effect on the demand for our technology. These policies may be based on a wide variety of factors, including concerns regarding any future federal government budget sequestrations, the availability of resources to make purchases, the spending priorities among various types of equipment, policies regarding spending during recessionary periods, tariffs and trade restrictions, and changes in the political climate. In addition, academic, governmental, and other research institutions that fund research and development activities may be subject to stringent budgetary constraints that could result in spending reductions, reduced allocations, or budget cutbacks, which could jeopardize the ability of these customers to purchase our products. Our operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by our customers. For example, reductions in operating expenditures by global academic research facilities because of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in lower than expected sales of our mass cytometry instruments. Additionally, the imposition of tariffs and delays in issuing VAT and import tax exemptions have adversely affected the sales of our products in China. Similar reductions and delays in customer spending have resulted and may continue to result from other factors that are not within our control, such as:\n\u2022changes in economic conditions;\n\u2022natural disasters or public health crises;\n\u2022changes in government programs that provide funding to research institutions and companies;\n\u2022macroeconomic conditions and the political climate;\n\u2022governmental protectionism, the escalation of tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022availability of tax permits and incentives, including VAT and import tax exemptions;\n\u2022changes in the regulatory environment affecting life science and plant and animal research companies engaged in research and commercial activities;\n\u2022changes in our customers\u2019 research priorities;\n\u2022differences in budget cycles across various geographies and industries;\n\u2022personnel shortages among our customers;\n\u2022market-driven pressures on companies to consolidate operations and reduce costs;\n\u2022mergers and acquisitions in the life science and plant and animal research industries; and\n\u2022other factors affecting research and development spending.\nAny decrease in our customers\u2019 budgets or expenditures or in the size, scope, or frequency of capital or operating expenditures, as well as any increase in local tariffs could materially and adversely affect our operations or financial condition.\nIf one or more of our manufacturing facilities become unavailable or inoperable, we will be unable to continue manufacturing our instruments, IFCs, assays and/or reagents and, as a result, our business will be harmed until we are able to secure a new facility.\nWe manufacture our microfluidics analytical and preparatory instruments and IFCs for commercial sale at our facility in Singapore and our mass cytometry instruments, assays, and reagents for commercial sale at our facility in Canada. No other manufacturing facilities are currently available to us, particularly facilities of the size and scope of our Singapore and Canada operations. Our facilities and the equipment we use to manufacture our instruments, IFCs, assays, and reagents would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead times to repair or replace. Our facilities may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to manufacture our products for some period of time. If any of our facilities become unavailable to us, we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to secure a new manufacturing facility on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to manufacture our products, combined with our limited inventory of manufactured supplies, may result in the loss of customers or harm our reputation, and we may be unable to reestablish relationships with those customers in the future. Although we possess insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If our manufacturing capabilities are impaired, we may not be able to manufacture and ship our products in a timely manner, which would adversely impact our business.\nDisruption of our manufacturing facilities or other operations, or in the operations of our customers or business partners, due to earthquake, flood, other natural catastrophic events, public health crises, or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders, delays in deliveries or other business activities, or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business.\nWe have significant manufacturing operations in Singapore and Canada and operations in the United States. In addition, our business is international in nature, with our sales, service and administrative personnel and our customers located in numerous countries throughout the world. Operations at our manufacturing facilities and our subcontractors, as well as our other operations and those of our customers, are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, public health crises (including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), fire, earthquake, volcanic eruptions, energy shortages, flooding, or other natural disasters. Such disruption could cause delays in, among other things, shipments of products to our customers, our ability to perform services requested by our customers, or the installation of our products at customer sites.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that alternate means of conducting our operations (whether through alternate production capacity or service providers or otherwise) would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that, if such alternate means were available, they could be obtained on favorable terms.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers for some of the components and materials used in our products, and the loss of any of these suppliers, or delays or problems in the supply of components and materials could harm our business.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers for certain components and materials used in our products, including single and sole source suppliers. Additionally, several of our instruments are assembled at the facilities of contract manufacturers in Singapore. We do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers of these components and materials or our assembly service providers. The loss of a single or sole source supplier of any of the following components and/or materials would require significant time and effort to locate and qualify an alternative source of supply, if at all:\n\u2022The IFCs used in our microfluidic systems are fabricated using a specialized polymer, and other specialized materials, that are available from a limited number of sources. In the past, we have encountered quality issues that have reduced our manufacturing yield or required the use of additional manufacturing processes.\n\u2022The electron multiplier detector included in the Hyperion/CyTOF systems and certain metal isotopes used with the Hyperion/CyTOF systems are purchased from sole source suppliers.\n\u2022The raw materials for our Delta Gene and SNP Type assays and Access Array target-specific primers are available from a limited number of sources.\nOur reliance on single and sole source suppliers and assembly service providers also subjects us to other risks that could harm our business, including the following:\n\u2022we may be subject to increased component or assembly costs and\n\u2022we may not be able to obtain adequate supply or services in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms.\nIn connection with the global supply chain disruptions following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced and are continuing to experience problems with some of our suppliers. In the third quarter of 2021, shortages of certain components caused a backlog and we were unable to fulfill all of the demand for our products during the quarter. We have in the past experienced supply issues, as well as quality control problems such as manufacturing errors, with some of our suppliers, and may again experience problems in the future. We may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers, particularly for our single source components, or assembly service providers. Any continued or future interruption or delay in the supply of components or materials or assembly of our instruments, or our inability to obtain components, materials, or assembly services from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to cancel orders or switch to competitive products, which would harm our business.\nWe may not be able to convert our orders in backlog into revenue.\nOur backlog represents product orders from our customers that we have confirmed but have not been able to fulfill, and, accordingly, for which we have not yet recognized revenue. We may not receive revenue from these orders, and any order backlog we report may not be indicative of our future revenue.\nMany events can cause an order to be delayed or not completed at all, some of which may be out of our control, including the potential impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and our suppliers not being able to provide us with products or components. If we delay fulfilling customer orders or if customers reconsider their orders, those customers may seek to cancel or modify their orders with us. Customers may otherwise seek to cancel or delay their orders even if we are prepared to fulfill them. If our orders in backlog do not result in sales, our operating results may suffer.\nAny disruption or delay in the shipping or off-loading of our products, whether domestically or internationally, may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on shipping providers to deliver products to our customers globally. Labor, tariff, or World Trade Organization-related disputes, piracy, physical damage to shipping facilities or equipment caused by severe weather or terrorist incidents, congestion at shipping facilities, complications related to public health crises (including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), inadequate equipment to load, dock, and offload our products, energy-related tie-ups, or other factors could disrupt or delay shipping or off-loading of our products domestically and internationally. Such disruptions or delays may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business operations depend upon the continuing efforts of our management team and other skilled and experienced personnel, and if we are unable to retain them or to recruit and train new key executives, scientists, and technical support personnel, we may be unable to achieve our goals.\nOur success depends largely on the skills, experience, and performance of our management team and scientific and technical support personnel. The loss of the services of certain members of our management team or our scientific or technical support staff might significantly delay or prevent the development of our products or achievement of other business objectives by diverting management\u2019s attention to transition matters and identification of suitable replacements, and staffing shortages could also negatively impact our ability to expand and scale functions that are needed to support the development of our products and the growth of our business. Our research and product development efforts could also be delayed or curtailed if we are unable to attract, train, and retain highly skilled employees, particularly, senior scientists and engineers. Competition for qualified senior management and key employees in our industry is intense. We have experienced increased turnover at all levels since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and general labor shortages in various areas of our business, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. We may need to increase employee wages and benefits in order to attract and retain the personnel necessary to achieve our goals, and our business, operations, and financial results may suffer if we are unable to do so. We do not maintain significant key person life insurance with any of our employees and all our employees, including our management team, may terminate employment without notice and without cause or good reason.\nAdditionally, to expand our research and product development efforts, we need to retain and recruit scientists skilled in areas such as molecular and cellular biology, assay development, engineering physics, and manufacturing. We also need highly trained technical support personnel with the necessary scientific background and ability to understand our systems at a technical level to effectively support potential new customers and the expanding needs of current customers. Competition for these people is intense and we may face challenges in retaining and recruiting such individuals if, for example, our stock price declines, reducing the retention value of equity awards, or our business or technology is no longer perceived as leading in our field. Because of the complex and technical nature of our systems and the dynamic market in which we compete, any failure to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially harm our ability to develop and commercialize our technology.\nIf we are unable to expand our direct sales, field support, and marketing forces or distribution capabilities to adequately address our customers\u2019 needs, our business will be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to market, sell, and, distribute our products effectively enough to support our planned growth. We sell our products primarily through our own sales force and through distributors in certain territories. Our future sales will depend in large part on our ability to continue to increase the scope of our marketing efforts and develop and substantially expand our direct sales force and field application specialist and service engineer teams. Our products are technically complex and used for highly specialized applications. As a result, we believe it is necessary to continue to develop a direct sales force that includes people with specific scientific backgrounds and expertise, and a marketing group with technical sophistication.\nIn the past year, we have experienced significant changes and increased turnover in our sales and marketing organizations, and we face considerable challenges in recruiting and training qualified replacements. Our future success will depend largely on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate the skilled sales and marketing force necessary to support our business activities, and any failure to maintain competitive levels of compensation will negatively impact our ability to so. Because competition for such employees is intense, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to retain them on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Failure to attract and retain our current personnel or to build an efficient and effective sales and marketing force would negatively impact sales of our products and reduce our revenue and profitability.\nIn addition, we may continue to enlist one or more sales representatives and distributors to assist with sales, distribution, and customer support globally or in certain regions of the world. If we do seek to enter into such arrangements, we may not be successful in attracting desirable sales representatives and distributors, or we may not be able to enter into such arrangements on favorable terms. If our sales and marketing efforts, or those of any third-party sales representatives and distributors, are not successful, our technologies and products may not gain market acceptance, which would materially and adversely impact our business operations.\nTo use our products-our Biomark, EP1, CyTOF, and Hyperion systems in particular-customers typically need to purchase specialized reagents. Any interruption in the availability of these reagents for use in our products could limit our ability to market our products.\nOur products, our Biomark, EP1, CyTOF, and Hyperion systems in particular, must be used in conjunction with one or more reagents designed to produce or facilitate the particular biological or chemical reaction desired by the user. Many of these reagents are highly specialized and available to the user only from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Although we sell reagents for use with certain of our products, our customers may purchase these reagents directly from third-party suppliers, and we have no control over the supply of those materials. In addition, our products are designed to work with these reagents as they are currently formulated. We have no control over the formulation of reagents sold by third-party suppliers, and the performance of our products might be adversely affected if the formulation of these reagents is changed. If one or more of these reagents were to become unavailable or were reformulated, our ability to market and sell our products could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, the use of a reagent for a particular process may be covered by one or more patents relating to the reagent itself, the use of the reagent for the particular process, the performance of that process, or the equipment required to perform the process. Typically, reagent suppliers, who are either the patent holders or their authorized licensees, sell the reagents along with a license or covenant not to sue with respect to such patents. The license accompanying the sale of a reagent often purports to restrict the purposes for which the reagent may be used. If a patent holder or authorized licensee were to assert against us or our customers that the license or covenant relating to a reagent precluded its use with our systems, our ability to sell and market our products could be materially and adversely affected. For example, our Biomark system involves real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technology. Leading suppliers of reagents for real-time qPCR reactions include Life Technologies Corporation (now part of Thermo) and Roche Diagnostics Corporation, who are our direct competitors, and their licensees. These real-time qPCR reagents are typically sold pursuant to limited licenses or covenants not to sue with respect to patents held by these companies. We do not have any contractual supply agreements for these real-time qPCR reagents, and we cannot assure you that these reagents will continue to be available to our customers for use with our systems, or that these patent holders will not seek to enforce their patents against us, our customers, or suppliers.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data, cyberattacks, and other information technology failures could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results.\nWe are dependent upon our data and information technology systems for the effective operation of our business and for the secure maintenance and storage of confidential data relating to our business and third-party businesses. Our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by experienced programmers or hackers who may be able to penetrate our security controls and deploy computer viruses, cyberattacks, phishing schemes, or other malicious software programs, or due to employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility\nfailures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate in preventing or responding to any of these circumstances. Any such compromise of our information technology systems could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information and unauthorized release of customer, supplier or employee data, any of which could expose us to a risk of legal claims or proceedings, liability under privacy or other laws, disruption of our operations and damage to our reputation, which could divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business and materially and adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. In addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches. The cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures, either as a response to specific breaches or as a result of evolving risks, could be significant. In addition, our inability to use or access our information systems at critical points in time could adversely affect the timely and efficient operation of our business. Any delayed sales, significant costs or lost customers resulting from these technology failures could adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results.\nWe have implemented security controls to protect our information technology infrastructure but, due to the ever-evolving nature of information security threats, we are not fully insulated from technology disruptions that could adversely impact us. For example, in early 2019, we experienced a ransomware attack that infiltrated and encrypted certain of our information technology systems, including systems containing critical business data. Immediately following the attack, actions were taken to recover the compromised systems and we were able to restore their operation without significant loss of business data within weeks. Based on the nature of the attack and its impact on our systems, we believe no confidential data was lost or disclosed. If, however, confidential data were determined to have been released in the course of any future event, it is possible that we could be the subject of actions by governmental authorities or claims from persons alleging they suffered damages from such a release. We believe our mitigation measures and expanded information security program have reduced, but cannot eliminate, the risk of a similar attack, and we anticipate additional work and expense in the future as we continuously improve our security processes and initiatives in response to ever-changing information security challenges.\nIn addition to risks affecting our own systems, we could also be negatively impacted by a data breach or cyber incident happening to a third party\u2019s network and affecting us. Third parties with which we conduct business have access to certain portions of our sensitive data, including information pertaining to our customers and employees. In the event that these third parties do not adequately safeguard our data, security breaches could result and negatively impact our business, operations, and financial results.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have an increased number of employees working remotely. As a result, we may have increased cyber security and data security risks, due to increased use of home wi-fi networks and virtual private networks, as well as increased disbursement of physical machines. While we have implemented security controls, updated our policies, and augmented our information security training program to reduce the risk of cyberattacks and security breaches, there is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard all systems with the increased number of employees working remotely.\nRISKS RELATED TO QUALITY AND THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\nOur products could have defects or errors, which may give rise to claims against us, adversely affect market adoption of our systems, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur systems utilize novel and complex technology and such systems may develop or contain undetected defects or errors. We cannot assure you that material performance problems, defects, or errors will not arise, and as we increase the density and integration of our systems, these risks may increase. We generally provide warranties that our systems will meet performance expectations and will be free from defects. The costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating margins. For example, we have experienced a performance issue with respect to certain IFCs used in our C1 systems due to the presence of more than one cell in an IFC chamber. Although we have redesigned such C1 IFCs, we may experience additional unexpected product defects or errors that could affect our ability to adequately address these performance issues.\nIn manufacturing our products, including our systems, IFCs, and assays, we depend upon third parties for the supply of various components, many of which require a significant degree of technical expertise to produce. In addition, we purchase certain products from third-party suppliers for resale. If our suppliers fail to produce components to specification or provide defective products to us for resale and our quality control tests and procedures fail to detect such errors or defects, or if we or our suppliers use defective materials or workmanship in the manufacturing process, the reliability and performance of our products will be compromised.\nIf our products contain defects, we may experience:\n\u2022a failure to achieve market acceptance or expansion of our product sales;\n\u2022loss of customer orders and delay in order fulfillment;\n\u2022damage to our brand reputation;\n\u2022increased cost of our warranty program due to product repair or replacement;\n\u2022product recalls or replacements;\n\u2022inability to attract new customers;\n\u2022diversion of resources from our manufacturing and research and development departments into our service department; and\n\u2022legal claims against us, including product liability claims, which could be costly and time consuming to defend and result in substantial damages.\nIn addition, certain of our products are marketed for use with products sold by third parties. For example, certain of our systems are marketed as compatible with major NGS instruments. If such third-party products are not produced to specification, are produced in accordance with modified specifications, or are defective, they may not be compatible with our products. In such case, the reliability and performance of our products may be compromised.\nThe occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlthough the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for our Advanta Dx SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Assay in August 2020 (which was updated for use with the AZOVA COVID-19 Test Collection Kit in February 2021, among other updates) and our Advanta Dx COVID-19 EASE Assay in February 2022, these authorizations are only valid during the COVID-19 public health emergency, and when the federally declared public health emergency ends, we will be required to stop commercial distribution of our assay and the collection kit immediately in the United States unless we comply with FDA requirements, which may include obtaining FDA clearance or approval for our assay under a traditional regulatory pathway for in vitro diagnostics, which is lengthy and expensive.\nUnder section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), the FDA has authority to allow certain unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used during a public health emergency under an EUA. In issuing an EUA, the FDA will consider the totality of scientific evidence available to the FDA regarding safety, efficacy and known and potential risks of such products and availability of alternatives to the emergency use products, among others. EUAs issued by the FDA will specify the scope of authorization and conditions of authorization, including limitations on distribution and conditions related to product advertising and promotion. Once granted, an EUA is effective until the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use is terminated under Section 564(b)(2) of the FD&C Act or the EUA is revoked under Section 564(g) of the FD&C Act, after which the product must be cleared or approved by the FDA under a traditional pathway as defined by the FDA and we must comply with the FDA quality system regulations in order to remain on the market or to continue commercialization of the product.\nIn August 2020, the FDA granted EUA for our Advanta Dx SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Assay for qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in saliva specimens from individuals suspected by their healthcare providers of having COVID-19, with the use of the assay limited to CLIA high complexity laboratories. Four supplements have been submitted and authorized as follows: S001 for addition of the FDA Reference Panel Results, S002 for software updates and labeling changes, S003 for addition of alternative source of targets and labeling updates, and S004 for addition of AZOVA home collection kit. In February 2021, the FDA updated that EUA for our Advanta Dx SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Assay for use with the AZOVA COVID-19 Test Collection Kit, which is authorized for self-collection of saliva specimens at home. In February 2022, we were granted EUA for our the Advanta Dx COVID-19 EASE Assay, which is authorized for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, mid-turbinate nasal swab, and anterior nasal swab specimens from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. As set forth in each EUA, we are required to comply with the conditions of authorization, including certain requirements pertaining to FDA notification, distribution, printed materials, advertising and promotion. If we, our distributors, or authorized laboratories do not comply with the EUA requirements, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted, and we may be subject to regulatory or enforcement actions, including recall of our products and the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, penalties, or fines, among other adverse actions.\nIf the FDA\u2019s policies and guidance change unexpectedly and/or materially or if we misinterpret them, potential sales of Advanta Dx SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and the AZOVA COVID-19 Test Collection Kit could be adversely impacted. In addition,\nthe FDA will revoke an EUA where it is determined that the underlying public health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization, or if new evidence becomes available that indicates the test does not meet the conditions of authorization or perform as provided in the EUA application. We cannot predict how long this EUA will remain effective. The termination or revocation of the EUA and changing policies and regulatory requirements could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The demand for our product and our profitability may decline or be adversely impacted by the federal government\u2019s implementation of a national COVID-19 testing strategy. Given the uncertain nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and future legislation and regulation in this space, we can provide no assurance with respect to our ability to achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations.\nWe compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as healthcare fraud and abuse, data privacy and medical product laws and regulations. The healthcare industry is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and United States federal, state and local laws and regulations. In addition, federal and state enforcement agencies have substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations under broad laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse, interactions and financial arrangements with healthcare professionals or entities, data privacy and misconduct involving government programs or contracts. If we, our employees, collaborators or contractors fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, and the loss of various licenses and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nOur contract with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) could expose us to unique risks and costs as an entity contracting with the federal government.\nThe NIH launched the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) program to expedite development, commercialization, and implementation of technologies for COVID-19 testing to help increase testing in the United States. In July 2020, we entered into a letter contract with the NIH for a project under the RADx program. The letter contract provided access to approximately $12.2 million of the total proposed funding for the project prior to execution of a further definitive contract for the project. In September 2020, we executed a definitive contract with the NIH as an amendment to the letter contract (collectively, the NIH Contract) to expand production capacity and throughput capabilities for COVID-19 testing with our microfluidics technology. Pursuant to the terms of the NIH Contract, the funding for the project was increased by approximately $22.0 million, for a total contract value of up to approximately $34.0 million. Release of funding under the NIH Contract is based on the achievement of milestones, including expansion of our manufacturing facilities, addition of production lines, and achieving full production capacity. As of December 31, 2021, all milestones have been achieved and accepted by NIH.\nWe must prioritize among many different opportunities, and we may expend our limited resources on programs that do not yield a successful or profitable product candidate and may forego other more profitable opportunities. Further, the Bayh-Dole Act applies to all NIH research and development funding granted to for-profit organizations, which requires the government to be provided a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States any subject invention throughout the world.\nThe NIH Contract includes certain provisions from the Federal Acquisition Regulations, some of which are customary or legally required, that give the U.S. government substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts. For example, the NIH Contract contains provisions permitting unilateral termination or modification, in whole or in part, at the convenience of the U.S. government. Under general principles of government contracting law, if the U.S. government terminates a contract for convenience, the government contractor may recover only its incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the U.S. government terminates a contract for default, the government contractor is entitled to recover costs incurred and associated profits on accepted items only and may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items from another source. In addition, government contracts normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include, for example, mandatory internal control systems and policies, mandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, non-discrimination and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements and public disclosures of certain contract information, which may enable competitors to gain insights into our research program. If we fail\nto maintain compliance with these requirements, we may be subject to potential contract or False Claims Act liability and to termination of our NIH Contract.\nOther examples of rights and remedies under the NIH Contract include provisions that allow NIH to:\n\u2022terminate the NIH Contract, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason;\n\u2022unilaterally reduce or modify the U.S. government\u2019s obligations under the NIH Contract, without our consent, including by imposing price adjustments;\n\u2022claim rights, including intellectual property rights, in or to (i) products, (ii) data, and (iii) facilities, in each case developed under the NIH Contract;\n\u2022under certain circumstances involving public health and safety, license inventions made under such agreements to third parties;\n\u2022suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;\n\u2022impose U.S. manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under the NIH Contract;\n\u2022suspend or debar us from doing future business with the government;\n\u2022change the course of a development program in a manner that differs from the NIH Contract\u2019s original terms or from our desired development plan, including decisions regarding our partners in the program;\n\u2022pursue civil or criminal remedies under the False Claims Act and False Statements Act; and\n\u2022control or prohibit the export of products.\nFurthermore, we may be required to enter into agreements and subcontracts with third parties, including suppliers, consultants and other third-party contractors in order to satisfy our contractual obligations pursuant to our agreements with the U.S. government. Negotiating and entering into such arrangements can be time-consuming and we may not be able to reach agreement with such third parties. Any such agreement must also be compliant with the terms of the NIH Contract. Any delay or inability to enter into such arrangements or entering into such arrangements in a manner that is non-compliant with the terms of our contract, may result in violations of our contract.\nU.S. government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors and recipients of federal grants and contracts (even after performance has been completed). These agencies review a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The audit may also include review of the adequacy of, and a contractor\u2019s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor\u2019s accounting, purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, which could cause our stock price to decrease.\nTo the extent we elect to label and promote any of our non-EUA products as medical devices, we would be required to obtain prior approval or clearance by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority, which could take significant time and expense and could fail to result in a marketing authorization for the intended uses we believe are commercially attractive. Obtaining marketing authorization in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining marketing authorization in other jurisdictions where we conduct business.\nExcept for the Advanta Dx SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Assay and the AZOVA COVID-19 Test Collection Kit authorized by the FDA under an EUA granted in August 2020 and updated in February 2021, among other updates, and our Advanta Dx COVID-19 EASE Assay authorized by the FDA under an EUA granted in February 2022, our other products are currently labeled, promoted and sold to academic research institutions, translational research and medicine centers, cancer centers, clinical research laboratories, contract research organizations, and biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, and plant and animal research companies as \u201cresearch use only\u201d (RUO), and are not designed, or intended to be used, for clinical diagnostic tests or as medical devices as currently marketed. If we elect to label and market our products for use as, or in the performance of, clinical diagnostics in the United States, thereby subjecting them to FDA regulation as medical devices, we would be required to obtain premarket 510(k) clearance or premarket approval from the FDA, unless an exception applies.\nWe are currently registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer, with the reagents for the Advanta Dx SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Assay listed as our sole medical device product. As noted in the issued EUA for the Advanta Dx SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Assay (including the EUA update for use with the AZOVA COVID-19 Test Collection Kit, among other updates) and the issued EUA for the Advanta Dx COVID-19 EASE Assay, the FDA has waived certain quality system requirements under 21 CFR Part 820 for the duration of each EUA. We may in the future list some of our other products with the FDA pursuant to\nan FDA Class I listing for general purpose laboratory equipment if we pursue clinical applications for such equipment. While this regulatory classification is generally exempt from certain FDA requirements, such as the need to submit a premarket notification commonly known as a 510(k), and some of the requirements of the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulations (QSRs), we would be subject to ongoing FDA \u201cgeneral controls,\u201d which include compliance with FDA regulations for labeling, inspections by the FDA, complaint evaluation, corrections and removals reporting, promotional restrictions, reporting adverse events or malfunctions for our products, and general prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. If we do not comply with all the requirements of the EUA or the normal regulatory requirements for any of our medical device products, including additional regulatory requirements that would apply to the Advanta Dx SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Assay and the AZOVA COVID-19 Test Collection Kit after the expiration or termination of the EUA, we may be subject to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, penalties, or fines, among other adverse actions, any of which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Compliance with additional or changing regulatory requirements can be time-consuming and costly.\nIn addition, we may in the future submit 510(k) premarket notifications to the FDA to obtain FDA clearance of certain of our products on a selected basis. It is possible, in the event we elect to submit 510(k) applications for certain of our products, that the FDA would take the position that a more burdensome premarket application, such as a premarket approval application or a de novo application is required for some of our products. If such applications were required, greater time and investment would be required to obtain FDA approval. Even if the FDA agreed that a 510(k) was appropriate, FDA clearance can be expensive and time consuming. It generally takes a significant amount of time to prepare a 510(k), including conducting appropriate testing on our products, and several months to years for the FDA to review a submission. Notwithstanding the effort and expense, FDA clearance or approval could be denied for some or all of our products. Even if we were to seek and obtain regulatory approval or clearance, it may not be for the intended uses we believe are important or commercially attractive.\nIf we sought and received regulatory clearance or approval for certain of our products, we would be subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory oversight and review, including the general controls listed above and the FDA\u2019s QSRs for our development and manufacturing operations. In addition, we would be required to obtain a new 510(k) clearance before we could introduce subsequent material modifications or improvements to such products. We could also be subject to additional FDA post-marketing obligations for such products, any or all of which would increase our costs and divert resources away from other projects. If we sought and received regulatory clearance or approval and are not able to maintain regulatory compliance with applicable laws, we could be prohibited from marketing our products for use as, or in the performance of, clinical diagnostics and/or could be subject to enforcement actions, including warning letters and adverse publicity, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions; and criminal prosecution.\nIn addition, to the extent we decide to seek regulatory marketing authorization for certain of our products in countries outside of the United States, we or our partners, or collaborators, will need to obtain regulatory marketing authorization for our products for the intended use in the jurisdiction where such products will be marketed. Regulatory clearance or approval in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory marketing authorization in other jurisdictions where we conduct business. Sales of such products outside the United States will likely be subject to foreign regulatory requirements, which can vary greatly from country to country. As a result, the time required to obtain clearances or approvals outside the United States may differ from that required to obtain FDA clearance or approval and we may not be able to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all. In Europe, we need to comply with the In Vitro Diagnostic Directive 98/79/EC and transition to the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation 2017/746, which became effective May 26, 2017, with an application date of May 26, 2022. This will increase the difficulty of regulatory approvals in Europe in the future. In addition, the FDA regulates exports of medical devices. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements or obtain and maintain required approvals, clearances and certifications could impair our ability to commercialize our products for diagnostic use outside of the United States.\nIn February 2021, we announced a supply and distribution agreement to market our CyTOF technology, panels, and reagents to clinical labs in China. As part of the agreement, we are working to seek National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) approval for our CyTOF instrument for diagnostic use in China. As we increase our operations outside of the United States, our compliance and operational costs will increase, and we will be exposed to greater liability under additional laws and regulations.\nOur products could become subject to regulation as medical devices by the FDA or other regulatory agencies even if we do not elect to seek regulatory clearance or approval to market our products for diagnostic purposes, which would adversely impact our ability to market and sell our products and harm our business.\nAs products that are currently labeled, promoted and intended as RUO, our products are not currently subject to regulation as medical devices by the FDA or comparable agencies of other countries. However, the FDA or comparable agencies of other countries could disagree with our conclusion that our products are currently intended for research use only or deem our current\nsales, marketing and promotional efforts as being inconsistent with research use only products. For example, our customers may independently elect to use our research use only labeled products in their own laboratory developed tests (LDTs) for clinical diagnostic use. The FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion in not enforcing the medical device regulations against laboratories offering LDTs. However, on October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents that set forth the FDA\u2019s proposed risk-based framework for regulating LDTs, which are designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory. The draft guidance documents provide the anticipated details through which the FDA would propose to establish an LDT oversight framework, including premarket review for higher-risk LDTs, such as those that have the same intended use as FDA-approved or cleared companion diagnostic tests currently on the market. In January 2017, the FDA announced that it would not issue final guidance on the oversight of LDTs and manufacturers of products used for LDTs, but would seek further public discussion on an appropriate oversight approach, and give Congress an opportunity to develop a legislative solution. More recently, the FDA has issued warning letters to certain genomics labs for illegally marketing genetic tests that claim to predict patients\u2019 responses to specific medications, noting that the FDA has not created a legal \u201ccarve-out\u201d for LDTs and retains discretion to take action when appropriate, such as when certain genomic tests raise significant public health concerns. As manufacturers develop more complex genetic tests and diagnostic software, the FDA may increase its regulation of LDTs. Any future legislative or administrative rule making or oversight of LDTs, if and when finalized, may impact the sales of our products and how customers use our products, and may require us to change our business model in order to maintain compliance with these laws. We cannot predict how these various efforts will be resolved, how Congress or the FDA will regulate LDTs in the future, or how that regulatory system will impact our business.\nAdditionally, on November 25, 2013, the FDA issued Final Guidance \u201cDistribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only.\u201d The guidance emphasizes that the FDA will review the totality of the circumstances when it comes to evaluating whether equipment and testing components are properly labeled as RUO. The final guidance states that merely including a labeling statement that the product is for research purposes only will not necessarily render the device exempt from the FDA\u2019s clearance, approval, and other regulatory requirements if the circumstances surrounding the distribution, marketing and promotional practices indicate that the manufacturer knows its products are, or intends for its products to be, used for clinical diagnostic purposes. These circumstances may include written or verbal sales and marketing claims or links to articles regarding a product\u2019s performance in clinical applications and a manufacturer\u2019s provision of technical support for clinical applications.\nIn August 2020, as part of the U.S. government\u2019s efforts to combat COVID-19 and consistent with the direction in Executive Orders 13771 and 13924, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced rescission of guidances and other informal issuances of the FDA regarding premarket review of LDTs absent notice-and-comment rulemaking, stating that, absent notice-and-comment rulemaking, those seeking approval or clearance of, or an emergency use authorization, for an LDT may nonetheless voluntarily submit a premarket approval application, premarket notification or an EUA request, respectively, but are not required to do so. However, laboratories opting to use LDTs without FDA premarket review or authorization would not be eligible for liability protection under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, or the PREP Act. In November 2021, HHS under the Biden administration issued a statement that withdrew the August 2020 policy announcement, stating that HHS does not have a policy on LDTs that is separate from FDA\u2019s longstanding approach. The FDA also issued a revised version of its COVID-19 test policy that states the FDA expects newly offered COVID-19 tests, including LDTs, to have an EUA, or traditional marketing authorization such as a granted De Novo or cleared 510(k), prior to clinical use.\nFurther, in June 2021, Congress introduced an updated legislation called the Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge IVCT Development Act (VALID Act), which, if enacted, will establish a new risk-based regulatory framework for in vitro clinical tests (IVCTs), which include IVDs, LDTs, collection devices, and instruments used with such tests, and a technology certification program, among other proposals. The adoption of new restrictions on IVDs, LDTs, or RUOs, whether by the FDA or Congress, could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and the demand for our specialized reagents and instruments. Further, we could be required to obtain premarket clearance or approval from the FDA before we can sell our products to certain customers.\nIf the FDA determines our products or related applications should be subject to additional regulation as in vitro diagnostic devices based upon customers\u2019 use of our products for clinical diagnostic or therapeutic decision-making purposes, our ability to market and sell our products could be impeded and our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, the FDA could consider our products to be misbranded or adulterated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and subject to recall and/or other enforcement action.\nCompliance or the failure to comply with current and future regulations affecting our products and business operations worldwide, such as environmental regulations enacted in the European Union, could cause us significant expense and adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to many federal, state, local, and foreign regulations relating to various aspects of our business operations. Governmental entities at all levels are continuously enacting new regulations, and it is difficult to identify all applicable regulations and anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with applicable regulations. To comply with applicable regulations, we have and will continue to incur significant expense and allocate valuable internal resources to manage compliance-related issues. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand or equip our facilities, or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with the regulations. For example, the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (RoHS) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE), both enacted in the European Union, regulate the use of certain hazardous substances in, and require the collection, reuse, and recycling of waste from, products we manufacture. Certain of our products sold in these countries are subject to WEEE and RoHS. These and similar regulations that have been or are in the process of being enacted in other countries may require us to redesign our products, use different types of materials in certain components, or source alternative components to ensure compliance with applicable standards, and may reduce the availability of parts and components used in our products by negatively impacting our suppliers\u2019 ability to source parts and components in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nThe Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation (EC) No. 1907/206 is the European Union\u2019s regulation on chemicals and their safe use. The list of chemicals has been updated and some of the updates affect chemicals used in our products. We will request a research exception, but if not granted, we will need to reduce the concentration of some of the chemicals in our products, which will require significant research and development and operations efforts.\nAny such redesigns, required use of alternative materials, or limited availability of parts and components used in our products may detrimentally impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead times for product introductions, reduce our product margins, or limit the markets for our products, and if we fail to comply with any present and future regulations, we could be subject to future fines, penalties, and restrictions, such as the suspension of manufacturing of our products or a prohibition on the sale of products we manufacture. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OPERATING A GLOBAL BUSINESS\nWe generate a substantial portion of our revenue internationally and our international business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial, and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nDuring the years 2021, 2020, and 2019, approximately 56%, 54%, and 63% respectively, of our product and service revenue was generated from sales to customers located outside of the United States. We believe that a significant percentage of our future revenue will continue to come from international sources as we expand our international operations and develop opportunities in other countries. Engaging in international business inherently involves a number of difficulties and risks, including:\n\u2022required compliance with existing and changing foreign regulatory requirements and laws that are or may be applicable to our business in the future, such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and other data privacy requirements, labor and employment regulations, anticompetition regulations, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and other anticorruption laws, and the RoHS and WEEE directives and REACH regulation, which regulate the use and importation of certain hazardous substances in, and require the collection, reuse, and recycling of waste from, products we manufacture;\n\u2022required compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other U.S. federal laws and regulations established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control;\n\u2022export requirements and import or trade restrictions;\n\u2022laws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022changes in social, economic, and political conditions or in laws, regulations and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development, and investment both domestically as well as in the other countries and jurisdictions in which we operate and into which we sell our products, including as a result of the separation of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Brexit) or the Russian invasion of Ukraine;\n\u2022business interruptions and travel restrictions resulting from global sociopolitical events, including war and terrorism, public health crises (including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), and natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, customs charges, bureaucratic requirements, and other trade barriers;\n\u2022difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations; and\n\u2022difficulties protecting or procuring intellectual property rights.\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel restrictions have caused significant slowdowns in China, Japan, and other parts of the Asia-Pacific region. These slowdowns, in addition to shipment delays in China due to delays in obtaining VAT and import tax exemptions for our products, have caused our financial results to suffer. If these situations continue, or if other risks occur, we could be forced to dedicate significant resources to their resolution, and if we are unsuccessful in finding a solution, our financial condition and results will suffer.\nIn addition, political instability, civil unrest, the deterioration of the political situation in a country in which we have significant sales or operations, or the breakdown of trade relations between the United States and a foreign country in which we have significant operations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, a change in trade status between the United States and a foreign country could result in a substantial increase in the import duty of products manufactured in that foreign country and imported into the United States. The United States has commenced certain trade actions, including imposing increased tariffs on certain goods imported into the United States from China, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China. In addition, the United States has commenced certain trade actions as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which are widely expected to result in retaliatory measures or actions, including tariffs, by Russia. Any increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade imposed by the United States, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China, Russia, or other countries in response, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to a variety of new U.S. and foreign export controls and economic sanctions regulations that were issued in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine; our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business.\nDue to recent regulations, U.S. companies can no longer provide or receive services or conduct any business with, including selling, shipping, or otherwise transferring any U.S.-controlled products to, the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People\u2019s Republic (LNR) regions of Ukraine. Additionally, existing U.S. sanctions continue to extend these prohibitions to the Crimea region of Ukraine. Our business is also subject to the expansion of previously existing sanctions imposed by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls that now cover a significant number of individuals and entities located in Russia, Belarus, and surrounding regions as well as new U.S. export controls imposed by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Export Administration Regulations on exports to Russia. These laws and regulations cover U.S. persons as well as U.S.-controlled products, software, and technologies wherever located. Failure to comply with U.S. and foreign export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations can result in criminal sanctions, civil fines, debarment from government contracting, the loss of export privileges, and, in some cases, imprisonment.\nWe are currently implementing new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. The implementation of these measures may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain products or services, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits, regulatory proceedings, and legislative proposals could damage our brand or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Finally, our ability to receive payment from these regions has been significantly impacted. Any costs incurred or loss of business that occurs as a result of compliance or other liabilities under these laws or regulations could harm our business and operating results.\nAdverse conditions in the global economy and disruption of financial markets may significantly harm our revenue, profitability, and results of operations.\nAdverse economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets, including the worldwide economic disruption related to the COVID-19 pandemic and related slowdowns in China, Japan, and elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, have negatively affected our revenues and operating results and may continue to do so. Even before the current public health crisis took hold,\nthe global credit and financial markets had been experiencing volatility and disruptions, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, increased concerns about inflation and deflation, and the downgrade of U.S. debt and exposure risks on other sovereign debts, decreased consumer confidence, lower economic growth, volatile energy costs, increased unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability. Geopolitical events including the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including any resulting adoption and expansion of trade restrictions by the United States, Russia, and/or China, and Brexit have caused significant economic, market, political and regulatory uncertainty in some of our markets. Volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit our customers\u2019 ability to obtain adequate financing or credit to purchase and pay for our products in a timely manner or to maintain operations, which could result in a decrease in sales volume that could harm our results of operations. General concerns about the fundamental soundness of domestic and international economies may also cause our customers to reduce their purchases. Changes in governmental banking, monetary, and fiscal policies to address liquidity and increase credit availability may not be effective. Significant government investment and allocation of resources to assist the economic recovery of sectors that do not include our customers may reduce the resources available for government grants and related funding for life science, plant and animal research, and clinical research and development. Continuation or further deterioration of these financial and macroeconomic conditions could significantly harm our sales, profitability, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies.\nA majority of our product sales are currently denominated in U.S. dollars and fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could decrease demand for our products and adversely impact our financial performance. For example, if the value of the U.S. dollar increases relative to foreign currencies, our products could become more costly to the international consumer and therefore less competitive in international markets, or if the value of the U.S. dollar decreases relative to the Singapore dollar or the Canadian dollar, it would become more costly in U.S. dollars for us to manufacture our products in Singapore and/or in Canada. Additionally, our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, which is primarily in the United States, with a portion of expenses incurred in Singapore and Canada where a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are located. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income or loss as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future.\nFINANCIAL, TAX, AND ACCOUNTING RISKS\nAs disclosed in footnote two of our consolidated financial statements, and referenced in our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report, we believe that our current level of cash and cash equivalents, together with committed financing facilities, are not sufficient to fund ongoing operations for at least the twelve-month period after the financial statements were issued. The existence of these conditions raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d for at least the twelve-month period following the date the financial statements were issued.\nOur current cash position and recurring operating losses have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least the twelve-month period following the date the financial statements were issued. As of December 31, 2021, we had $29.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. Due to an extended strategic review process related to the pending Private Placement Issuance, we were unable in 2021 to implement certain cash management actions, including potential financing and/or cost reduction initiatives. Further, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, negative cash flows in pursuit of our business plans for at least the twelve-month period following the date the financial statements were issued. Management\u2019s plans to address the doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern are discussed under Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.\u201d Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our success in obtaining additional equity or debt financing, attaining further operating efficiencies, reducing expenditures and ultimately, generating significant revenue growth. Our plans to raise additional capital, including our ability to consummate the Private Placement Issuance, or take other actions to address the doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern, may not be successful. There can be no assurance that the Company would be able to obtain additional liquidity when needed or under acceptable terms, if at all. The perception of our ability to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and could result in the loss of confidence by investors, suppliers and employees.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future, which may cause dilution to stockholders or may be upon terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe have continued to experience losses and, if that trend continues, we may need to seek additional sources of financing. If our plans to raise capital and to consummate the Private Placement Issuance are not successful, or if such funds are insufficient to meet our cash requirements, we may need to raise substantial capital for various purposes, including:\n\u2022funding our operations;\n\u2022expanding the commercialization of our products;\n\u2022furthering our research and development; and\n\u2022acquiring other businesses or assets and licensing technologies.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022the cost of our research and development activities;\n\u2022the cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications;\n\u2022the cost of defending any litigation including intellectual property, employment, contractual or other litigation;\n\u2022the cost and timing of regulatory clearances or approvals, if any;\n\u2022the cost and timing of establishing additional sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022the cost and timing of establishing additional technical support capabilities;\n\u2022fluctuations in cash demands (e.g., due to interest or principal payments or payouts under existing cash compensation plans);\n\u2022variability in sales and timing of related cash collections;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our efficiency and cost-savings initiatives;\n\u2022the impact of any natural disasters or public health crises (including the COVID-19 pandemic);\n\u2022the effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n\u2022the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products, and technologies, although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions.\nTo the extent we draw on our revolving credit facility or otherwise incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. Further, if we increase our indebtedness, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms, or at all. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, increasing the cost of-and adversely impacting access to-capital. We entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement (Sale Agreement) with Jefferies LLC (Jefferies) to sell shares of our common stock having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $50 million, from time to time, through an at-the-market (ATM) equity offering program under which Jefferies acts as sales agent. During the third quarter of 2020, we sold approximately 2.5 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the Sale Agreement, for aggregate gross proceeds of $20.9 million. Our net proceeds were approximately $20.1 million, after deducting related expenses, including commissions of approximately $0.6 million and issuance costs of approximately $0.2 million. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, either under the ATM program or otherwise, our stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing in addition to our credit facility, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any additional debt or equity financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders, and our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we do not have or are unable to raise adequate funds, we may have to liquidate some or all of our assets, delay development or commercialization of our products, or license to third parties the rights to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize. We also may have to reduce marketing, customer support, research and development, or other resources devoted to our products, or cease operations. Any of these factors could harm our operating results.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be impaired, which could adversely affect our business and our stock price.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses.\nOur compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues. We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we continue to evaluate our need for additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. Moreover, if we do not comply with the requirements of Section 404, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nWe may not realize the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets, which would be reflected in an impairment charge.\nOur business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense. We make estimates and assumptions in valuing such intangible assets that affect our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $135.6 million of goodwill and net intangible assets, including approximately $106.4 million of goodwill and $29.2 million of net intangible assets. These assets represent a significant portion of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and relate primarily to our acquisition of DVS Sciences, Inc. (DVS) in February 2014 and InstruNor in 2020. In addition, if in the future we acquire additional businesses, technologies, or other intangible assets, a substantial portion of the value of such assets may be recorded as goodwill or intangible assets.\nWe assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. We assess the realizability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset. Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses. If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.\nIf we fail to comply with the covenants and other obligations under our debt facilities, the lenders may be able to accelerate amounts owed under the facilities and, in the case of our Credit Facility (as defined below), may foreclose upon the assets securing our obligations.\nIn August 2021, we amended our Loan and Security Agreement dated as of August 2, 2018, between the Company and Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) (the Credit Agreement), which provides for secured revolving loans in an aggregate amount of up to $15.0 million (the Revolving Credit Facility), to extend the maturity date to August 2, 2023 and to provide for a new $10.0 million term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, other than intellectual property. The Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants which, unless waived by the bank, limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, repurchase stock, pay dividends, transfer assets, enter into affiliate transactions, undergo a change of control, or engage in merger and acquisition activity, including merging or consolidating with a third party. Additionally, we are required to maintain a minimum Adjusted Quick Ratio (as defined in the amendment) of at least 1.25 to 1.00. If we fail to comply with the covenants and our other obligations under the Credit Facility, the lenders would be able to accelerate the required repayment of amounts due under the Credit Facility and, if they are not repaid, could foreclose upon the assets securing our obligations under the Credit Facility.\nIn January 2022, we entered into the Bridge Loan Agreements. Each Bridge Loan Agreement provides for a $12.5 million term loan to the Company. Each Bridge Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants which, unless waived by the applicable lenders, limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, repurchase stock, pay dividends, transfer assets, enter into affiliate transactions, undergo a change of control, or engage in merger and acquisition activity, including merging or consolidating with a third party. If we fail to comply with the covenants and our other obligations under the Bridge Loan Agreements, the lenders would, subject to a subordination agreement, be able to accelerate the required repayment of amounts due under the Bridge Loan Agreements.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes and other tax benefits may be limited.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income that may be offset by net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) if a corporation experiences an \u201cownership change.\u201d As provided in Section 382 of the Code, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs when a company\u2019s \u201cfive-percent shareholders\u201d collectively increase their ownership in the company by more than 50 percentage points (by value) over a rolling three-year period. Various states also have limitations on the use of state NOLs following an ownership change.\nWe may experience an ownership change in connection with the Private Placement Issuance. Additionally, any other future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. If we experience an ownership change, our ability to use our NOLs or other tax benefits could be substantially limited, which could significantly impair their value. There is no assurance that we will be able to fully utilize our NOLs or other tax benefits, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe believe that these tax benefits are a valuable asset for us and we monitor our stock ownership to determine whether our NOLs are at material risk of limitation based on an ownership change pursuant to Section 382. If our board of directors determines a potential risk exists that our NOLs could be limited, it could elect to adopt a tax benefit preservation plan in an effort to protect our tax benefits. Adoption of a tax benefit preservation plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, us or a large block of our common stock.\nWe are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions and our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected and we could have additional tax liability if existing tax laws or regulations change or if taxing authorities disagree with our interpretations of tax laws or regulations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations are required in determining the provision for income taxes. For example, we have made certain interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations based upon the operations of our business internationally and we have implemented intercompany agreements based upon these interpretations and related transfer pricing analyses. If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities disagree with the positions, our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected and we could have additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. From time to time, we may review our corporate structure and tax positions in the various international jurisdictions in which we operate and such review may result in changes to how we structure our international business operations, which may adversely impact our effective income tax rate. Our effective income tax rate could also be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in existing tax laws or tax rates, changes in the level of non-deductible expenses (including share-based compensation), changes in our future levels of research and development spending, mergers and acquisitions, or the result of examinations by various tax authorities. Payment of additional amounts as a result of changes in applicable tax law or upon final adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nChanges in accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions. Additionally, the adoption of new or revised accounting principles may require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls.\nIt is not clear if or when potential changes in accounting principles may become effective, whether we have the proper systems and controls in place to accommodate such changes and the impact that any such changes may have on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe have a significant amount of outstanding indebtedness, and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not efficiently manage our liabilities.\nWe have significant outstanding convertible debt. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding $0.6 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.75% Senior Convertible Notes due 2034 (2014 Notes) and $55.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.25% convertible senior notes due 2024 (2019 Notes, and collectively with the 2014 Notes, the Convertible Notes). The 2014 Notes will mature on February 1, 2034, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased in accordance with the terms of the 2014 Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the 2014 Notes (2014 Notes Indenture), holders of the 2014\nNotes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2014 Notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of such 2014 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on each of February 6, 2024 and February 6, 2029. The 2019 Notes will mature on December 1, 2024, unless earlier converted, or repurchased in accordance with the terms of the 2019 Notes.\nIf we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the 2014 Notes Indenture or the indenture governing the 2019 Notes, as applicable), holders of the applicable series of Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase such Convertible Notes in whole or in part for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the applicable series of Convertible Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. If we refinance all or any portion of the Convertible Notes, we may issue additional convertible notes or other debt, which could include additional company obligations and represent more dilution to existing stockholders and noteholders.\nThis significant amount of debt has important risks to us and our investors, including:\n\u2022requiring a portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.\nIn January 2022, we borrowed $25.0 million under the Bridge Loan Agreements in connection with the Private Placement Issuance. In addition, to the extent we draw on our Revolving Credit Facility or otherwise incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. Further, if we increase our indebtedness, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance our debt.\nRISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. We rely on patent protection, where appropriate and available, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws, and nondisclosure, confidentiality, and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. We apply for patents covering our products and technologies and uses thereof, as we deem appropriate. However, we may fail to apply for patents on important products and technologies in a timely fashion or at all. Our pending U.S. and foreign patent applications may not issue as patents or may not issue in a form that will be sufficient to protect our proprietary technology and gain or keep our competitive advantage. Any patents we have obtained or do obtain may be subject to re-examination, reissue, opposition, or other administrative proceeding, or may be challenged in litigation, and such challenges could result in a determination that the patent is invalid or unenforceable. In addition, competitors may be able to design alternative methods or devices that avoid infringement of our patents. Both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive.\nFurthermore, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. We cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. For example:\n\u2022we might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications;\n\u2022we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business; and\n\u2022others may independently develop similar or alternative products and technologies or duplicate any of our products and technologies.\nTo the extent our intellectual property, including licensed intellectual property, offers inadequate protection, or is found to be invalid or unenforceable, our competitive position and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and proprietary rights, to determine the scope, coverage and validity of others\u2019 proprietary rights, or to defend against third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, any of which could be time-intensive and costly and may adversely impact our business or stock price.\nLitigation may be necessary for us to enforce our patent and proprietary rights, determine the scope, coverage, and validity of others\u2019 proprietary rights, and/or defend against third-party claims of intellectual property infringement against us as well as against our suppliers, distributors, customers, and other entities with which we do business. Litigation could result in substantial legal fees and could adversely affect the scope of our patent protection. The outcome of any litigation or other proceeding is inherently uncertain and might not be favorable to us, and we might not be able to obtain licenses to technology that we require. Even if such licenses are obtainable, they may not be available at a reasonable cost. We could therefore incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties, which could negatively affect our product margins or financial position. Further, we could encounter delays in product introductions, or interruptions in product sales, as we develop alternative methods or products.\nAs we move into new markets and applications for our products, incumbent participants in such markets may assert their patents and other proprietary rights against us as a means of impeding our entry into such markets or as a means to extract substantial license and royalty payments from us. Our commercial success may depend in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous significant intellectual property issues have been litigated, and will likely continue to be litigated, between existing and new participants in our existing and targeted markets. For example, some of our products provide for the testing and analysis of genetic material, and patent rights relating to genetic materials remain a developing area of patent law. A 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision held, among other things, that claims to isolated genomic DNA occurring in nature are not patent eligible, while claims relating to synthetic DNA may be patent eligible. In addition, third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization, and if they are successful in making such claims, we may be forced to enter into license agreements, pay additional royalties or license fees, or enter into settlements that include monetary obligations or restrictions on our business.\nOur customers have been sued for various claims of intellectual property infringement in the past, and we expect that our customers will be involved in additional litigation in the future. In particular, our customers may become subject to lawsuits claiming that their use of our products infringes third-party patent rights, and we could become subject to claims that we contributed to or induced our customer\u2019s infringement. In addition, our agreements with some of our suppliers, distributors, customers, and other entities with which we do business may require us to defend or indemnify these parties to the extent they become involved in infringement claims against us, including the claims described above. We could also voluntarily agree to defend or indemnify third parties in instances where we are not obligated to do so if we determine it would be important to our business relationships. If we are required or agree to defend or indemnify any of these third parties in connection with any infringement claims, we could incur significant costs and expenses that could adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our employees\u2019 former employers or other institutions or third parties with which such employees may have been previously affiliated.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other life science or plant and animal research companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. In the future, we may become subject to claims that our employees, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or other third parties or institutions with which our employees may have been previously affiliated. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. A resulting loss of key research personnel work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize certain potential products or a loss of or inability to hire key marketing, sales or research and development personnel could adversely affect our future product development, sales and revenues, any of which could severely harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against any such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nWe depend on certain technologies that are licensed to us. We do not control these technologies and any loss of our rights to them could prevent us from selling our products, which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on licenses in order to be able to use various proprietary technologies that are material to our business, including our core IFC, multi-layer soft lithography, and mass cytometry technologies. In some cases, we do not control the prosecution, maintenance, or filing of the patents to which we hold licenses, or the enforcement of these patents against third parties.\nAdditionally, our business and product development plans anticipate and may substantially depend on future in-license agreements with additional third parties, some of which are currently in the early discussion phase. For example, Fluidigm Canada Inc. (Fluidigm Canada), an Ontario corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Fluidigm Sciences, was party to an interim license agreement, now expired, with Nodality, Inc. (Nodality) under which Nodality granted Fluidigm Canada a worldwide, non-exclusive, research use only, royalty bearing license to certain cytometric reagents, instruments, and other products. While we were able to secure a license under a new license agreement with Nodality, we cannot provide assurances that we will always be able to obtain suitable license rights to technologies or intellectual property of other third parties on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIn-licensed intellectual property rights that are fundamental to our business being operated present numerous risks and limitations. For example, all or a portion of the license rights granted may be limited for research use only, and in the event we attempt to expand into diagnostic applications, we would be required to negotiate additional rights, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nOur rights to use the technology we license are also subject to the negotiation and continuation of those licenses. Certain of our licenses contain provisions that allow the licensor to terminate the license upon specific conditions. Our rights under the licenses are subject to our continued compliance with the terms of the license, including the payment of royalties due under the license. Because of the complexity of our products and the patents we have licensed, determining the scope of the license and related royalty obligation can be difficult and can lead to disputes between us and the licensor. An unfavorable resolution of such a dispute could lead to an increase in the royalties payable pursuant to the license. If a licensor believed we were not paying the royalties due under the license or were otherwise not in compliance with the terms of the license, the licensor might attempt to revoke the license. If such an attempt were successful and the license is terminated, we might be barred from marketing, producing, and selling some or all of our products, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Potential disputes between us and one of our existing licensors concerning the terms or conditions of the applicable license agreement could result, among other risks, in substantial management distraction; increased expenses associated with litigation or efforts to resolve disputes; substantial customer uncertainty concerning the direction of our product lines; potential infringement claims against us and/or our customers, which could include efforts by a licensor to enjoin sales of our products; customer requests for indemnification by us; and, in the event of an adverse determination, our inability to operate our business as currently operated. Termination of material license agreements could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products unless we can negotiate new license terms or develop or acquire alternative intellectual property rights that cover or enable similar functionality. Any of these factors would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and could result in a substantial decline in our stock price.\nWe are subject to certain manufacturing restrictions related to licensed technologies that were developed with the financial assistance of U.S. governmental grants.\nWe are subject to certain U.S. government regulations because we have licensed technologies that were developed with U.S. government grants. In accordance with these regulations, these licenses provide that products embodying the technologies are subject to domestic manufacturing requirements. If this domestic manufacturing requirement is not met, the government agency that funded the relevant grant is entitled to exercise specified rights, referred to as \u201cmarch-in rights,\u201d which if exercised would allow the government agency to require the licensors or us to grant a non-exclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a third party designated by such agency. All of our microfluidic systems revenue is dependent upon the availability of our IFCs, which incorporate technology developed with U.S. government grants. Our genomics instruments, including microfluidic systems and IFCs, are manufactured at our facility in Singapore. The federal regulations allow the funding government agency to grant, at the request of the licensors of such technology, a waiver of the domestic manufacturing requirement. Waivers may be requested prior to any government notification. We have assisted the licensors of these technologies with the analysis of the domestic manufacturing requirement, and, in December 2008, the sole licensor subject to the requirement applied for a waiver of the domestic manufacturing requirement with respect to the relevant patents licensed to us by this licensor. In July 2009, the funding government agency granted the requested waiver of the domestic manufacturing requirement for a three-year period commencing in July 2009. In June 2012, the licensor requested a continued waiver of the domestic manufacturing requirement with respect to the relevant patents, but the government agency has not yet taken any action in response to this request. If the government agency does not grant the requested waiver or the government fails to grant additional waivers of such requirement that may be sought in the future, then the U.S. government could exercise its march-in rights with respect to the relevant patents licensed to us. In addition, the license agreement under which the relevant patents are licensed to us contains provisions that obligate us to comply with this domestic manufacturing requirement. We are not currently manufacturing instruments and IFCs in the United States that incorporate the relevant licensed technology. If our lack of compliance with this provision constituted a material breach of the license agreement, the license of the relevant patents could be terminated or we could be compelled to relocate our manufacturing of microfluidic systems and IFCs to the United States to avoid or cure a material breach of the license agreement. Any of the exercise of march-in rights, the\ntermination of our license of the relevant patents or the relocation of our manufacturing of microfluidic systems and IFCs to the United States could materially adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to certain obligations and restrictions relating to technologies developed in cooperation with Canadian government agencies.\nSome of our Canadian research and development is funded in part through government grants and by government agencies. The intellectual property developed through these projects is subject to rights and restrictions in favor of government agencies and Canadians generally. In most cases the government agency retains the right to use intellectual property developed through the project for non-commercial purposes and to publish the results of research conducted in connection with the project. This may increase the risk of public disclosure of information relating to our intellectual property, including confidential information, and may reduce its competitive advantage in commercializing intellectual property developed through these projects. In certain projects, we have also agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize intellectual property in Canada, or more specifically in the province of Ontario, for the economic benefit of Canada and the province of Ontario. These restrictions will limit our choice of business and manufacturing locations, business partners and corporate structure and may, in certain circumstances, restrict our ability to achieve maximum profitability and cost efficiency from the intellectual property generated by these projects. In one instance, a dispute with the applicable government funded entity may require mediation, which could lead to unanticipated delays in our commercialization efforts to that project. One of our Canadian government funded projects is also subject to certain limited \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights in favor of the government of the Province of Ontario, under which we may be required to grant a license to our intellectual property, including background intellectual property developed outside the scope of the project, to a responsible applicant on reasonable terms in circumstances where the government determines that such a license is necessary in order to alleviate emergency or extraordinary health or safety needs or for public use. In addition, we must provide reasonable assistance to the government in obtaining similar licenses from third parties required in connection with the use of its intellectual property. Instances in which the government of the Province of Ontario has exercised similar \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights are rare; however, the exercise of such rights could materially adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur stock price is volatile.\nOur stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (Nasdaq), but we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain an active trading market on Nasdaq or any other exchange in the future. The trading volume of our stock tends to be low relative to our total outstanding shares, and we have several stockholders who hold substantial blocks of our stock. As of December 31, 2021, we had 76,919,287 shares of common stock outstanding, and stockholders holding at least 5% of our stock, individually or with affiliated persons or entities, collectively beneficially owned or controlled approximately 51% of such shares. Sales of large numbers of shares by any of our large stockholders, including in connection with the Private Placement Issuance, could adversely affect our trading price, particularly given our relatively small historic trading volumes. If stockholders holding shares of our common stock sell, indicate an intention to sell, or if it is perceived that they will sell, substantial amounts of their common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Moreover, if there is no active trading market or if the volume of trading is limited, holders of our common stock may have difficulty selling their shares. In addition, the concentration of ownership of our outstanding common stock (approximately 51% held by our top seven stockholders as of December 31, 2021) means that a relatively small number of stockholders have significant control over the outcomes of stockholder voting.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022the impact of public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, on global financial markets;\n\u2022actual or anticipated quarterly variation in our results of operations or the results of our competitors;\n\u2022our failure to achieve performance consistent with our financial guidance and/or market expectations;\n\u2022announcements or communications by us or our competitors relating to, among other things, new commercial products, technological advances, significant contracts, commercial relationships, capital commitments, acquisitions or sales of businesses, and/or misperceptions in or speculation by the market regarding such announcements or communications;\n\u2022issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations for our stock;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022commencement of, or our involvement in, litigation;\n\u2022market conditions in the life science, plant and animal research, and contract research organization sectors;\n\u2022failure to complete significant sales;\n\u2022manufacturing disruptions that could occur if we are unable to successfully expand our production in our current or an alternative facility;\n\u2022supply chain disruptions;\n\u2022any future sales of our common stock or other securities in connection with raising additional capital or otherwise, including the Private Placement Issuance;\n\u2022any major change to the composition of our board of directors or management;\n\u2022general market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including deteriorating market conditions due to investor concerns regarding inflation and hostilities between Russia and Ukraine; and\n\u2022general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.\nThe stock market in general, and market prices for the securities of technology-based companies like ours in particular, have from time to time experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of the underlying companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance.\nIn several recent situations where the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. As discussed in Part I Item 3 (Legal Proceedings) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a class action securities lawsuit against us is currently pending. While we are continuing to defend such action vigorously, the defense of this action and any additional actions can be costly, divert the time and attention of our management, and harm our operating results, and any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nOur stock price could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nIn addition, in the future, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangements or otherwise. Any such future issuance, including any issuances pursuant to our ATM equity offering program under our Sale Agreement with Jefferies, could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe will have broad discretion over the use of the proceeds to us from our ATM equity offering program and may apply the proceeds to uses that do not improve our operating results or the value of your securities.\nWe will have broad discretion to use the net proceeds to us from our ATM equity offering program, and investors will be relying solely on the judgment of our board of directors and management regarding the application of these proceeds. Investors will not have the opportunity, as part of their investment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. Our use of the proceeds may not improve our operating results or increase the value of the securities offered pursuant to the ATM equity offering program.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish unfavorable research about us or cease to cover our business, our stock price and/or trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may rely, in part, on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control of the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management, including provisions that:\n\u2022authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u2022require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer or the president;\n\u2022establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II, and Class III, with each class serving staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022provide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u2022specify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors; and\n\u2022require a super-majority of votes to amend certain of the above-mentioned provisions.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us.\nThe forum selection provision in our bylaws could limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum viewed by the stockholders as more favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another State court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware) is the exclusive forum for the following (except for any claim as to which such court determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of such court (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of such court within 10 days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than such court or for which such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction):\n\u2022any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us arising under the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; and\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\nThis provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nOur bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\nThese exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provisions, and the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 charter documents has been challenged in legal proceedings.\nIt is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable, and if a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.\nAny conversions of the 2014 Notes, the 2019 Notes, or the Bridge Loans will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders and may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nAny conversion of some or all of the 2014 Notes, 2019 Notes, or Bridge Loans will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could also adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, holders of the 2014 Notes, 2019 Notes, or Bridge Loans may hedge their position in such convertible notes by entering into short positions with respect to the underlying common stock. As a result, any anticipated conversion of the 2014 Notes, 2019 Notes, or Bridge Loans could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.", "PERMNO": 12577, "SIC": 3826, "TIC": "FLDM"}
