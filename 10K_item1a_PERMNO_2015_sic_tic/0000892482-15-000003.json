{"cik": "892482", "company": "Qumu Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our results of operations, cash flows and the market price of our common stock could be negatively impacted. Although we believe that we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our performance or financial condition. Any forecast regarding our future performance, including, but not limited to, forecasts regarding estimated bookings, revenue, or cash flow from our operating activities, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect various assumptions and are subject to significant uncertainties and risks that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statement, including the risks reflected in the risk factors set forth below. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and the variation of actual results or events from such statements may be material and adverse.\nThe markets for video content and software to manage video content are each in early stages of development. If this market does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect, our revenues may decline or fail to grow.\nWith the sale of the disc publishing business on July 1, 2014, we now derive all of our revenues from providing video content management software. The use of video as a mainstream communication and collaboration tool and the market for video content management software is in an early stage of development, and it is uncertain whether this use of video will achieve high levels of acceptance. Widespread acceptance and use of video in the enterprise is critical to our future growth and success. Likewise, it is uncertain whether video content management software will achieve high levels of demand and market acceptance. Our success will depend on enterprises adopting video as a tool and upon enterprise demand for software to help them capture, organize and distribute this content.\nSome customers may be reluctant or unwilling to use video as a tool within the enterprise for a number of reasons, including lack of perceived benefit of this new method of communication and existing investments in other enterprise-wide communications tools. Further, even if customers are using video as a tool, these customers may choose to rely upon their own IT infrastructure and resources to manage their video content. Because many companies generally are predisposed to maintaining control of their IT systems and infrastructure, there may be resistance to using software as a service provided by a third party. Privacy concerns and transition costs are also factors that may affect a potential customer\u2019s decision to subscribe to an external solution.\nAdditional factors that may limit market acceptance of our video content management software include:\n\u2022\ncompetitive dynamics may cause pricing levels to change as the market matures and cause customers to seek out lower priced alternatives to our video content management software or force us to reduce the prices we charge for our products or services; or\n\u2022\nexisting and new market participants may introduce new types of solutions and different approaches to enable enterprises to address their enterprise communications or video communications needs and these disruptive technologies may reduce demand for our video content management software.\nIf customers do not perceive the benefits of our video content management software, or if customers are unwilling to accept video content an alternative to other more traditional forms of enterprise communication, the market for our software might not continue to develop or might develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our revenues and growth prospects.\nTo compete effectively, we must continually improve existing products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance.\nThe software industry in general, and in particular, software targeted to a new and developing market like enterprise video content management, is characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements. The introduction of products using new technologies or the adoption of new industry standards can make our existing products, or products under development, obsolete or unmarketable. If\nthese technologies are patented or proprietary to our competitors, we may not be able to access these technologies. In order to remain competitive and increase sales, we must anticipate and adapt to these rapidly changing technologies, enhance our existing products and introduce new products to address the changing demands of our customers. If we fail to anticipate or respond to technological developments or customer requirements, or if we are significantly delayed in developing and introducing products, our revenues will decline.\nThe process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers\u2019 changing needs and emerging technological trends, our business could be harmed. We must commit significant resources and may incur obligations (such as royalty obligations) to develop new products and features before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept and without knowing the levels of revenue, if any, that may be derived from these products. Although we expect to continue to invest substantial resources in product development activities, our efforts to achieve and maintain profitability will require us to be selective and focused with our research and development expenditures. Some of our competitors have greater engineering and product development resources than we have, allowing them to develop a greater number of products or improvements or to develop them more quickly.\nIf we fail to anticipate or respond in a cost-effective and timely manner to technological developments, changes in industry standards or customer requirements, or if we experience any significant delays in the development or introduction of new products or improvements to existing products, our business, operating results and financial condition could be affected adversely.\nWe face intense competition in all areas of our business and such competition may result in price reductions, lower gross profits and loss of market share.\nOur products face intense competition, both from other products and from other technologies, both in the U.S. and in international markets. We compete with others such as Kaltura, Kontiki, Cisco, Polycom, vBrick, Brightcove and MediaPlatform who deliver video content to businesses. We expect the intensity of competition we face to increase in the future from other established and emerging companies.\nMany of our competitors have greater resources than we do, including greater sales, product development, marketing, financial, technical or engineering resources. In addition, because our enterprise video content management software business is relatively new with a limited operating history, our target customers may prefer to purchase software products that are critical to their business from one of our larger, more established competitors.\nTo remain competitive, we believe that we must continue to provide:\n\u2022\ntechnologically advanced products and solutions that anticipate and satisfy the demands of end-users;\n\u2022\ncontinuing advancements or innovations in our product offerings, including products with price-performance advantages or value-added features in security, reliability or other key areas of customer interest;\n\u2022\ninnovations in video content creation, management, delivery and user experience;\n\u2022\na responsive and effective sales force;\n\u2022\na dependable and efficient sales distribution network;\n\u2022\nsuperior customer service; and\n\u2022\nhigh levels of quality and reliability.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors. Competition may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins, increased discounts to customers and loss of market share, and could require increased spending by us on research and development, sales and marketing and customer support.\nAdverse economic conditions, particularly those affecting our customers have harmed and may continue to harm our business.\nUnfavorable changes in economic conditions, including recession, inflation, lack of access to capital, lack of consumer confidence or other changes have resulted and may continue to result in lower spending among our customers and target customers.\nFurther, we sell our products throughout the United States, as well as in several international countries to commercial and government customers. Our business may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other countries such as disruptions in financial markets, reductions in government spending, or downturns in economic activity in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which we operate; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, or regulations. These factors are beyond our control, but may result in further decreases in spending among customers and softening demand for our products.\nFurther, challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, our cash flow may be negatively impacted and our allowance for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.\nCompetition for highly skilled personnel is intense and if we fail to attract and retain talented employees, we may fail to compete effectively.\nOur future success depends, in significant part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees, particularly in senior management, product development and sales, is intense. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees given the high demand for these employees from other employers. Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nOur sales will decline, and our business will be materially harmed, if our sales and marketing efforts are not effective.\nWe will need to continue to expand and optimize our sales infrastructure in order to grow our customer base and our business. We plan to continue to expand our internal sales force, both domestically and internationally. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use and functionality of our software requires significant time, expense and attention. It can take six months or longer before our sales representatives are fully-trained and productive. If we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel or if new sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of this investment or increase our revenues. We also intend to expand new sales models that focus on different sales strategies tailored to different customer types. Our business may be adversely affected if our efforts to expand and train our internal sales force or execute our selling strategies do not generate a corresponding increase in revenues.\nFor sales that are made to customers through our channel partners, we depend on these businesses to provide effective sales and marketing support to our products. Our channel partners are independent businesses that we do not control. Our agreements with channel partners do not contain requirements that a certain percentage of such parties\u2019 sales are of our products. These channel partners may choose to devote their efforts to other products in different markets or reduce or fail to devote the resources to provide effective sales and marketing support of our products, any of which could harm our business by reducing sales to customers.\nWe believe that our future growth and success will depend upon the success of our internal sales and marketing efforts as well as those of our channel partners.\nWe encounter long sales cycles with our Qumu Enterprise software products, which could adversely affect our operating results in a given period.\nOur ability to increase revenues and achieve profitability depends, in large part, on widespread acceptance of our enterprise video content management software products by large businesses and other organizations. As we target our sales efforts at these customers, we face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing sales. In the large enterprise market, the customer\u2019s decision to use our products may be an enterprise-wide decision and, therefore, these types of sales require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our applications. Further, given the constant innovation with our industry and our products, customers may delay purchasing decisions until certain features or products in development are brought to market. Longer sales cycles could cause our operating and financial results to suffer in a given period.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. These material weaknesses, if not corrected, could affect the reliability of our financial statements and have other adverse consequences.\nIn connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, we have concluded that there is a material weakness relating to our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe did not perform an adequate risk assessment relative to our internal control over financial reporting for our continuing business as a result of the divestiture of our disc publishing business. Specifically, our risk assessment process did not (i) allow for the design of our account reconciliations and journal entry controls over significant estimates and accounting transactions to be at an appropriate level of precision to identify material errors, including the validation of the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the performance of those controls, and (ii) evaluate the impact of information technology control deficiencies that affect the design and operating effectiveness of controls related to the completeness and accuracy of underlying data included in\nsystem generated reports. As a result, a reasonable possibility exists that material misstatements in the Company\u2019s financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. For additional information on these matters, see Part II, Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result of this material weakness, management has determined that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2014.\nIn light of the material weakness identified, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure that our consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods disclosed in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Subsequent to our December 31, 2014 fiscal year end, we also have begun to develop a plan to remediate the material weaknesses described above. We expect to continue our remediation efforts, including testing of operating effectiveness of new controls during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015. We expect to incur additional costs remediating this material weakness.\nAlthough we believe we are taking appropriate actions to remediate the control deficiencies we identified and to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting, we may need to take additional measures to fully mitigate the material weakness, and the measures we have taken, and expect to take, to improve our internal controls may not be sufficient to address the issues identified, to ensure that our internal controls are effective or to ensure that the identified material weakness will not result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements. In addition, other material weaknesses or deficiencies may be identified in the future. If we are unable to correct material weaknesses or deficiencies in internal controls in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC will be adversely affected. This failure could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and generally materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nWe have limited operating history with our video content software management business, which may make evaluating our business and prospects difficult.\nWith our acquisition of Qumu, Inc. in October 2011, we began our video content management business. Prior to the acquisition of Qumu, Inc. and through July 1, 2014, we also operated the disc publishing business. As a result, we have a limited history with our video content software management business and an even more limited history with the standalone operation of the video content software management business. Accordingly, our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of the future financial condition or results of operations of our video content management business. This limited history may make it difficult for shareholders, prospective investors, analysts and others to evaluate our business and prospects given the risks and uncertainties that we face as a relatively early stage, high technology company entering a new and rapidly evolving market.\nOur software business has incurred operating losses in the past and we expect to incur additional operating losses into 2016.\nOur software business has incurred operating losses since our acquisition of it in October 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred an operating loss of $28.7 million and a net loss from continuing operations of $22.3 million. We cannot assure you when, if ever, we will achieve sustained profitability and cash flow break even operations. Failure to become and remain profitable and cash flow positive may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Losses and lack of significant cash flow from operations also may deplete our cash position and adversely affect our ability to obtain capital or grow our business.\nOur enterprise video content management software products must be successfully integrated into our customers\u2019 information technology environments and workflows and changes to these environments, workflows or unforeseen combinations of technologies may harm our customers\u2019 experience in using our software products.\nA significant portion of our sales are made into applications that require our enterprise video content management software products to be integrated into other enterprise workflows, enterprise information technology environments or software functionalities. Any significant changes to enterprise workflows, IT environments or software programs may limit the use or functionality of or demand for our products. As our customers advance technologically, we must be able to effectively integrate our products to remain competitive. Further, current and potential customers may choose to use products offered by our competitors or may not purchase our products if our products would require changes in their existing enterprise workflows, IT environments or software.\nThe growth and functionality of our enterprise video content management software products depend upon the solution\u2019s effective operation with mobile operating systems and computer networks.\nOur products are currently compatible with various mobile operating systems including the iOS, Windows Mobile and Android operating systems. The functionality of our products depends upon the continued interoperability of these products with popular mobile operating systems. Any changes in these systems that degrade our products\u2019 functionality or give preferential treatment to competitive offerings could adversely affect the operability and usage of our video management software products on mobile\ndevices. Additionally, in order to deliver a high quality user experience, it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, systems, and networks. We may not be successful in keeping pace with changes in mobile technologies, operating systems, or networks or in developing products that operate effectively within existing or future technologies, systems, and networks. Further, any significant changes to mobile operating systems by their respective developers may prevent our products from working properly or at all on these systems. In the event that it is more difficult for users to access content delivered by our solutions to their mobile devices, if our products do not operate effectively within the most popular operating systems or if popular mobile devices do not offer a high quality user experience, sales of and customer demand for our software products could be harmed.\nAny failure of major elements could lead to significant disruptions in the ability to serve customers, which could damage our reputation, reduce our revenues or otherwise harm our business.\nOur business is dependent upon providing customers with fast, efficient and reliable services. A reduction in the performance, reliability or availability of required network infrastructure may harm our ability to distribute content to our customers, as well as our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers. Our content management software solutions and operations are susceptible to, and could be damaged or interrupted by outages caused by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, Internet or mobile network breakdown, earthquake and similar events. Our solutions are also subject to human error, security breaches, power losses, computer viruses, break-ins, \u201cdenial of service\u201d attacks, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and tampering designed to disrupt our computer systems and network communications. Our failure to protect our network against damage from any of these events could harm our business.\nOur operations also depend on web browsers, ISPs (Internet service providers) and mobile networks to provide our customers\u2019 end-users with access to websites, streaming and mobile content. Many of these providers have experienced outages in the past, and could experience outages, delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our solutions. Any such outage, delay or difficulty could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which would harm our business.\nIf we lose access to third-party licenses, our software product development and production may be delayed or we may incur additional expense to modify our products or products in development.\nSome of our solutions contain software licensed from third parties. Third-party licensing arrangements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nundetected errors or unauthorized use of another person\u2019s code in the third party\u2019s software;\n\u2022\ndisagreement over the scope of the license and other key terms, such as royalties payable;\n\u2022\ninfringement actions brought by third-party licensees;\n\u2022\nthat third parties will create solutions that directly compete with our products; and\n\u2022\ntermination or expiration of the license.\nBecause of these risks, some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or allow our products to remain competitive. The loss of these licenses or the inability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or impair the functionality or enhancement of existing products, leading to increased expense associated with licenses of third-party software or development of alternative software to provide comparable functionality for our existing products and modification of our existing products. Further, if we lose or are unable to maintain any of these third-party licenses or are required to modify software obtained under third-party licenses, it could delay the release of new products, delay enhancements to our existing products or delay sales of our existing products. Any delays could result in loss of competitive position, loss of sales and loss of customer confidence, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the limited amount of open source software that is incorporated into our products were to become unavailable or if we violate the terms of open source licenses, it could adversely affect sales of our products, which could disrupt our business and harm our financial results.\nOur products incorporate a limited amount of \u201copen source\u201d software. Open source software is made available to us and to the public by its authors or other third parties under licenses that impose certain obligations on licensees that re-distribute or make derivative works of the open source software. We may not be able to replace the functionality provided by the open source software currently incorporated in our products if that software becomes unavailable, obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products. In addition, we must carefully monitor our compliance with the licensing requirements applicable to that open source software. If we have failed or if in the future we fail to comply with the applicable license requirements, we might lose the right to use the subject open source software. The terms of some open source licenses would require us to give our customers significant rights to open source software that is subject to those licenses and is incorporated in our products. This would include the right to obtain from us the source code form of that open source software, and the right to use, modify and distribute that open source\nsoftware to others. We may be required to provide these rights to customers on a royalty-free basis. Those rights might also extend to modifications and additions we make to the subject open source software. That open source software, and those modifications and additions, also might be obtained by our competitors and used in competing products.\nThe enforceability and interpretation of open source licenses remains uncertain under applicable law. Unfavorable court decisions could require us to replace open source software incorporated in our products. In some cases this might require us to obtain licenses to commercial software under terms that restrict our use of that commercial software and require us to pay royalties. In some cases we might need to redesign our software products, or to discontinue the sale of our software products if a redesign could not be accomplished on a timely basis. These same consequences result if our use of any open source software or commercial software is found to infringe any intellectual property right of another party. Any of these occurrences would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe sell a significant portion of our products internationally, which exposes us to risks associated with international operations.\nWe sell a significant amount of our products to customers outside the United States, particularly in Europe and Asia. International sales accounted for 15% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, 25% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 12% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012. We expect that sales to international customers, including customers in Europe and Asia, will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales. Sales outside the United States involve the following risks, among others:\n\u2022\ninternational governments may impose tariffs, quotas and taxes;\n\u2022\nthe demand for our products will depend, in part, on local economic health;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability may reduce demand for our products;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate our ability to sell in certain markets;\n\u2022\npotentially limited intellectual property protection in certain countries may limit our recourse against infringing products or cause us to refrain from selling in certain markets;\n\u2022\npotential difficulties in managing our international operations;\n\u2022\nthe burden and cost of complying with a variety of international laws, including those relating to data security and privacy;\n\u2022\nwe may decide to price our products in foreign currency denominations;\n\u2022\nour contracts with international channel partners cannot fully protect us against political and economic instability;\n\u2022\npotential difficulties in collecting receivables; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to control our international channel partners\u2019 efforts on our behalf.\nThe financial results of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation with our overall financial results. Currency translations and fluctuations may adversely affect the financial performance of our consolidated operations. Currency fluctuations may also increase the relative price of our product in international markets and thereby could also cause our products to become less affordable or less price competitive than those of international manufacturers. These risks associated with international operations may have a material adverse effect on our revenue from or costs associated with international sales.\nIf our domestic or international intellectual property rights are not adequately protected, others may offer products similar to ours or independently develop the same or similar technologies or otherwise obtain access to our technology and trade secrets which could depress our product selling prices and gross profit or result in loss of market share.\nWe believe that protecting our proprietary technology is important to our success and competitive positioning. In addition to common law intellectual property rights, we rely on patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. However, these legal means afford us only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or remedies to gain or keep any advantages we may have over our competitors.\nOur competitors, who may have or could develop or acquire significant resources, may make substantial investments in competing technologies, or may apply for and obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to develop or market our products. Further, although we do not believe that any of our products infringe on the rights of others, third parties have claimed, and may claim in the future, that our products infringe on their rights, and these third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future.\nCostly litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or \u201cknow-how\u201d we own, to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the ownership, scope, or validity of our proprietary rights and the rights of others. Any claim of infringement against us may involve significant liabilities to third parties, could require us to seek licenses from third parties, and could prevent us from manufacturing, selling, or using our products. The occurrence of this litigation, or the effect of an adverse determination in any of this type of litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property to the same extent as the United States or at all. Our failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in laws and regulations related to the Internet or changes in the Internet infrastructure itself may diminish the demand for our products, and could have a negative impact on our business.\nThe future success of our business depends in part upon the continued use of the Internet as a primary medium for commerce, communication and business applications. Federal, state or international government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of the Internet as a commercial medium. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our products in order to comply with these changes. In addition, government agencies or private organizations may begin to impose taxes, fees or other charges for accessing the Internet or commerce conducted via the Internet. These laws or charges could limit the growth of Internet-related commerce or communications generally, or result in reductions in the demand for Internet-based applications such as ours. The adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet could limit the growth of the video as a mainstream communication and collaboration tool, limit the market for video content management software generally, and limit the demand for our products.\nIn addition, the use of the Internet as a business tool could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of Internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease of use, accessibility, and quality of service. The performance of the Internet and its acceptance as a business tool has been adversely affected by \u201cviruses,\u201d \u201cworms\u201d and similar malicious programs and the Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure. If the use of the Internet is adversely affected by these issues, demand for our applications could suffer.\nExpanding laws, regulations and customer requirements relating to data security and privacy may adversely affect sales of our products and result in increased compliance costs.\nOur customers can use our products to collect, use and store personal or identifying information regarding their employees, customers and suppliers. Federal, state and international government bodies and agencies have adopted, are considering adopting, or may adopt laws and regulations regarding data security, privacy and the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals. These laws and regulations could reduce the demand for our software products if we fail to design or enhance our products to enable our customers to comply with the privacy and security measures required by the legislation.\nWe also must comply with the policies, procedures and business requirements of our customers relating to data privacy and security, which can vary based upon the customer, the customer\u2019s industry or location, and the product the customer selects, and which may be more restrictive than the privacy and security measures required by law or regulation. In particular, the European Union and many countries in Europe have stringent privacy laws and regulations, which may impact our ability to profitably operate in certain European countries or to offer products that meet the needs of customers subject to European Union privacy laws and regulations.\nThe costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, our customers\u2019 own requirements and the privacy and security laws and regulations that are applicable to our customers\u2019 businesses may limit the use and adoption of our products and reduce overall demand. Non-compliance with our customers\u2019 specific requirements may lead to termination of contracts with these customers or liabilities to the customers; non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations may lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities.\nFurthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers\u2019 workers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our products effectively. If a customer experiences a significant data security breach involving our software products, our customers could lose confidence in our software\u2019s ability to protect the personal information of their employees, customers and suppliers, which could cause our customers to discontinue use of our products. The loss of confidence from a significant data security breach involving our software products could hurt our reputation, cause sales and marketing challenges to existing and new customers, cause loss of market share or exacerbate competitive pressures, result in an increase in our development costs to address any potential vulnerabilities in our software products, and may result in reduced demand and revenue. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our products in certain industries.\nDomestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives and our customers\u2019 privacy policies and practices may adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to process, handle, store, use and transmit demographic and personal information from their employees, customers and suppliers, which could reduce demand for our products.\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our software products. If the processing of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner, our software products would be less effective, which may reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business.\nWe may experience significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in our results of operations due to a number of factors and these fluctuations may negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. With the sale of the disc publishing business on July 1, 2014, there may be even wider fluctuations in our results of operations given the smaller size of our retained software business. This variability may lead to volatility in our stock price as research analysts and investors respond to quarterly fluctuations and this volatility may be exacerbated by the relatively illiquid nature of our common stock. In addition, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-period basis, particularly on a sequential quarterly basis, may not be meaningful. Further, a comparison to our results of operations in periods prior to our acquisition of Qumu, Inc. in October 2011 will not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.\nFactors that may affect our results of operations include:\n\u2022\nthe number and mix of products and solutions sold in the period;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of our recorded revenue, which will depend upon the mix of products and solutions selected by our customers with revenue from paid-up perpetual software licenses being recognized upon delivery, revenue from term software licenses recognized over the term of the contract, and revenue from cloud-hosted services recognized over the term of the subscription agreement;\n\u2022\ntiming of customer purchase commitments, including the impact of long sales cycles and seasonal buying patterns;\n\u2022\nvariability in the size of customer purchases and the impact of large customer orders on a particular period;\n\u2022\nthe timing of major development projects and market launch of new products or improvements to existing products;\n\u2022\nreductions in our customers\u2019 budgets for information technology purchases and delays in their purchasing cycles, due to changing global economic or market conditions;\n\u2022\nthe impact to the marketplace of competitive products and pricing;\n\u2022\nthe timing and level of operating expenses;\n\u2022\nthe impact on revenue and expenses of acquisitions by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nfuture accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of a recession or any other adverse global economic conditions on our business, including uncertainties that may cause a delay in entering into or a failure to enter into significant customer agreements.\nThe foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations. Failure to achieve our quarterly or annual forecasts or to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors may cause our stock price to decline abruptly and significantly.\nThe limited liquidity for our common stock could affect your ability to sell your shares at a satisfactory price.\nOur common stock is relatively illiquid. As of December 31, 2014, we had 9,127,425 shares of common stock outstanding. The average daily trading volume in our common stock, as reported by the Nasdaq Stock Market, for the 64 trading days beginning October 1, 2014 and ending December 31, 2014 was approximately 16,100 shares. A more active public market for our common stock may not develop, which could adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of our common stock. Moreover, a thin trading market for our stock could cause the market price for our common stock to fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a larger float, our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile. In addition, in the absence of an active public trading market, shareholders may be unable to liquidate their shares of our common stock at a satisfactory price.\nProvisions of Minnesota law, our bylaws and other agreements may deter a change of control of our company and may have a possible negative effect on our stock price.\nCertain provisions of Minnesota law, our bylaws and other agreements may make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire, or discourage a third-party from attempting to acquire, control of our company, including:\n\u2022\nthe provisions of Minnesota law relating to business combinations and control share acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe provisions of our bylaws regarding the business properly brought before shareholders;\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors to establish more than one class or series of shares and to fix the relative rights and preferences of any such different classes or series;\n\u2022\nthe provisions of our stock option plans allowing for the acceleration of vesting or payments of awards granted under the plans in the event of specified events that result in a \u201cchange in control\u201d;\n\u2022\nthe provisions of our long-term incentive (LTI) program and agreements that require payment of LTI bonus amounts in the event of a \u201cchange in control\u201d; and\n\u2022\nthe provisions of our agreements provide for severance payments to our executive officers in the event of certain terminations following a \u201cchange in control.\u201d\nThese measures could discourage or prevent a takeover of our company or changes in our management, even if an acquisition or such changes would be beneficial to our shareholders. This may have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses and will constitute a larger percentage of our annual revenue than prior to the sale of the disc publishing business.\nKeeping abreast of, and in compliance with, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public company disclosure requirements, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and in particular Section 404 of that Act relating to management certification of internal controls, new disclosures relating to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d, the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market have required an increased amount of management attention and external resources. We intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving corporate governance and public disclosure standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. While all public companies face the costs and burdens associated with being public companies, the costs and burden of being a public company will be a significant portion of our annual revenues, which have been reduced following the sale of the disc publishing business on July 1, 2014.", "PERMNO": 78054, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "QUMU"}
