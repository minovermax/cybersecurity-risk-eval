{"cik": "1159281", "company": "FIVE STAR QUALITY CARE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face but are risks we believe material at this time. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, may also impair our business operations or financial results. If any of the events or circumstances described below occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations and the market price of our securities could decline. Investors and prospective investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading \u201cWarning Concerning Forward Looking Statements\u201d before deciding whether to invest in our securities.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nA small percentage decline in our revenues or increase in our expenses could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe have high operating leverage. As a result, a small percentage decline in our revenues or increase in our expenses could have a material adverse impact on our operating results because some of our fixed costs, such as our base rent, would not decrease during times of lower revenues and could not be reduced to offset other expenses which may be increasing.\nCircumstances that adversely affect the ability of seniors or their families to pay for our services could cause our occupancy rates, revenues and results of operations to decline.\nAs further discussed below, government benefits, such as Medicare and Medicaid, are not generally available for services at independent and assisted living communities. Many seniors are not otherwise able to pay our monthly resident fees with private resources. Our residents paid approximately 78% of our senior living revenues from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2016 from their private resources, and we expect to continue to rely on the ability of our residents to pay for our services from their own financial resources. Economic downturns, softness in the U.S. housing market, higher levels of unemployment among resident family members, lower levels of consumer confidence, stock market volatility and/or changes in demographics could adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford our resident fees or entrance fees. If we are unable to retain and/or attract seniors with sufficient income, assets or other resources required to pay the fees associated with independent and assisted living services and other service offerings, our occupancy rates, revenues and results of operations could decline.\nU.S. housing market conditions and the current trend for seniors to delay moving to senior living communities until they require greater care could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDownturns or stagnation in the U.S. housing market could adversely affect the ability, or perceived ability, of seniors to afford our entrance fees and resident fees as prospective residents frequently use the proceeds from the sale of their homes to cover the cost of such fees. If seniors have a difficult time selling their homes, their ability to relocate to our senior living communities or finance their stays at our senior living communities with private resources could be adversely affected. Also, seniors have been increasingly delaying their moves to senior living communities, including to our senior living communities, until they require greater care. Further, rehabilitation therapy and other services are increasingly being provided to seniors on an outpatient basis or in seniors\u2019 personal residences in response to market demand and government regulation, which may increase the trend for seniors to delay moving to senior living communities. Such delays may cause decreases in our occupancy rates and increases in our resident turnover rates. Moreover, older aged persons may have greater care needs and require higher acuity services, which may increase our cost of business, expose us to additional liability or result in lost business and shorter stays at our senior living communities if we are not able to provide the requisite care services or fail to adequately provide those services. If such volatile U.S. housing market conditions and senior living moving trends continue for a protracted period, our occupancy rates, revenues, cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nThe failure of Medicare and Medicaid rates to match our costs will reduce our income or create losses.\nSome of our current operations, especially our SNFs, receive significant revenues from Medicare and Medicaid. We derived approximately 22% of our senior living revenues from continuing operations from these programs, for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Payments under Medicare and Medicaid are set by government policy, laws and regulations. The rates and amounts of these payments are subject to periodic adjustment. Current and projected federal budget deficits, federal spending priorities and challenging state fiscal conditions have resulted in numerous recent legislative and regulatory actions or proposed actions with respect to Medicare and Medicaid payments, insurance and healthcare delivery. Examples of these, and other information regarding such matters and developments, are provided under the caption \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation and Reimbursement\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We cannot estimate the type and magnitude of these matters. However, these matters could result in the failure of Medicare or Medicaid payment rates to cover our costs of providing required services to residents, or in reductions in payments to us or other circumstances that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPrivate third party payers continue to try to reduce healthcare costs.\nPrivate third party payers such as insurance companies continue their efforts to control healthcare costs through direct contracts with healthcare providers, increased utilization review practices and greater enrollment in managed care programs and\npreferred provider organizations. These third party payers increasingly demand discounted fee structures and the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk. These efforts of third party payers to limit the amount of payments we receive for healthcare services could adversely affect us. Reimbursement payments under third party payer programs may not remain at levels comparable to present levels or be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients participating in such programs. Future changes in, or renegotiations of, the reimbursement rates or methods of third party payers, or the implementation of other measures to reduce payments for our services could result in a substantial reduction in our net operating revenues. At the same time, as a result of competitive pressures, our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to private pay residents may be limited.\nProvisions of the ACA and proposals to repeal and replace the ACA could reduce our income and increase our costs.\nThe ACA contains insurance changes, payment changes and healthcare delivery systems changes that have affected, and will continue to affect, us unless such changes are repealed and replaced. The ACA provides for multiple reductions to the annual market basket updates for inflation that may result in reductions in SNF Medicare payment rates. In addition, certain provisions of the ACA that affect employers generally, including the employer shared responsibility provisions that went into effect on January 1, 2015, may have an impact on the design and cost of the health coverage that we offer to our employees. We are unable to predict the impact of the ACA on our future financial results of operations, but it may be adverse and material. In addition, maintaining compliance with the ACA will require us to expend management time and financial resources.\nThe ACA also established an Independent Payment Advisory Board to submit legislative proposals to Congress and take other actions with a goal of reducing Medicare spending growth. When and if such spending reductions take effect, they may be adverse and material to our financial results. The ACA includes other changes that may affect us, such as enforcement reforms and Medicare and Medicaid program integrity control initiatives, new compliance, ethics and public disclosure requirements, initiatives to encourage the development of home and community based long term care services rather than institutional services under Medicaid, value based purchasing plans and a Medicare post acute care pilot program to develop and evaluate making a bundled payment for services, including physician and SNF services, provided during an episode of care. We are unable to predict the impact on us of the insurance, payment, and healthcare delivery systems reforms contained in and to be developed pursuant to the ACA. If the changes implemented under the ACA result in reduced payments for our services or the failure of Medicare, Medicaid or insurance payment rates to cover our increasing costs, our future financial results could be adversely and materially affected.\nIn addition, to the extent the ACA is repealed or changed under the new Trump Administration and the 115th Congress, additional risks and regulatory uncertainty may arise. Depending upon what aspects of the ACA are repealed and whether and how they are replaced, our future financial results could be adversely and materially affected.\nIncreases in our labor costs may have a material adverse effect on us.\nWages and employee benefits associated with our continuing operations were approximately 42% of our 2016 total operating expenses. We compete with other senior living community operators, among others, to attract and retain qualified personnel responsible for the day to day operations of our senior living communities. The market for qualified nurses, therapists and other healthcare professionals is highly competitive, and periodic or geographic area shortages of such healthcare professionals may require us to increase the wages and benefits we offer to our employees in order to attract and retain such personnel or to utilize temporary personnel at an increased cost. In addition, employee benefit costs, including health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation insurance costs, have materially increased in recent years and, as noted above, we cannot predict the future impact of the ACA, or the repeal or replacement of the ACA, on the cost of employee health insurance. Although we determine our employee health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation self insurance reserves with guidance from third party professionals, our reserves may nonetheless be inadequate. Increasing employee health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation insurance costs and increasing self insurance reserves for labor related insurance may materially and adversely affect our earnings.\nWe cannot be sure that our labor costs will not increase or that any increases will be recovered by corresponding increases in the rates we charge to our residents or otherwise. Any significant failure by us to control labor costs or to pass any increases on to residents through rate increases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, increased costs charged to our residents may reduce our occupancy and growth.\nFederal, state and local employment related laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business, and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local employment related laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, the Family and Medical Leave Act, overtime pay, compensable time, recordkeeping and other working conditions, and a variety of similar laws that govern these and other employment related matters. Because labor represents a significant portion of our operating expenses, compliance with these evolving laws and regulations could substantially increase our cost of doing business, while failure to do so could subject us to significant back pay awards, fines and lawsuits. We are currently subject to employee-related claims in connection with our operations. These claims, lawsuits and proceedings are in various stages of adjudication or investigation and involve a wide variety of claims and potential outcomes. Our failure to comply with federal, state and local employment related laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation which increases our costs and may result in losses.\nLicensing and Medicare and Medicaid laws require operators of senior living communities and rehabilitation and wellness clinics to comply with extensive standards governing operations and physical environments. Federal and state laws also prohibit fraud and abuse by senior living providers and rehabilitation and wellness clinic operators, including civil and criminal laws that prohibit false claims and regulate patient referrals in Medicare, Medicaid and other payer programs. In recent years, federal and state governments have devoted increased resources to monitoring the quality of care at senior living communities and to anti-fraud investigations in healthcare generally. CMS contractors are expanding the retroactive audits of Medicare claims submitted by SNFs and other providers, and recouping alleged overpayments for services determined by auditors not to have been medically necessary or not to meet Medicare coverage criteria as billed. State Medicaid programs and other third party payers are conducting similar medical necessity and compliance audits. When federal or state agencies identify violations of anti-fraud, false claims, anti-kickback and physician referral laws, they may impose or seek civil or criminal penalties, treble damages and other government sanctions, and may revoke the community\u2019s license or make conditional or exclude the community from Medicare or Medicaid participation. The ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers, and for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations. In addition, when these agencies determine that there has been quality of care deficiencies or improper billing, they may impose or seek various remedies or sanctions, including denial of new admissions, exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid program participation, monetary penalties, restitution of overpayments, government oversight, temporary management, loss of licensure and criminal penalties. Current state laws and regulations allow enforcement officials to make determinations as to whether the care provided at our communities exceeds the level of care for which a particular community is licensed. A finding that a community is delivering care beyond the scope of its license could result in closure of the facility and the immediate discharge and transfer of residents. Certain states and the federal government may determine that citations relating to one community affect other communities operated by the same entity or related entities, which may negatively impact an operator\u2019s ability to maintain or renew other licenses or Medicare or Medicaid certifications or to secure new licenses or certifications. In addition, revocation of a license or certification at one community could impact our ability to obtain new licenses or certifications or to maintain or renew existing licenses and certifications at other communities, and trigger defaults under our leases, our management agreements with SNH and our new credit facility, or adversely affect our ability to operate or obtain financing in the future.\nOur communities incur sanctions and penalties from time to time. As a result of the healthcare industry\u2019s extensive regulatory system and increasing enforcement initiatives, we have experienced increased costs for monitoring quality of care compliance, billing procedures and compliance with referral laws and other laws that apply to us, and we expect these costs may continue to increase. For example, as previously disclosed and disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as a result of our compliance program to review medical records related to our Medicare billing practices, during 2014 we discovered potentially inadequate documentation and other issues at one of our leased SNFs. This compliance review was not initiated in response to any specific complaint or allegation, but was a review of the type that we periodically undertake to test our own compliance with applicable Medicare billing rules. As a result of these discoveries, in February 2015, we made a voluntary disclosure of deficiencies to the OIG pursuant to the OIG\u2019s Provider Self-Disclosure Protocol. We completed our investigation and assessment of these matters and submitted a final supplemental disclosure to the OIG in May 2015. In June 2016, we settled this matter with the OIG and agreed to pay approximately $8.6 million in exchange for a customary release but did not admit any liability.\nThe revenues we receive from Medicare and Medicaid may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments or set offs, administrative rulings and policy interpretations, and payment\ndelays. If we become subject to additional regulatory sanctions or repayment obligations at any of our existing communities (or at any of our newly acquired communities with prior deficiencies that we are unable to correct or resolve), our business may be adversely affected, and we might experience financial losses. Any adverse determination concerning any of our licenses or eligibility for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement or any penalties, repayments, or sanctions, and the increasing costs of required compliance with applicable federal and state laws, may adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to litigation and regulatory and government proceedings.\nWe have been, are currently, and expect in the future to be involved in claims, lawsuits and regulatory and government audits, investigations and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, some of which may involve material amounts. For example, we were defendants in a lawsuit filed by the estate of a former resident of a senior living community operated by us in which a verdict was rendered against us awarding damages of approximately $19.2 million, which consisted of $2.5 million for pain and suffering and the remainder in punitive damages. In March 2016, pursuant to a settlement agreement we entered into with the plaintiff, approximately $7.3 million was paid to the plaintiff, of which approximately $3.0 million was paid by our liability insurer and the balance by us. We believe our liability insurer may be financially responsible for more than $3.0 million and we are seeking additional payments from our liability insurer; however, we cannot predict the outcome of our ongoing negotiations or potential future litigation with our liability insurer. The defense and resolution of such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings may require us to incur significant expenses.\nIn several well publicized instances, private litigation by residents of senior living communities for alleged abuses has resulted in large damage awards against other senior living companies. Some lawyers and law firms specialize in bringing litigation against senior living community operators. As a result of this litigation and potential litigation, the cost of our liability insurance continues to increase. Medical liability insurance reform has at times been a topic of political debate, and some states have enacted legislation to limit future liability awards. However, such reforms have not generally been adopted, and we expect our insurance costs may continue to increase. Further, although we determine our self insurance reserves with guidance from third party professionals, our reserves may nonetheless be inadequate. Increasing liability insurance costs and increasing self insurance reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not achieve and maintain high quality of care, payments through pay-for-performance and value-based purchasing programs may be reduced, and the overall attractiveness of our senior living communities to potential residents could decrease as more quality data becomes publicly available.\nAs noted above, CMS is moving towards pay-for-performance programs, such as value-based payment. In October 2016, CMS issued a final rule to implement the Quality Payment Program. These reforms were mandated under MACRA and replace the SGR methodology for updates to the MPFS to which our Medicare outpatient therapy rates are tied. Starting in 2019, providers may be subject to either MIPS payment adjustments or APM incentive payments. Under PAMA, beginning in federal fiscal year 2019, Medicare payment rates will be partially based on SNFs\u2019 performance scores on a hospital readmissions measure as part of CMS\u2019s new SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program. Moreover, under the IMPACT Act, HHS will require SNFs to begin reporting certain quality measures and resource use measures in a standardized and interoperable format by October 1, 2016 and begin reporting certain patient assessment data in such a format by October 1, 2018. Under the SNF Quality Reporting Program, beginning in federal fiscal year 2018, SNFs that fail to comply with the reporting requirements by the established times will be subject to a 2.0% reduction in their Medicare payment rates for that fiscal year. Beginning October 1, 2018, HHS will make this data publicly available. We cannot predict the impact of these quality-driven payment reforms, but they may be material to and adversely affect our future results of operations. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of more quality data becoming publicly available, but if we do not achieve and maintain high quality of care, the overall attractiveness of our communities to potential residents could decrease.\nOur growth strategy may not succeed.\nWe intend to continue to grow our business through acquisitions and by entering into additional long term lease and management arrangements for senior living communities where residents\u2019 private resources account for all or a large majority of revenues. Our business plan includes seeking to take advantage of expected long term increases in demand for senior living communities. Our growth strategy is subject to risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to identify and make profitable acquisitions of additional senior living communities or to identify and lease or manage additional senior living communities on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to access the capital required to fund acquisitions or to operate additional senior living communities;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to identify and operate or manage additional senior living communities where residents\u2019 private resources account for all or a large majority of revenues;\n\u2022\nwe may not achieve the operating results we expect from newly acquired, leased or managed senior living communities;\n\u2022\nthe operations of newly acquired, leased or managed senior living communities may subject us to unanticipated contingent liabilities or regulatory matters;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to make significant capital expenditures to improve newly acquired, leased or managed senior living communities, including capital expenditures that were unanticipated at the time of acquisition or entry into the lease or management arrangements;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty retaining key employees and other personnel at newly acquired, leased or managed senior living communities;\n\u2022\nto the extent we incur debt in connection with acquisitions or incur additional lease obligations associated with new leased senior living communities, our operating leverage and resulting risks of debt defaults may increase;\n\u2022\nthe occupancy at newly acquired, leased or managed senior living communities may decline and it may take a period of time to stabilize the operations of newly acquired, leased or managed senior living communities;\n\u2022\nintegrating the operations of newly acquired, leased or managed senior living communities may disrupt our existing operations, or may cost more than anticipated;\n\u2022\nwe may acquire or agree to lease or manage senior living communities subject to unknown liabilities and without any recourse, or with limited recourse, such as liability for the cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination or for claims by residents, vendors or other persons related to actions taken by former owners or operators of the communities;\n\u2022\nany failure to comply with licensing requirements at our senior living communities may prevent our obtaining licenses for, or renewing licenses at, senior living communities we want to acquire, lease or manage; and\n\u2022\nnewly acquired, leased or managed senior living communities might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business.\nFor these reasons, among others, we might not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or additional long term lease and management arrangements, and our growth strategy may not succeed and may cause us to experience losses.\nWe have not been consistently profitable, and we have limited resources and substantial lease obligations.\nWe have not been consistently profitable since we became a public company in 2001, and we currently have limited resources and substantial lease obligations. Given our history of losses, we cannot be sure that we will be able to achieve and/or maintain profitability in the future. If we are unable to effectively manage our operations and cash flow, or achieve profitability in other ways, the market price of our common shares may be adversely affected.\nCurrent government policies regarding interest rates and trade policies may cause a recession.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve policy regarding the timing and amount of future increases in interest rates, changing U.S. and other countries\u2019 trade policies and declining foreign economic conditions and markets may hinder the growth of the U.S. economy. It is unclear whether the U.S. economy will be able to withstand these market challenges and global uncertainty and achieve meaningful and sustained growth. Economic weakness in the U.S. economy generally or a new U.S. recession would likely adversely affect our financial condition, including by limiting our ability to pay rent and causing the value of our owned and operated senior living communities to decline. Further, general economic conditions, such as inflation, commodity costs, fuel and other energy costs, costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, interest rates, and tax rates, affect our operating and general and administrative expenses, and we have no control or limited ability to control such factors. Such economic\nuncertainties and conditions may adversely affect us and others, including our landlords and our residents and prospective residents, such as by reducing access to funding or credit, increasing the cost of credit, limiting the ability to manage interest rate risk and increasing the risk that obligations will not be fulfilled, as well as other impacts which we are unable to fully anticipate.\nWe may be unable to use our federal net operating loss or tax credit carry forwards before they expire, or our ability to use our federal net operating loss or tax credit carry forwards may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2016, after reduction for the amounts utilized to offset federal taxable income in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, our federal net operating loss carry forwards, which are scheduled to begin expiring in 2026 if unused, were approximately $71.2 million, and our tax credit carry forwards, which begin expiring in 2022 if unused, were approximately $21.6 million. If in the future we use our federal net operating loss or tax credit carry forwards to reduce our tax liabilities, the existence and amounts of these federal net operating loss or tax credit carry forwards may be subject to audit by the relevant tax authorities and the amounts of these federal net operating loss or tax credit carry forwards may be reduced.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, or the IRC, our ability to use our federal net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards is limited if we undergo a change in ownership of more than 50% of our capital stock over a three year period. These change in ownership rules generally focus on ownership changes involving \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined in the applicable treasury regulations promulgated under the IRC), including those arising from new stock issuances and other equity transactions. Our bylaws contain certain provisions to facilitate the preservation of the tax treatment of our net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards, including provisions generally prohibiting a person or group from becoming a \u201c5-percent shareholder\u201d without the consent of our Board of Directors. In November 2016, with the consent of our Board of Directors, ABP Acquisition LLC and certain related parties acquired 17,999,999 of our common shares, or approximately 36% of our common shares. Although this acquisition did not limit our ability to use our federal net operating loss or tax credit carry forwards, it limits the extent to which potential future acquisitions of our common shares by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d may be made without limiting our ability to use our federal net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.\nThe credit agreement governing our new credit facility contains terms limiting our ability to incur additional debt. These terms, or our failure or inability to meet them, could adversely affect our business.\nThe agreement governing our new credit facility, or our credit agreement, includes various conditions to our borrowing, financial and other covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain certain minimum debt service coverage and leverage ratios, and events of default. We may not be able to satisfy all of these conditions or may default on some of these covenants for various reasons, including for reasons beyond our control. Complying with these covenants may limit our ability to take actions that may be beneficial to us and our stockholders. Further, if we are unable to borrow under our new credit facility, we may be unable to meet our obligations or grow our business by acquiring senior living communities.\nIf we default under our credit agreement, our lenders may demand immediate payment of any amount outstanding and may elect not to fund future borrowings. Any such default would likely have serious and adverse consequences to us and would likely cause the market price of our common shares to decline.\nWe may obtain additional debt financing in the future. The covenants and conditions which apply to any such future indebtedness may be more restrictive than the covenants and conditions contained in our credit agreement.\nSuccessful union organization of our employees may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time labor unions attempt to organize our employees. If federal legislation modifies the labor laws to make it easier for employee groups to unionize, additional groups of employees may seek union representation. If our employees were to unionize, it could result in business interruptions, work stoppages, the degradation of service levels due to work rules, or increased operating expenses that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely impacted if there are deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While our management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will be effective in\naccomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weaknesses, in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could result in misstatements of our results of operations or our financial statements or could otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nFailure to comply with laws governing the privacy and security of personal information, including relating to health, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to comply with federal and state laws governing the privacy, security, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information, including information relating to health. Under HIPAA and the HITECH Act, as updated by the HIPAA Omnibus Rule, we are required to comply with the HIPAA privacy rule, security standards and standards for electronic healthcare transactions. State laws also govern the privacy of individual health information, and rules regarding state privacy rights may be more stringent than HIPAA. Other federal and state laws govern the privacy of other personal information. If we fail to comply with applicable federal or state standards, we could be subject to civil sanctions and criminal penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. HIPAA enforcement efforts have increased considerably over the past few years, with HHS, through its Office for Civil Rights, entering into several multi-million dollar HIPAA settlements in 2016 alone.\nWe rely on information technology networks and related systems, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of those networks and systems could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur information technology networks and related systems are essential to our ability to perform our day to day operations. As a result, we face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to emails, persons who access our systems from inside or outside our organization and other significant disruptions of our information technology networks and related systems. A security breach or other significant disruption involving our information technology networks and related systems could disrupt our operations; result in the unauthorized access to, and the destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, personally identifiable, protected health, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information, which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage claims by third parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our business relationships or reputation generally. Any or all of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect us.\nAlthough we take various actions to maintain the security and integrity of our information technology networks and related systems, and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, we cannot be sure that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that any attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed to not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures. It is therefore not possible for this risk to be entirely mitigated.\nOur business requires us to make significant capital expenditures to maintain and improve our senior living communities.\nOur senior living communities sometimes require significant expenditures to address required ongoing maintenance or to make them more attractive to residents. Physical characteristics of senior living communities are mandated by various government authorities; changes in these regulations may require us to make significant expenditures. In addition, we are often required to make significant capital expenditures when we acquire, lease or manage new senior living communities. Our available financial resources may be insufficient to fund these expenditures. SNH has historically provided most of the capital required to improve the senior living communities we lease from them or manage for their account. However, when SNH funds capital expenditures at our leased senior living communities our rent increases, and when SNH funds capital expenditures at our managed senior living communities the invested capital upon which SNH\u2019s returns are based increases. We may be unable to pay increased rent at our leased senior living communities without experiencing losses and increases in SNH\u2019s invested capital at our managed communities may reduce or prevent our receipt of incentive fees or subject the applicable management agreements to termination by SNH if it is unable to realize its return on invested capital under such agreements.\nWe face significant competition.\nWe compete with numerous other senior living community operators, as well as companies that provide senior living services, such as home healthcare companies and other real estate based service providers. Some of our existing competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than us and some of our competitors are not for profit entities which have endowment income and may not face the same financial pressures that we do. We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract a sufficient number of residents to our senior living communities at rates that will generate acceptable returns or that we will be able to attract employees and keep wages and other employee benefits, insurance costs and other operating expenses at levels which will allow us to compete successfully and operate profitably.\nIn recent years, a significant number of new senior living communities have been developed, and we expect this increased development activity to continue in the future. This development activity has increased competitive pressures on us, particularly in the geographic markets where this development activity has been most focused, including Arizona, Georgia and Texas. These competitive pressures may prevent us from maintaining or improving occupancy and rates at our senior living communities, which may adversely affect their profitability and therefore negatively impact our revenues, cash flows and results from operations.\nIncreased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur total consolidated long term debt as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $58.5 million and represented approximately 26% of our total book capitalization as of that date. We also had approximately $1.9 million of short term mortgage debt. In addition to our indebtedness, we have substantial lease and other obligations.\nOur level of indebtedness and substantial lease and other obligations could impact our business in the following ways, among others:\n\u2022\nour ability to satisfy our debt obligations could be affected;\n\u2022\nthe funds required to make interest and principal payments will not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing may be impaired\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry may be limited; and\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to downturns in our business and industry or the economy generally.\nIncreasing interest rates may adversely affect us.\nSince the most recent U.S. economic recession, the U.S. Federal Reserve has taken actions that have resulted in low interest rates for a long period of time. In December 2016, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, and market interest rates rose after the recent presidential election in anticipation of possible increased government spending and inflation. Market interest rates may continue to increase, and increases may materially and negatively affect us in several ways, including:\n\u2022\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely impact the housing market and reduce demand for our services and occupancy at our senior living communities, could increase our rent expense at our leased senior living communities due to the landlord setting rent based on a required return on its investment, and could reduce the likelihood that we will earn incentive fees at our managed senior living communities due to the owner requiring a minimum return on its investment prior to our being eligible to receive an incentive fee.\n\u2022\nAmounts outstanding under our new credit facility require interest to be paid at variable interest rates. When interest rates increase, our interest costs will increase, which could adversely affect our cash flow, our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our cost of refinancing our debt when it becomes due and our ability to fund our operations and working capital. Additionally, if we choose to hedge our interest rate risk, we cannot be sure that the hedge will be effective or that any hedging counterparty will meet its obligations to us.\n\u2022\nAn increase in interest rates could decrease the amount buyers may be willing to pay for our senior living communities, thereby reducing the market value of our senior living communities and limiting our ability to sell\nsenior living communities. Further, increased interest rates would increase our costs for, and may limit our ability to obtain, mortgage financing secured by our senior living communities. Further, increased interest rates may effectively increase the cost of senior living communities we acquire to the extent we utilize leverage for those acquisitions and may result in a reduction in our acquisitions to the extent we reduce the amount we offer to pay for senior living communities, due to the effect of increased interest rates, to a price that sellers may not accept.\n\u2022\nIncreased interest rates may increase our operating costs to the extent we utilize financing, such as borrowings under our new credit facility, to fund our operations.\nTermination of assisted living resident agreements and resident attrition could adversely affect our revenues and earnings.\nState regulations governing assisted living communities typically require a written resident agreement with each resident. Most of these regulations also require that each resident have the right to terminate these assisted living resident agreements for any reason on reasonable notice. Consistent with these regulations, most of our resident agreements allow residents to terminate their agreements on 30 days\u2019 notice. Thus, we may be unable to contract with assisted living residents to stay for longer periods of time, unlike typical apartment leasing arrangements that involve lease agreements with terms of up to a year or longer. If a large number of residents elected to terminate their resident agreements at or around the same time, our revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the advanced ages of our senior living residents make resident turnover rates difficult to predict.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and climate change risks.\nOur operations are subject to risks associated with environmental hazards. We may be liable for environmental hazards at, or migrating from, the properties on which our owned, leased and managed senior living communities are located, including those created by prior owners or occupants, abutters or other persons. Various federal and state laws impose liabilities upon property owners and operators, including us, for environmental damages arising at, or migrating from, owned or operated properties, and we cannot be sure that we will not be held liable for the costs of environmental investigation and clean up at, or near, our owned or operated properties. As an owner or operator or previous owner or operator of properties, we also may be liable to pay damages to government agencies or third parties for costs and damages they incur arising from environmental hazards at, or migrating from, our owned or operated properties. In addition, under our leases with SNH, we have agreed to indemnify SNH for any such liabilities related to the properties on which our senior living communities that we lease from SNH are located. The costs and damages that may arise from environmental hazards are often difficult to project and may be substantial.\nWe believe some of our senior living communities may contain asbestos. We believe any asbestos at our senior living communities is contained in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and we have no current plans to remove it. If we removed the asbestos or demolished the affected senior living communities, certain environmental regulations govern the manner in which the asbestos must be handled and removed, and we could incur substantial costs complying with such regulations.\nSome observers believe severe weather activities in different parts of the country over the last few years are evidence of global climate change. Such severe weather may have an adverse effect on the senior living communities we operate. Further, the political debate about climate change has resulted in various treaties, laws and regulations that are intended to limit carbon emissions. These or future laws may cause costs at our senior living communities to increase. In the long term, we believe any such increased costs will be passed through and paid by our residents and other customers in higher charges for our services. Laws enacted to mitigate climate change may make some of our buildings obsolete or require us to make material investments in our senior living communities which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For more information regarding climate change matters and their possible adverse impact on us, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Impact of Climate Change\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur former rehabilitation hospitals may be subject to retroactive Medicare reclassifications or repayments.\nDuring the period we operated our rehabilitation hospitals, which were sold in the fourth quarter of 2013, Medicare payments accounted for a significant amount of the rehabilitation hospitals\u2019 revenues. CMS has established a standard known as the \u201c60% Rule\u201d, which provides that at least 60% of an inpatient rehabilitation facility\u2019s, or IRF\u2019s, total inpatient population must require intensive rehabilitation services associated with treatment of at least one of thirteen designated medical conditions in order for the facility to be classified as an IRF by the Medicare program. Although we believe that our IRFs were operated in\ncompliance with the 60% Rule during the period in which we operated them, CMS could determine that we were non-compliant in a prior year. Such an event would result in these rehabilitation hospitals being subject to Medicare reclassification to a different type of provider and our receiving lower Medicare payment rates retroactively. Also, retroactive audits of Medicare claims submitted by IRFs and other providers are expanding, and CMS is recouping amounts paid for services determined by auditors not to have been medically necessary or not to meet Medicare criteria for coverage as billed. If our IRFs were required to make substantial retroactive repayments to Medicare, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nChanges in lease accounting standards may materially and adversely affect us.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, adopted new accounting rules to be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 which generally will require companies to capitalize long term leases on their balance sheets by recognizing lessees\u2019 rights and obligations. When the rules are effective, we will be required to account for the leases for our senior living communities, including those with SNH, in the assets and liabilities on our balance sheet, where previously we accounted for such leases on an \u201coff balance sheet\u201d basis. As a result, a significant amount of lease related assets and liabilities will be recorded on our balance sheet and we may be required to make other changes to the recording and classification of our lease related expenses. Though these changes will not have any direct impact on our overall financial condition, these changes could cause investors or others to believe that we are highly leveraged and could change the calculations of financial metrics and covenants, as well as third party financial models regarding our financial condition.\nRISKS ARISING FROM CERTAIN OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS AND OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE\nOur agreements and relationships with SNH, one of our Managing Directors, RMR LLC and others related to them may create conflicts of interest or the appearance of such conflicts.\nWe have significant commercial and other relationships with SNH, one of our Managing Directors, Barry Portnoy, RMR LLC and others related to them, including:\n\u2022\nSNH owns 8.5% of our outstanding common shares as of December 31, 2016;\n\u2022\nThe substantial majority of the senior living communities that we operate are owned by SNH;\n\u2022\nOne of our Managing Directors, Barry Portnoy, and his son, Adam Portnoy, are managing trustees of SNH and they own, directly or indirectly, in aggregate 1.3% of SNH\u2019s outstanding common shares as of December 31, 2016;\n\u2022\nRMR LLC provides management services to us and SNH and we pay RMR fees for those services based on a percentage of revenues, as defined under our business management agreement with RMR LLC. In the event of a conflict between us and SNH or us and RMR LLC, any of its affiliates or any public entity RMR LLC provides management services to, RMR LLC may act on its own and SNH\u2019s or such other entity\u2019s behalf rather than on our behalf;\n\u2022\nAdam Portnoy and Barry Portnoy are the controlling shareholders, managing directors, officers and employees of The RMR Group Inc., or RMR Inc., and they are officers of, and own equity interests in, RMR LLC. RMR Inc. is the managing member of RMR LLC and RMR LLC is a subsidiary of RMR Inc.;\n\u2022\nAdam Portnoy and Barry Portnoy are our largest stockholders, and they own, directly or indirectly, in aggregate 36.7% of our outstanding common shares as of December 31, 2016;\n\u2022\nOur President and Chief Executive Officer, Bruce J. Mackey Jr., our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Richard A. Doyle, and our Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Katherine E. Potter, are also officers and employees of RMR LLC, as are SNH\u2019s president and chief operating officer and chief financial officer and treasurer;\n\u2022\nPrior to December 31, 2001, we were a wholly owned subsidiary of SNH. On that date, SNH distributed substantially all of our then outstanding common shares it owned to its shareholders. In connection with that distribution, we entered into agreements with SNH and RMR LLC which, among other things, limit (subject to certain exceptions) ownership of more than 9.8% of our voting shares, restrict our ability to take any action that\ncould jeopardize the tax status of SNH as a real estate investment trust and limit our ability to acquire real estate of types which are owned by SNH or other businesses managed by RMR LLC;\n\u2022\nWe lease our office headquarters building from a subsidiary of ABP Trust. ABP Trust is owned by Adam Portnoy and Barry Portnoy and they serve as its trustees and Adam Portnoy serves as its president;\n\u2022\nIn order to accommodate healthcare licensing requirements, we manage a portion of a senior living community that SNH owns and which SNH leases to D&R Yonkers LLC. D&R Yonkers LLC is owned by SNH\u2019s president and chief operating officer and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer;\n\u2022\nWe, SNH, ABP Trust and four other companies to which RMR LLC provides management services currently own AIC, are parties to an amended and restated shareholders agreement regarding AIC and participate in AIC\u2019s property insurance program.\nThese relationships could create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving us, SNH, one of our Managing Directors, RMR LLC and others related to them. As a result of these relationships, our leases and management and pooling agreements with SNH, business management agreement with RMR LLC and other transactions with SNH, our Managing Director, RMR LLC and others related to them were not negotiated on an arm\u2019s length basis between unrelated third parties, and therefore the terms thereof may not be as favorable to us as they would have been if they were negotiated on an arm\u2019s length basis between unrelated third parties. In the past, in particular following periods of volatility in the overall market or declines in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholder litigation, dissident stockholder director nominations and dissident stockholder proposals have often been instituted against companies alleging conflicts of interest in business dealings with affiliated and related persons and entities. These activities, if instituted against us, and the existence of conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business and the market price of our common shares.\nAdam Portnoy and Barry Portnoy own in aggregate 36.7% of our outstanding common shares. As a result, investors in our securities may have less influence over our business than shareholders of other publicly owned companies.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Adam Portnoy and Barry Portnoy owned, directly or indirectly, in aggregate 36.7% of our outstanding common shares.\nFor so long as Adam Portnoy and Barry Portnoy and entities owned by them continue to retain a significant ownership stake in us, they may have significant influence in the election of the members of our Board of Directors, including our Independent Directors, and the outcome of stockholder actions. As a result, they may have the ability to significantly impact all matters affecting us, including:\n\u2022\nthe composition of our Board of Directors and, through our Board of Directors, determinations with respect to our management, business, investment, disposition and financing plans and policies, including the appointment and removal of our officers;\n\u2022\ndeterminations with respect to mergers and other business combinations;\n\u2022\nour acquisition or disposition of assets;\n\u2022\nour financing activities;\n\u2022\nour capital structure; and\n\u2022\nthe number of common shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plan.\nIn addition, the significant ownership of Adam Portnoy, Barry Portnoy, entities owned by them and SNH in us may discourage transactions involving a change of control of us, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their common shares over the then current market price.\nAs a result of the large ownership positions of Adam Portnoy, Barry Portnoy and SNH, trading in our common shares may be more difficult.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Adam Portnoy and Barry Portnoy owned, directly or indirectly, in aggregate 36.7% of our outstanding common shares and SNH owned 8.5% of our outstanding common shares. These large shareholdings, some of which are subject to lock-up restrictions, reduce the number of our common shares that might otherwise be available to trade publicly, which could adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our common shares.\nOur leases of certain of our senior living communities are subordinated to mortgage debt of SNH, and a default by SNH could result in the termination of those leases.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our leases with SNH for 17 of our senior living communities, which had aggregate 2016 revenues of $159.4 million were subordinated to mortgage financing secured by such communities. As a result, in the event SNH was to default on such mortgage financing, by reason of our default under our leases or for reasons unrelated to us or beyond our control, and its lender were to foreclose on those properties, our leases would terminate. While we may be able to enter into new leases with the lenders or the purchaser or purchasers of such properties, or they may elect to continue our occupancy under the terms of the lease as if there had been no foreclosure, they would not be obligated to pursue either of those options and, if we are able to retain possession, the terms of our continued occupancy may not be as favorable to us as those contained in our leases with SNH. If we do not enter into new leases of such communities following a foreclosure, we would lose the right to continue to operate these communities and we may incur material obligations to residents, employees and other parties as a result of such loss.\nOwnership limitations and certain provisions in our charter, bylaws and certain material agreements, as well as certain provisions of Maryland law, may deter, delay or prevent a change in our control or unsolicited acquisition proposals.\nOur charter and bylaws contain separate provisions which prohibit any stockholder from owning more than 9.8% and 5% of the number or value of any class or series of our outstanding shares of stock. The 9.8% ownership limitation in our charter is consistent with our contractual obligation with SNH to not take actions that may conflict with SNH\u2019s status as a real estate investment trust under the IRC. The 5% ownership limitation in our bylaws, or our NOL bylaw, is intended to help us preserve the tax treatment of our NOLs and other tax benefits. We also believe these provisions promote good orderly governance. These provisions inhibit acquisitions of a significant stake in us and may deter, delay or prevent a change in control of us or unsolicited acquisition proposals that a stockholder may consider favorable.\nOn October 2, 2016, our Board of Directors granted a conditional exception from certain ownership limitations under our organizational documents, SNH granted certain consents and waivers under its leases, management or other agreements with us and our lenders granted certain consents and waivers under the agreement governing our prior credit facility that would allow Adam Portnoy, Barry Portnoy and certain of their related persons to acquire, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions, in aggregate up to 38% of our issued and outstanding common shares, subject to certain limitations. On November 10, 2016, ABP Acquisition LLC, a company owned indirectly by Adam Portnoy and Barry Portnoy, completed the acquisition of 17,999,999 of our common shares at a purchase price of $3.00 per share pursuant to a tender offer. The acquisition of 18,000,000 common shares was the maximum acquisition that our Board of Directors was prepared to approve for purposes of our NOL bylaw. Based on our Board of Directors\u2019 desire to continue to preserve the tax treatment of our NOLs and other tax benefits, ABP Acquisition LLC\u2019s acquisition of 17,999,999 common shares will reduce the size of any future acquisition that our Board of Directors may be prepared to approve for purposes of our NOL bylaw.\nOther provisions contained in our charter and bylaws or under Maryland law may also inhibit acquisitions of a significant stake in us and deter, delay or prevent a change in control of us or unsolicited acquisition proposals that a stockholder may consider favorable, including, for example, provisions relating to:\n\u2022\nthe division of our Directors into three classes, with the term of one class expiring each year, which could delay a change of control;\n\u2022\nstockholder voting rights and standards for the election of Directors and other provisions which require larger majorities for approval of actions which are not approved by our Directors than for actions which are approved by our Directors;\n\u2022\nthe authority of our Board of Directors, and not our stockholders, to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws and to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nrequired qualifications for an individual to serve as a Director and a requirement that certain of our Directors be \u201cIndependent Directors\u201d and other Directors be \u201cManaging Directors\u201d, as defined in our bylaws;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to propose nominees for election as Directors and propose other business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to remove our Directors; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of our Board of Directors to create and issue new classes or series of stock (including stock with voting rights and other rights and privileges that may deter a change in control) and issue additional common shares.\nIn addition, our shareholders agreement with respect to AIC provides that AIC and the other shareholders of AIC may have rights to acquire our interests in AIC in the event that anyone acquires more than 9.8% of our shares or we experience some other change in control. The terms of our leases and management agreements with SNH provide that our rights under these agreements may be cancelled by SNH upon the acquisition by any person or group of more than 9.8% of our voting stock, and upon other change in control events, as defined in those documents including, in certain of the leases and management agreements, the adoption of any proposal (other than a precatory proposal) or the election to our Board of Directors of any individual if such proposal or individual was not approved, nominated or appointed, as the case may be, by vote of a majority of our Directors in office immediately prior to the making of such proposal or the nomination or appointment of such individual. In addition, a change in control event of us, including upon the acquisition by any person or group of more than 35% of our voting stock, is a default under our credit agreement, unless approved by our lenders.\nOur ownership interest in AIC may prevent stockholders from accumulating a large stake in us, from nominating or serving as Directors, or from taking actions to otherwise control our business.\nAs an owner of AIC, we are licensed and approved as an insurance holding company; and any stockholder who owns or controls 10% or more of our securities or anyone who wishes to solicit proxies for election of, or to serve as, one of our Directors or for another proposal of business not approved by our Board of Directors may be required to receive pre-clearance from the concerned insurance regulators. These pre-approval procedures may discourage or prevent investors from purchasing our securities, from nominating persons to serve as our Directors or from taking other actions.\nOur rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our Directors and officers are limited.\nOur charter limits the liability of our Directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law. Under current Maryland law, our Directors and officers will not have any liability to us and our stockholders for money damages other than liability resulting from:\n\u2022\nactual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or\n\u2022\nactive and deliberate dishonesty by such Director or officer that was established by a final judgment as being material to the cause of action adjudicated.\nOur charter and contractual obligations authorize and may require us to indemnify our present and former Directors and officers for actions taken by them in those and other capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. In addition, we may be obligated to pay or reimburse the expenses incurred by our present and former Directors and officers without requiring a preliminary determination of their ultimate entitlement to indemnification. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our present and former Directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent the provisions in our charter and contracts or that might exist with other companies, which could limit our stockholders recourse in the event of actions not in their best interest.\nDisputes with SNH and RMR LLC and stockholder litigation against us or our Directors and officers may be referred to binding arbitration proceedings.\nOur contracts with SNH and RMR LLC provide that any dispute arising under those contracts may be referred to binding arbitration proceedings. Similarly, our bylaws provide that certain actions by our stockholders against us or against our Directors and officers, other than disputes, or any portion thereof, regarding the meaning, interpretation or validity of any provision of our charter or bylaws, may be referred to binding arbitration proceedings. As a result, we and our stockholders would not be able to pursue litigation in courts against SNH, RMR LLC or our Directors and officers for disputes referred to\narbitration in accordance with our bylaws. In addition, the ability to collect attorneys\u2019 fees or other damages may be limited in the arbitration proceedings, which may discourage attorneys from agreeing to represent parties wishing to commence such a proceeding.\nOur bylaws designate the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland as the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our Directors, officers, manager, agents or employees.\nOur bylaws currently provide that, unless the dispute has been referred to binding arbitration, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland will be the sole and exclusive forum for: (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (2) any action asserting a claim for breach of a duty owed by any Director, officer, manager, agent or employee of ours to us or our stockholders; (3) any action asserting a claim against us or any Director, officer, manager, agent or employee of ours arising pursuant to Maryland law, our charter or bylaws brought by or on behalf of a stockholder; or (4) any action asserting a claim against us or any Director, officer, manager, agent or employee of ours that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our bylaws currently also provide that the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland will be the sole and exclusive forum for any dispute, or portion thereof, regarding the meaning, interpretation or validity of any provision of our charter or bylaws. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in our common shares shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions of our bylaws, as they may be amended from time to time. These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the stockholder believes is favorable for disputes with us or our Directors, officers, manager, agents or employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our Directors, officers, manager or agents.\nWe may experience losses from our business dealings with AIC.\nWe, SNH, ABP Trust and four other companies to which RMR LLC provides management services each own 14.3% of AIC, and we have invested $6.0 million in AIC. We and those other AIC shareholders participate in a combined property insurance program arranged and reinsured in part by AIC and we periodically consider the possibilities for expanding our relationship with AIC to other types of insurance. Our principal reason for investing in AIC and for purchasing insurance in these programs is to seek to improve our financial results by obtaining improved insurance coverage at lower costs than may be otherwise available to us or by participating in any profits which we may realize as an owner of AIC. While we believe we have in the past benefitted from these arrangements, these beneficial financial results may not occur in the future, and we may need to invest additional capital in order to continue to pursue these results. AIC\u2019s business involves the risks typical of an insurance business, including the risk that it may not operate profitably. Accordingly, financial benefits from our business dealings with AIC may not be achieved in the future, and we may experience losses from these dealings.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common shares, and we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nChanges in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\nAs with other publicly traded equity securities, the market price of our common shares depends on various market conditions and other factors that may change from time to time, including:\n\u2022\nthe liquidity of the market for our common shares;\n\u2022\nchanges in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022\nthe extent of investor interest in our common shares;\n\u2022\nmarket interest rates;\n\u2022\nnational economic conditions; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced broad price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also cause the market price of our common shares to decline. Stockholders may be unable to resell our common shares at or above the price at which they purchased our common shares.", "PERMNO": 89252, "SIC": 8051, "TIC": "FVE"}
