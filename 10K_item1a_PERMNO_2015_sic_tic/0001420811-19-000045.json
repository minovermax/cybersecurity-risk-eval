{"cik": "1420811", "company": "On Deck Capital, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nOur current and prospective investors should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d before making investment decisions regarding our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face, but include the most significant factors currently known by us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. In that case, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nWe have a history of losses prior to 2018 and may not achieve consistent profitability in the future.\nWhile we generated net income in 2018 of $25.3 million, we generated net losses of $14.3 million and $85.5 million 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $195.2 million. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels, and control costs and credit losses, in future periods in order to maintain or increase our level of profitability. We intend to continue to expend significant funds on our marketing and sales operations, increasing our investment in technology and analytics capabilities including investments in our wholly-owned ODX subsidiary, increasing our customer service and general loan servicing capabilities, meeting the increased compliance requirements associated with our operation as a public company that will cease to qualify as an \"emerging growth company\" after 2019 and changing regulatory requirements, and upgrading our technology infrastructure and expanding in existing or possibly new markets. In addition, we record our loan loss provision as an expense to account for the possibility that loans we intend to hold may not be repaid in full. Because we incur a given loan loss expense at the time that we issue the loans we intend to hold, we expect the aggregate amount of this expense to grow as we increase the total amount of loans we make to our customers.\nOur efforts to grow our business may be more costly than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our higher operating expenses. Future profitability may decline or be volatile, and we may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this report, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays, and other unknown events. If profitability declines or is volatile, or we are unable to sustain profitability, the market price of our common stock may significantly decrease.\nOur recent growth may not be indicative of our future growth and, if we continue to grow, we may not be able to manage our growth effectively.\nOur gross revenue grew to $398.4 million in 2018 from $351.0 million in 2017 and from $291.3 million in 2016. We expect that, in the future, even if our revenue continues to increase, our rate of revenue growth may decline.\nIn addition, we expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:\n\u2022\nmarketing, including expenses relating to increased direct marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nexpanding product offerings;\n\u2022\nproduct development, including the continued development of our platform and OnDeck Score;\n\u2022\ntechnology and analytics, including through ODX;\n\u2022\ndiversification of funding sources;\n\u2022\nbroadening distribution capabilities through strategic partnerships and funding advisors;\n\u2022\ngeneral administration, including legal, accounting and other compliance expenses related to being a public company and the loss of emerging growth company status at the end of 2019; and\n\u2022\nexpansion in Canada and Australia, and possibly into new international geographies.\nIn addition, our historical growth has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources. Finally, as our business grows, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures. If we cannot manage our growth effectively, our financial results will suffer.\nOur current level of interest rate spread may decline in the future. Any material reduction in our interest rate spread could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe earn a majority of our revenues from interest payments on the loans we make to our customers. Financial institutions and other funding sources provide us with the funding for these term loans and lines of credit and charge us interest on the funds that we utilize. In the event that the spread between the interest rate at which we lend to our customers and the interest rate at which we borrow from our lenders decreases, our financial results and operating performance will be harmed. The interest rates we charge to our customers and pay to our lenders could each be affected by a variety of factors, including access to capital based on our business performance, the volume of loans we make to our customers, competition and regulatory requirements. These interest rates may also be affected by a change over time in the mix of the types of loans we provide to our customers and sell to our investors, the mix of new and renewal loans and a shift among our channels of customer acquisition.\nOur funding mix and loan structure increase the risk that out interest rate spread will decline in periods of rising interest rates. We lend to our customers at a fixed rate of interest while a majority of our borrowings that fund our lending are at a variable rate of interest. To the extent that underlying market interest rates rise, our interest rate spread will likely narrow. We may not be able to successfully mitigate this risk either partially or at all. Any interest rate hedging we enter into may not be effective and we may not be able to successfully raise the interest rates we charge customers on new originations due to competitive and other factors.\nInterest rate changes may adversely affect our business forecasts and expectations and are highly sensitive to many macroeconomic factors beyond our control, such as inflation, recession, the state of the credit markets, changes in market interest rates, global economic disruptions, unemployment and the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. Any material reduction in our interest rate spread could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWorsening economic conditions may result in decreased demand for our loans, cause our customers\u2019 default rates to increase and harm our operating results.\nUncertainty and negative trends in general economic conditions in the United States and abroad, including significant tightening of credit markets, historically have created a difficult environment for companies in the lending industry. Many factors, including factors that are beyond our control, may have a detrimental impact on our operating performance. These factors include general economic conditions, unemployment levels, energy costs and interest rates, as well as events such as natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism and catastrophes.\nOur customers are small businesses and some customers have a limited operating history. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 24.4% of our total loans outstanding related to customers with fewer than five years of operating history. Accordingly, our customers historically have been, and may in the future remain, more likely to be affected or more severely affected than large enterprises by adverse economic conditions. These conditions may result in a decline in the demand for our loans by potential and existing customers, and higher default rates by existing customers. If a customer defaults on a loan payable to us, the loan enters a collections process where our systems and collections teams initiate contact with the customer for payments owed. In the past when we charged off a loan, we had generally sold the loan to a third-party collection agency in exchange for only a small fraction of the remaining amount payable to us. In 2018, we began expanding our in-house collection efforts up to and including litigation with the goal of achieving higher net recoveries over time. We expect to continue this strategy. At year-end 2018, we retained all or substantially all of our delinquent loans, which contributed to an increase in our Reserve Ratio and 15+ Day Delinquency Ratio. There is no assurance that this strategy will be successful, and it could result in lower recoveries than we have realized historically from selling charged-off loans. It may also lead to increased litigation, negative publicity and harm to our reputation.\nThere can be no assurance that economic conditions will remain favorable for our business or that demand for our loans or default rates by our customers will remain at current levels. Reduced demand for our loans would negatively impact our growth and revenue, while increased default rates by our customers may inhibit our access to capital, including debt warehouse facilities and securitizations, and negatively impact our profitability. Furthermore, we have received a large number of applications from potential customers who do not satisfy the requirements for an OnDeck loan. If an insufficient number of qualified small businesses apply for our loans, our growth and revenue could decline.\nAn increase in customer default rates may reduce our overall profitability and could also affect our ability to attract institutional funding. Further, historical default rates may not be indicative of future results.\nCustomer default rates may be significantly affected by economic downturns or general economic conditions beyond our control and beyond the control of individual customers. In particular, loss rates on customer loans may increase due to factors such as prevailing interest rates, the rate of unemployment, the level of consumer and business confidence, commercial real estate values, the value of the U.S. dollar, energy prices, changes in consumer and business spending, the number of personal and business\nbankruptcies, disruptions in the credit markets and other factors. We offer both our term loan and line of credit loans to the same customers, subject to customary credit and loan underwriting procedures. To the extent that our customers borrow from us under both types of loans and default, our losses could be greater than if we had offered them only one type of loan. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, approximately 24.4% of our total loans outstanding related to customers with fewer than five years of operating history. While our loan decisioning process is designed to establish that, notwithstanding such limited operating and financial history, customers would be a reasonable credit risk, our loans may nevertheless be expected to have a higher default rate than loans made to customers with more established operating and financial histories. In addition, if default rates, delinquency rates or certain performance metrics reach certain levels, the principal of our securitized notes or other borrowings may be required to be paid down, and we may no longer be able to borrow from our debt facilities to fund future loans.\nEven in favorable economic conditions, supply and demand driven changes in credit can place downward pressure on our loan pricing, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe believe that favorable economic conditions are generally helpful to OnDeck\u2019s business because historically small business and consumer optimism tends to encourage investments in small businesses and to promote related borrowing activity. However, these conditions can also tend to expand risk levels acceptable to legacy financial institutions and to increase capital availability for newer FinTech competitors. These forces, combined with the lower switching costs that online platforms provide, could place downward pressure or create volatility on our loan pricing, reducing our ability to generate growth from current and prospective price-sensitive customers. This could be particularly damaging to us because of our size relative to larger small business lenders. We may not be able to adequately reduce our marginal costs if our loan pricing were to decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe operate in a cyclical industry. In an economic downturn, we may not be able to grow our business or maintain levels of liquidity, loss, and revenue growth to sustain our business and remain viable through the credit cycle.\nThe timing, severity, and duration of an economic downturn have can have significant negative impacts on small businesses and our ability to generate adequate revenue and to absorb expected and unexpected losses.\nWe do not have all of the elements necessary to ensure sustainability of our business in all circumstances. In making a decision whether to extend credit to a new or existing customer, or determine appropriate pricing for a loan, our decision structure relies on robust data collection, our proprietary credit scoring model, market expertise and judgmental underwriting. An economic downturn will place financial stress on our customers, potentially impacting our decision structure\u2019s ability to make accurate decisions. Small businesses are typically impacted before and more severely than large businesses. Our early warning and portfolio management capabilities\u2019 ability to adapt in a manner that balances future revenue production and loss minimization will be tested in a downturn. The longevity and severity of a downturn will also place pressure on our lenders, who provide financing to us through our debt warehouses and our securitization. There can be no assurance that our financing arrangements will remain available to us through any particular business cycle. The timing and extent of a downturn may also require us to change, postpone or cancel our strategic initiatives or growth plans to pursue shorter-term sustainability. The longer and more severe an economic downturn, the greater the adverse impact on us, which could be material.\nWe rely on our proprietary decision structure to make credit decisions, set loan prices and forecast loss rates. If we do not make accurate credit and pricing decisions or effectively forecast our loss rates, our business and financial results will be harmed, and the harm could be material.\nIn making a decision whether to extend credit to prospective customers, we rely upon data to assess credit handling ability, debt servicing capacity, and overall risk level to determine lending exposure and loan pricing. If the components or analytics are either unstable, biased, or missing key pieces of information, the wrong decisions will be made which will negatively affect our financial results. If our proprietary decision structure fails to adequately predict the creditworthiness of our customers, including a failure to predict a customer\u2019s true credit risk profile and/or ability to repay their loan, we have in the past recorded, and may in the future need to record, additional provision expense and/or experience higher than forecasted losses. Additionally, if any portion of the information pertaining to the prospective customer is false, inaccurate or incomplete, and our systems did not detect such falsities, inaccuracies or incompleteness, or any or all of the other components of our credit decision process fails, we may experience higher than forecasted losses. Furthermore, if we are unable to access the third-party data used in our decision structure, or our access to such data is limited, our ability to accurately evaluate potential customers will be compromised, and we may be unable to effectively predict probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would negatively impact our results of operations, which could be material.\nAdditionally, if we make errors in the development and validation of any of the underwriting models or tools that we use for the loans securing our debt warehouses or our securitization, such loans may experience higher delinquencies and losses, which could result in the principal of our securitized notes or other borrowings being required to be paid down, and we may no longer\nbe able to borrow from those debt facilities to fund future loans. Moreover, if future performance of our customers\u2019 loans differs from past experience (driven by factors, including but not limited to, macroeconomic factors, policy actions by regulators, lending by other institutions and reliability of data used in the underwriting process), which experience has informed the development of the underwriting procedures employed by us, delinquency rates and losses to investors of our securitized debt from our customers\u2019 loans could increase, which could result in the principal of our securitized notes or other borrowings being required to paid down, and we may no longer be able to borrow from those debt facilities to fund future loans. This inability to borrow from our debt facilities, which could further hinder our growth and harm our financial performance.\nOur allowance for loan losses is determined based upon both objective and subjective factors and may not be adequate to absorb loan losses.\nWe face the risk that our customers will fail to repay their loans in full. We reserve for such losses by establishing an allowance for loan losses, the increase of which results in a reduction of our earnings as we recognize a provision expense for loan losses. We have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. While this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the forecasts and establishment of loan losses are also dependent on our subjective assessment based upon our experience and judgment. Actual losses are difficult to forecast, especially if such losses stem from factors beyond our experience, and unlike traditional banks, we are not subject to periodic review by bank regulatory agencies of our allowance for loan losses. In addition, for our line of credit product we estimate probable losses on unfunded loan commitments in a process similar to that used for the allowance for loan losses.\nAs a result, there can be no assurance that our allowance for loan losses or expense accrual for probable losses on unfunded line of credit commitments will be comparable to that of traditional banks subject to regulatory oversight or sufficient to absorb losses or prevent a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the information provided by customers to us is incorrect or fraudulent, we may misjudge a customer\u2019s qualification to receive a loan and our operating results may be harmed.\nOur lending decisions are based partly on information provided to us by loan applicants. To the extent that these applicants provide information to us in a manner that we are unable to verify, our loan decisioning process, including the OnDeck Score, may not accurately reflect the associated risk. In addition, data provided by third-party sources is a significant component of our loan decisioning and this data may contain inaccuracies. Inaccurate analysis of credit data that could result from false loan application information could harm our reputation, business and operating results.\nIn addition, we use identity and fraud checks analyzing data provided by external databases to authenticate each customer\u2019s identity. From time to time in the past, these checks have failed and there is a risk that these checks could also fail in the future, and fraud, which may be significant, may occur. We may not be able to recoup funds underlying loans made in connection with inaccurate statements, omissions of fact or fraud, in which case our revenue, operating results and profitability will be harmed. Fraudulent activity or significant increases in fraudulent activity could also lead to regulatory intervention, negatively impact our operating results, brand and reputation, and require us to take steps to reduce fraud risk, which could increase our costs.\nOur enterprise risk management efforts may misalign with our strategic objectives, which can result in us failing to achieve our objectives.\nWe are exposed to credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks related to our business, assets and liabilities. To manage these risks, we have developed enterprise risk management capabilities with the goal of supporting our growth objectives, client reach, risk targets and operational complexities while balancing the needs of stockholders, customers and employees. In order to be effective, among other things, our enterprise risk management capabilities must adapt and align to support any new product or loan features, capability, strategic development, or external change. We could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted to the extent our business model, operational processes, control functions, technological capabilities, risk analyses, and business/product knowledge do not adequately identify and manage potential risks associated with our strategic initiatives.\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry that may not develop as expected. Assessing our business and future prospects is challenging in light of the risks and difficulties we may encounter. These risks and difficulties include our ability to:\n\u2022\nincrease the number and total volume of term loans and lines of credit we extend to our customers;\n\u2022\nimprove the terms on which we lend to our customers as our business becomes more efficient;\n\u2022\nincrease the effectiveness of our direct marketing, as well as our strategic partner and funding advisor program customer acquisition channels;\n\u2022\nmaintain or increase repeat borrowing by existing customers;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully develop and deploy new types of loans and new loan features including equipment finance loans;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully expand ODX, our comprehensive technology and services platform that facilitates online lending to small business customers, to additional banks and other small business lenders;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully maintain our diversified funding strategy, including through debt warehouse facilities and possible future securitization transactions;\n\u2022\nfavorably compete with other companies that are currently in, or may in the future enter, the business of lending to small businesses including traditional lenders and so-called \"closed-loop lenders;\"\n\u2022\nsuccessfully navigate economic conditions and fluctuations in the credit market;\n\u2022\neffectively manage the growth of our business;\n\u2022\nobtain debt or equity capital on attractive terms;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully expand internationally; and\n\u2022\nanticipate and react to changes in an evolving regulatory environment.\nWe may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties, which could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer.\nTo date, we have derived our revenue from a limited number of financing options and markets. Our efforts to expand our market reach and financing options may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth.\nWe offer term loans and lines of credit to our customers in the United States and Canada and term loans to our customers in Australia. Many of our competitors offer a more diverse set of financing options to small businesses and in additional international markets. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in broadening the scope of financing options that we offer to our customers. Failure to broaden the scope of financing options we offer to potential customers may inhibit the growth of repeat business from our customers and harm our operating results. There also can be no guarantee that we will be successful with respect to our current efforts in Canada and Australia, as well as any further expansion beyond the United States, Canada and Australia, if we decide to attempt such expansion at all, which may also inhibit the growth of our business.\nDemand for our loans may decline if we do not continue to innovate or respond to evolving technological changes.\nWe operate in a nascent industry characterized by rapidly evolving technology and frequent product introductions. We rely on our proprietary technology to make our platform available to customers, determine the creditworthiness of loan applicants, and service the loans we make to customers. In addition, we may increasingly rely on technological innovation as we introduce new types of loans, expand our current loans into new markets, and continue to streamline the lending process. The process of developing new technologies and products is complex, and if we are unable to successfully innovate and continue to deliver a superior customer experience, customers\u2019 demand for our loans may decrease and our growth and operations may be harmed.\nCustomer complaints or negative publicity could result in a decline in our customer growth and our business could suffer.\nOur reputation is very important to attracting new customers to our platform as well as securing repeat lending to existing customers. There can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain a good relationship with our customers or avoid negative publicity. Any damage to our reputation, whether arising from our conduct of business, negative publicity, regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions, matters affecting our financial reporting or compliance with SEC and New York Stock Exchange listing requirements, security breaches or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure of operating controls could produce a significant negative outcome, including customer experience degradation, legal expenses, increased regulatory cost, significant internal and external fraud losses and vendor risk.\nWe are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, anti-money laundering rules and rules relating to unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, as well as regulations of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Losses from operational failures can be\nmaterial. These losses can arise from a wide range of breaches in controls, procedures, processes and security. Breaches in any of these controls, procedures, processes or security measures could lead to significant legal expense and, even, punitive damages. Internal fraud, including the stealing and dissemination of client personally identifiable information, can create significant client distrust and result in serious legal action against us. Breaches in client onboarding and servicing processes can degrade customer experience and place current and future revenues at risk. The continued proliferation and technological advances in first and third-party fraud can result in large losses over a short period of time if undetected. While we seek to enhance and develop our operational risk strategy and control structure, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful and that we will avoid material operational losses. These potential operational risk loss scenarios are not exhaustive and we could experience a significant loss in any scenario if our operational risk enhancements do not keep pace with our business, capabilities or our continued organizational growth and complexity. In addition, operational failures could have a significant effect on our reputation which could cause additional material harm to our business and prospects.\nOur strategy to expand the availability of our platform to other lenders through our wholly-owned subsidiary, ODX, relies on an unproven business model in an emerging industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate the prospects for that strategy and the risks and challenges we may encounter.\nPart of our growth strategy is to expand the availability of our platform to other lenders through our wholly-owned subsidiary, ODX. This strategy relies on an unproven business model in an emerging industry. As a result, the revenue and income potential of offering our platform through ODX and the related market opportunity are uncertain. In order to pursue this strategy we will be required to make significant investments over time, attract new customers and retain existing ones. Future demand and market acceptance of our platform through ODX are unpredictable. The sales cycle to attract a lender to our platform is long and complex, and once a lender is attracted, the integration and ramp up can also be long, complex and expensive. As a result, it is difficult to evaluate the prospects for this strategy or the timing or degree of its potential success. It is also difficult to assess the risks and challenges we may encounter in pursuing this strategy. Many of these risks and challenges are in categories similar to those we face in our online small business lending activities as described in this Item 1A. - Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. Others may be in addition to, or greater than, those we face in our online small business lending activities. Additional or greater risks and challenges to expanding the availability of our platform to other lenders through ODX may include:\n\u2022\nlack of acceptance of our platform through ODX by other lenders;\n\u2022\nreluctance of other lenders to share their customer data with us, or impacts of data and security breaches if they do;\n\u2022\nunwillingness of other lenders to use our platform through ODX because we are doing business with their competitors, or for other reasons;\n\u2022\nthe possible preference of other lenders to build and use their own platforms, or platforms offered by existing or new competitors of ours, for online small business lending;\n\u2022\nour ability to charge fees for services commensurate with the total cost of providing those services;\n\u2022\nthe amount of time it may take us to integrate new lenders;\n\u2022\nour ability to fund investment to expand and customize our platform in advance of earning fee revenue related to that investment;\n\u2022\nour ability to provide customized solutions that meet the needs of lenders;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet the performance criteria that customers or prospective customers require;\n\u2022\nthe inability to retain one or more customers and the impact of that customer loss on other existing or prospective customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to scale our platform through ODX to make it economically viable; and\n\u2022\nour ability to compete effectively with third parties seeking to provide similar services.\nWe may not be able to successfully address these risks and challenges, which could cause our strategy to fail, harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. In addition, offering our platform through ODX, has placed, and if we are able to expand it will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources. If we cannot effectively manage the growth of this opportunity, our financial results will suffer.\nExpanding our operations internationally could subject us to new challenges and risks.\nWe currently operate in the United States, Canada and Australia and may seek to expand our business further internationally. Additional international expansion, whether in our existing or new international markets, will require additional resources and controls. Such expansion could subject our business to substantial risks including:\n\u2022\nadjusting our proprietary loan platform, and our loan decisioning process, to account for the country-specific differences in information available on potential small business borrowers;\n\u2022\nconformity with applicable business customs, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u2022\nchanges to the way we do business as compared with our current operations;\n\u2022\nthe need to support and integrate with local third-party service providers;\n\u2022\ncompetition with service providers that have greater experience in the local markets than we do or that have pre-existing relationships with potential borrowers and investors in those markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations in an environment of diverse culture, laws and customs, and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal and compliance costs associated with international operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in securing financing in international markets in local currencies;\n\u2022\ncompliance with multiple, potentially conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including banking, securities, employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with U.S. and foreign anti-bribery laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and comparable laws in Canada, Australia and other non-U.S. markets into which we might expand in the future;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting payments in foreign currencies and associated foreign currency exposure;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\ncompliance with potentially conflicting and changing laws of taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business and applicable U.S. tax laws as they relate to international operations, the complexity and adverse consequences of such tax laws and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in such tax laws; and\n\u2022\nregional economic and political conditions.\nAs a result of these risks, any potential future international expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful.\nWe may evaluate, and potentially consummate, acquisitions, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to grow our business. In some circumstances, we may determine to do so through the acquisition of complementary assets, businesses and technologies rather than through internal development. For example, in December 2018 we announced that we had entered a definitive agreement to combine our Canadian lending business with that of another Canadian company. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. We also have never made these types of acquisitions before and therefore lack experience in integrating such acquisitions, new technology and personnel. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions include:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n\u2022\ncoordination of technology, product development and sales and marketing functions;\n\u2022\ntransition of the acquired company\u2019s customers to our platform;\n\u2022\nretention of employees from the acquired company;\n\u2022\ncultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u2022\nintegration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems;\n\u2022\nthe need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\npotential write-offs of loans or intangibles or other assets acquired in such transactions that may have an adverse effect our operating results in a given period;\n\u2022\nliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business, generally. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or the write-off of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Also, the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions may not materialize.\nOur proposed entry into the equipment financing market may be unsuccessful or may not provide the expected contributions to our growth strategy. Our failure to successfully offer equipment finance loans or realize the benefits of these loans could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we began and then in mid-2018 expanded a limited pilot referral program to offer equipment finance loans to our customers. Under the pilot program, we refer customers seeking equipment financing loans to a third party that originates and services the loans. In 2019, we plan to begin making our own equipment finance loans ranging from $5,000 to $150,000, with terms ranging from 24 to 60 months. These loans will be secured by new and used equipment. We have no prior experience offering equipment finance loans which could involve significant challenges and risks including:\n\u2022\nour inability to launch and scale our equipment finance offering beyond our limited pilot program in offering equipment finance loans;\n\u2022\nour inability to effectively underwrite and price equipment finance transactions, and evaluate the initial and residual value of the loan collateral;\n\u2022\nour failure to develop or acquire the technology needed to support the offering of equipment finance loans;\n\u2022\ninadequately training sales and customer service personnel to handle the offering of equipment finance loans;\n\u2022\npossible delays in our ability to launch the offering of equipment finance loans;\n\u2022\ncustomer acceptance;\n\u2022\nintense competition from other equipment finance providers, many of whom have much more experience and greater financial resources than we do, and risks of innovation by our competitors;\n\u2022\nactual losses exceeding expected losses for the offering of equipment finance loans;\n\u2022\nworsening economic conditions that may result in decreased demand and increase our customers' default rates;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our risk management efforts; and\n\u2022\nrepossessing equipment collateral and liquidating it, including possible reputational and publicity risks associated with our collection efforts.\nAny failure on our part to successfully offer equipment finance loans or realize the expected benefits could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nThe lending industry is highly regulated. Changes in regulations or in the way regulations are applied to our business could adversely affect our business.\nOver the last few years, federal and state regulatory and other policymaking entities have taken an increased interest in marketplace and online lending, including online small business lending. Activity in various states has also increased, including in the states of California and New York. In December 2015, the California Department of Business Oversight announced an inquiry into the marketplace lending industry and requested information from fourteen marketplace and online lenders including OnDeck. In March 2018, the New York Department of Financial Services conducted its own survey of marketplace and online lending by sending a survey to numerous online lenders, including us, requesting information about their respective lending activities and business practices in the State of New York. These initiatives were presented as information gathering projects to assist federal and state officials in better understanding, among other things, the methods, role and impact of online lending on credit markets and our merchants. These initiatives either have resulted, or are expected to result, in policy recommendations that could impact our business practices and operations if the recommendations result in new laws or regulations. For example, if New York were to enact legislation requiring licensure by commercial lenders or imposing interest rate limitations or other provisions inconsistent with our current business practices and alternative solutions were not available, we could be required to change our\nbusiness practices and operations in a manner that adversely impacts our business in New York. Originations in the State of New York by us and/or our issuing bank partner made up approximately 7% of our 2018 total originations. Additionally, California recently passed legislation which requires us to provide pricing disclosures with respect to loans made by us and our issuing bank partner in California.\nWe expect these and other types of legislative and regulatory activities to continue in the future as marketplace and online lending grows and becomes the subject of greater public interest. For example, with the prospect of easing regulatory burdens at the federal level under the current administration, some states have indicated their intention to take more aggressive regulatory action. We cannot predict the outcome of these or other comparable future activities, when or whether they will lead to new laws, regulations or other actions or what they might be. However, the impact and cost of any possible future changes to laws or regulations could be substantial and could also require us to change our business practices and operations in a manner that adversely impacts our business, including by increasing compliance costs or requiring us to limit or modify our lending activities to comply. Additionally, there are a number of possible risks we face in Australia with respect to the Royal Commission's investigation into financial services. We cannot predict the outcome of the investigation, however, it is possible it could require us to change our business practices and operations in a manner that may adversely impact our business.\nChanges in laws or regulations, including recent changes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the regulatory application or judicial interpretation of the laws and regulations applicable to us could adversely affect our ability to operate in the manner in which we currently conduct business or make it more difficult or costly for us to make additional loans, or for us to collect payments on loans by subjecting us to additional licensing, registration and other regulatory requirements or restrictions in the future. For example, if our loans were determined for any reason not to be commercial loans or interest rate limitations were imposed on commercial loans, or if the validity of our relationship with an issuing bank partner were successfully challenged under a \u201ctrue lender\u201d theory or by similar arguments as made in the Madden case, we would be subject to many additional requirements, and our fees and interest arrangements could be challenged by regulators, attorneys general or our customers.\nA material failure to comply with any such laws or regulations could result in regulatory actions, lawsuits, penalties and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and our ability to originate and service loans and perform our obligations to investors and other constituents.\nA proceeding relating to one or more allegations or findings of our violation of such laws could result in modifications in our methods of doing business that could impair our ability to collect payments on our loans or to acquire additional loans or could result in the requirement that we pay damages and/or cancel the balance or other amounts owing under such loans. We cannot assure that such claims will not be asserted against us in the future. To the extent it is determined that the loans we make to our customers were not originated in accordance with all applicable laws, we could be obligated to repurchase from the entity holding the applicable loan any such loan that fails to comply with legal requirements. We may not have adequate resources to make such repurchases.\nIn addition, we do business with third parties who are not part of our funding advisor program, including third parties who may refer potential customers to us or to whom we may refer potential customers for their business. We may refer applicants who do not satisfy our credit requirements to a network of strategic partners who may offer commercial financing opportunities to those applicants. In general, if we refer an applicant that takes a loan from one of our strategic partners, that strategic partner pays us a commission based on the amount of the originated loan. Some strategic partners lend directly to such referred applicants, while other strategic partners may help the referred applicant access multiple commercial funding options on a comparison platform. The partners determine whether to extend credit to referred applicants using their own credit models and criteria.\nCertain states require a license to broker commercial loans or apply other restrictions to loan brokering activities, including applying interest rate limits to certain brokered loans. We believe that our strategic referral program would not be considered loan brokering under those state laws and, as such, would not require us to obtain a license. There is a risk that states could adopt new laws or amend or interpret existing laws to require us to obtain a broker license, impose penalties for noncompliance, or otherwise prevent us from making further referrals and collecting commissions from our referral partners. Challenges to our program could also result in costly and time-consuming litigation, damage to our reputation and harm our operating results.\nIf the choice of law provisions in our loan agreements are found to be unenforceable, we may be found to be in violation of state interest rate limit laws.\nAlthough the federal government does not currently regulate the maximum interest rates that may be charged on commercial loan transactions, many states have enacted laws specifying the maximum legal interest rate at which loans can be made in their state. We apply Virginia law to the underlying agreement for loans that we originate because our loans are underwritten and entered into in the state of Virginia, where our underwriting, risk and technology teams function.\nVirginia law does not limit interest rates on commercial loans of $5,000 or more. Assuming a court were to recognize and respect this choice of law provision for loans that we originate, Virginia law would be applied to a dispute between the customer\nand us regardless of where the customer is located. We intend for Virginia law to control over any state interest rate limit laws that would otherwise be applicable to these loans. We are not aware of any broad-based legal challenges to date to the applicability of Virginia law to the loans we originate. However, many lending laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not expressly contemplate or address the unique issues of the applicability of state laws to online transactions, including in our case, the origination of loans. In addition, laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain. As a result, we cannot predict whether a court may seek to apply a different state's law to our loans or to otherwise invalidate the applicability of Virginia law to the loans we originate.\nIf the applicability of Virginia law to these loans were challenged, and these loans were found to be governed by the laws of another state, and such other state has a law that prohibits the effective interest rate of such loans, the obligations of our customers to pay all or a portion of the interest and principal on these loans could be found unenforceable. A judgment that the choice of law provisions in our loan agreements is unenforceable also could result in costly and time-consuming litigation, penalties, damage to our reputation, trigger repurchase obligations, negatively impact the terms of our future loans and harm our operating results. Likewise, a judgment that the choice of law provision in other commercial loan agreements is unenforceable could result in challenges to our choice of law provision and that could result in costly and time-consuming litigation.\nIn February 2017, in the Madden v. Midland case described in more detail immediately below, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York held that applying the Delaware choice of law specified in the consumer loan contract at issue in the case, which would have resulted in the application of Delaware law that has no limit on allowable interest rates, would violate a fundamental public policy of New York's criminal usury statute. The court then concluded that the New York usury law, and not Delaware law, applied to the loan. That decision, or possible future decisions that similarly invalidate choice of law provisions in loan agreements, could cause us to change the way we do business in particular states and to incur substantial additional expense to comply with the laws of various states, including either licensing as a lender in the various states, altering the terms of our loans, curtailing loan originations, or requiring us to place more loans through our issuing bank partner.\nIn August 2019, the California Supreme Court held in De La Torre v. CashCall, Inc. that an interest rate on a consumer loan of $2,500 or more in California could be deemed unconscionable even though such loans are not subject to California\u2019s usury laws. Although the California Finance Code sets interest rate caps only on consumer loans less than $2,500, the California Supreme Court did not accept CashCall's position that the statute setting those rates implies that a court may never declare the interest rate on such loans to be unconscionable. While the California Supreme Court did not specifically find that CashCall\u2019s loans were unconscionable, the case was remanded back to the lower courts to make that determination.\nWhile the De La Torre decision applies only to consumer loans in the State of California, we cannot predict whether other courts might reach a similar decision regarding commercial loans. Many other states have adopted the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and have directly incorporated the UCC's unconscionability prohibition into their lending statutes. As in California, this broad unconscionability prohibition would permit a merchant in those states to argue that a high interest rate loan is invalid on the basis of unconscionability, even if those states do not otherwise impose interest rate caps on such loans. Such a decision could cause us to change the way we do business in particular states and to incur substantial additional expense to alter the terms of our loans, curtail loan originations, or require us to place more loans through our issuing bank partner.\nAs a result of court decisions in Madden v. Midland, in some circumstances, federal preemption and application of an out-of-state choice of law provision will not, or may not, be available for the benefit of certain non-bank purchasers of loans to defend against a state law claim of usury.\nOver the past few years there have been several litigation and enforcement actions aimed at issuing banks and their non-bank lending partners. These actions have primarily challenged the validity of the issuing bank partner model that is used by many non-bank lenders, including by OnDeck as described in greater detail above.\nIn May 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held in Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC that federal law did not preempt a state\u2019s interest rate limitations when applied to a non-bank debt buyer of a consumer credit card loan seeking to collect interest at the rate originally contracted for by a national bank. The Second Circuit did not decide, and remanded to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the question of whether New York law (the law of the state where the debtor lived) or Delaware law (the governing law stated in the loan agreement) governed the terms of the loan agreement. Although the Second Circuit case was appealed, in June 2016 the United States Supreme Court declined to review the case, which had the effect of leaving the decision of the Second Circuit intact.\nIn February 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on remand held that applying the Delaware choice of law specified in the loan contract, which would have resulted in the application of Delaware law that has no applicable limit on allowable interest rates, would violate a fundamental public policy of New York's criminal usury statute. The court then concluded that the New York usury law, and not Delaware law, applied to the consumer loan at issue in the case.\nThe Second Circuit\u2019s holding in the Madden case is binding on federal courts in the states included in the Second Circuit - New York, Connecticut and Vermont. If the Second Circuit's decision were extended and upheld by courts outside of the Second Circuit, it could pose a challenge to the federal preemption of state interest rate limitations for loans made by issuing bank partners in those states. Additionally, if the decision by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York applying the law of the state of the borrower (rather than the governing law stated in the loan agreement) were applied by a state or federal court outside of the Southern District of New York, then loans originated by us (or a portion of the principal and/or interest on such loans) might be unenforceable, and penalties could apply depending if the terms of such loans were deemed contrary to the law of the state of the borrower. There could be other related liabilities and reputational harm if OnDeck or a subsequent transferee of a bank-issued loan were to seek to collect on those amounts deemed to be in violation of applicable state law. In addition, the U.S. District Court in the Madden case certified a class action to pursue other remedies against the defendants in that case. It is possible that other out-of-state lenders making loans to borrowers in New York, including us, may be subject to similar claims.\nWhile the Madden decision suggests that non-bank purchasers may not be entitled to utilize federal preemption of state interest rate limitations for loans made by issuing bank partners in those states, there have also been numerous litigation and enforcement actions that challenge the status of the issuing bank partner as the \u201ctrue lender\u201d of the loan in question. These actions primarily rely on the reasoning set forth in CashCall, Inc. v. Morrisey. In that case, the court held that the non-bank consumer lending platform, CashCall, and not its bank partner, was the \u201ctrue lender\u201d for certain loans made to West Virginia residents. The court relied on a \u201cpredominate economic interest\u201d test that sought to determine which party (as between the issuing bank and the non-bank lending platform) retained the most economic risk in the loan transaction and should, therefore, be deemed the \u201ctrue lender\u201d of the loan. The CashCall decision and other similar actions challenge whether the loans should be subject to the interest rate limitations in the state where the consumer is located rather than in the bank\u2019s home state because the non-bank lending platform, and not the bank, is the \u201ctrue lender.\u201d The state law remedies with respect to the \"true lender\" actions vary depending on the jurisdiction in which the action is filed.\nThe U.S. District Court\u2019s decision in the Madden case, if extended to apply to our loans, and the various \"true lender\" actions referenced above, could limit the interest rates we can charge on certain of our loans in New York and possibly in the other states that have criminal usury caps, namely Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. In those circumstances, we may need to alter the terms of certain loans we make in those states or otherwise change the way we do business in those states, we may be subject to litigation and we may suffer an adverse impact on our business.\nIf our relationship with our issuing bank partner was to end or the legal structure supporting such relationship was to be successfully challenged, then we may have to comply with additional laws, regulations, and restrictions, and certain states may require us to obtain a lending or similar license.\nIn states that do not require a license to make commercial loans, we make term loans and extend lines of credit directly to customers pursuant to Virginia law, which is the governing law we require in the underlying loan agreements with our customers. However, some states and jurisdictions require a license to make or solicit certain commercial loans in that state or jurisdiction and/or may not honor a Virginia choice of law. These states assert either that their own licensing laws and requirements should generally apply to commercial loans made by nonbanks to residents of their state or apply to commercial loans made by nonbanks to residents of their state of certain principal amounts or with certain interest rates or other terms. In such states and jurisdictions and in some other circumstances, term loans and lines of credit are made by our issuing bank partner, which is not subject to state licensing. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, loans made by our issuing bank partner constituted 18.9%, 22.6%, and 22.2%, respectively, of the loans made during such periods. These loans are not governed by Virginia law, but rather the laws of the issuing bank partner\u2019s home state, which is Utah law in the case of our issuing bank partner, Celtic Bank. The remainder of our term loans and lines of credit provide that they are to be governed by Virginia law. Our issuing bank partner currently originates all loans in California, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota and Vermont as well as some loans in other states and jurisdictions. Although such states and jurisdictions may have licensing requirements and/or interest rate limits that purport to apply to some or all commercial loans, all such licensing requirements and/or interest rate limits that would otherwise be applicable are federally preempted when these loans are originated by a federally chartered or state chartered issuing bank partner. Loans originated by our issuing bank partner are generally priced the same as loans originated by us under Virginia law. While the other U.S. states where we originate loans currently honor our Virginia choice of law, future legal changes could result in any one or more of those states no longer honoring our Virginia choice of law. In that case, we could potentially address the legal change by altering the terms of our loans, curtailing our originations, or placing more loans through our issuing bank partner.\nIf we were otherwise not able to work with an issuing bank partner or if we were to seek to make loans directly in those states referenced above, we would have to attempt to comply with the laws of these states in other ways, including through obtaining the appropriate licenses. Compliance with the laws of such states could be costly, and if we are unable to obtain such licenses, our lending activity could substantially decrease or cease entirely and our revenues, growth and profitability would be harmed. In addition, if our activities under the current arrangement with our issuing bank partner were deemed to constitute lending or solicitation within any such jurisdiction that would require a license to engage in such activities, we could be found to have engaged\nin impermissible lending activities within such jurisdictions. As a result, we could be subjected to fines and other penalties, all or a portion of the principal and interest charged on the applicable loans could be found to be unenforceable and, to the extent it is determined that such loans were not originated in accordance with all applicable laws, we could be obligated to repurchase any loans from our debt facilities and OnDeck Marketplace participants that failed to comply with such legal requirements. Any finding that we engaged in unlicensed lending or solicitation in states for which a license was required could lead to litigation and fines, harm our reputation and negatively impact our operating results.\nSecurity breaches of customers\u2019 confidential information that we store may harm our reputation and expose us to liability.\nWe store our customers\u2019 bank information, credit information and other sensitive data. Any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access could cause the theft and criminal use of this data. Security breaches or unauthorized access to confidential information could also expose us to liability related to the loss of the information, time-consuming and expensive litigation and negative publicity. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in our software are exposed and exploited, and, as a result, a third party obtains unauthorized access to any of our customers\u2019 data, our relationships with our customers will be severely damaged, and we could incur significant liability.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we and our third-party hosting facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, many states have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach are costly to implement and often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause our customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures. Any security breach, whether actual or perceived, would harm our reputation and we could lose customers.\nThe collection, processing, use, storage, sharing and transmission of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of federal, state and international laws and regulations, as well as our failure to adhere to the privacy and data security practices that we articulate to our customers.\nWe collect, process, store, use, share and/or transmit a large volume of personally identifiable information and other sensitive data from current, past and prospective customers. There are federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and the collection, use, storage, protection, sharing and/or transmission of personally identifiable information and sensitive data. Additionally, many states continue to enact legislation on matters of privacy, information security, cybersecurity, data breach and data breach notification requirements. For example, California recently passed legislation which entitles California residents with the right to know about what personal information on them is being collected.\nAny violations of these laws and regulations may require us to change our business practices or operational structure, including limiting our activities in certain states and/or jurisdictions, address legal claims, and sustain monetary penalties, reputational damage and/or other harms to our business.\nFurthermore, our online privacy policy and website make certain statements regarding our privacy, information security, and data security practices with regard to information collected from our customers. Failure to adhere to such practices may result in regulatory scrutiny and investigation, complaints by affected customers, reputational damage and other harm to our business. If either we, or the third party service providers with which we share customer data, are unable to address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could result in additional costs and liability, damage our reputation, and harm our business.\nOur ability to collect payment on loans and maintain accurate accounts may be adversely affected by computer malware, social engineering, phishing, physical or electronic break-ins, technical errors and similar disruptions.\nThe automated nature of our platform may make it an attractive target for hacking and potentially vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. It is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, in which case there would be an increased risk of fraud or identity theft, and we may experience losses on, or delays in the collection of amounts owed on, a fraudulently induced loan. Security breaches could occur from outside our company, and also from the actions of persons inside our company who may have authorized or unauthorized access to our technology systems. In addition, the software that we have developed to use in our daily operations is highly complex and may contain undetected technical errors that could cause our computer systems to fail. Because each loan that we make involves our proprietary automated underwriting process, any failure of our computer systems involving our automated underwriting process and any technical or other errors contained in the software pertaining to our automated underwriting process could compromise our ability to accurately evaluate potential customers, which would negatively impact\nour results of operations. Furthermore, any failure of our computer systems could cause an interruption in operations and result in disruptions in, or reductions in the amount of, collections from the loans we make to our customers.\nAdditionally, if a hacker were able to access our secure files, he or she might be able to gain access to the personal information of our customers. If we are unable to prevent such activity, we may be subject to significant liability, negative publicity and a material loss of customers, all of which may negatively affect our business.\nOur business is subject to the risks of hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural disasters, power outages, telecommunications failures and similar events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism, cyberattack, and other actions. Comparable risks may also impact the demand for our loans or our customers\u2019 ability to repay their loans.\nEvents beyond our control may damage our ability to accept our customers\u2019 applications, underwrite loans, maintain our platform or perform our servicing obligations. Such events include, but are not limited to, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural disasters, power outages, telecommunications failures and similar events. Despite any precautions we may take, system interruptions and delays could occur if there is a natural disaster, if a third-party provider closes a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons, or if there are other unanticipated problems at our leased facilities. As we rely heavily on our servers, computer and communications systems and the internet to conduct our business and provide high-quality customer service, such disruptions could harm our ability to run our business and cause lengthy delays which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We currently are not able to switch instantly to our backup center in the event of failure of the main server site. This means that an outage at one facility could result in our system being unavailable for a significant period of time. Man-made problems such as terrorism, cyberattack, and other criminal, tortious or unintentional actions could also give rise to significant disruptions to our operations. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures or other disruptions. Comparable natural and man-made risks may reduce demand for our loans or cause our customers to suffer significant losses and/or incur significant disruption in their respective operations, which may affect their ability to repay their loans. All of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on data centers to deliver our services. Any disruption of service at these data centers could interrupt or delay our ability to deliver our service to our customers.\nWe currently serve our customers from two third-party data center hosting facilities in New Jersey and Colorado, as well as \"cloud\" data centers which delivers service over the internet. The continuous availability of our service depends on the operations of these facilities and cloud services, on a variety of network service providers, on third-party vendors and on data center operations staff. In addition, we depend on the ability of our third-party facility and cloud service providers to protect the facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts and similar events. If there are any lapses of service or damage to these facilities and cloud services, we could experience lengthy interruptions in our service as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging new facilities and services. Even with current and planned disaster recovery arrangements, our business could be harmed.\nWe designed our system infrastructure and procure and own or lease the computer hardware used for our services. Design and mechanical errors, failure to follow operations protocols and procedures could cause our systems to fail, resulting in interruptions in our platform. Any such interruptions or delays, whether as a result of third-party error, our own error, natural disasters or security breaches, whether accidental or willful, could harm our relationships with customers and cause our revenue to decrease and/or our expenses to increase. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. These factors in turn could further reduce our revenue and subject us to liability, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are obligated to maintain internal control over financial reporting and our management is required to report annually on the effectiveness of these internal controls. After December 2019 our independent registered public accounting firm will also be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Any determination that these internal controls are not effective may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 and as of subsequent year ends. However, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, until after we lose \u201cemerging growth company\" status effective December 31, 2019. As a result the audit of our of our financial statements as of and for the year ending December 31, 2019 will be the first time that our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement's assessment of internal control over financial reporting, and next year, the attestation of our independent registered public accounting firm, needs to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting.A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe cannot assure you that we will not in the future have material weaknesses. Because we are still an \"emerging growth company\" under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm has not formally evaluated the measures we have taken to address any deficiencies. We will cease to be an \"emerging growth company\" effective December 31, 2019. In preparation for the additional disclosure and regulatory requirements associated with our loss of \"emerging growth company\" status, we are continuing in our efforts to transition to a more developed internal control environment that incorporates increased automation, risk management procedures, and quality assurance testing. The actions we have taken and plan to take are subject to ongoing senior management review and audit committee oversight.\nWe also may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we are unable to remediate before the end of the same fiscal year in which the material weakness is identified or if we are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or beginning next year if our auditors are unable to attest to management\u2019s report on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe are also required to disclose material changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis. To comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff.\nWe will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could harm our results of operations and our ability to attract and retain qualified executives and board members.\nAs a public company we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. These expenses are increasing in preparation for when we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d effective December 31, 2019 and will continue to increase thereafter. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, we expect these rules and regulations and future regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or our board committees or as executive officers.\nIn addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In particular, we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm potentially to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404. As long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company,\" which will cease effective December 31, 2019, we may elect to avail ourselves of the exemption from the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404. However, we may no longer avail ourselves of this exemption when we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and, when our independent registered public accounting firm is required to undertake an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, the cost of our compliance with Section 404 will correspondingly increase. Our compliance with applicable provisions of Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues as we implement additional corporate governance practices and comply with reporting requirements. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 applicable to us in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nFurthermore, investor perceptions of our company may suffer if deficiencies are found, and this could cause a decline in the market price of our stock. Irrespective of compliance with Section 404, any failure of our internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our stated operating results and harm our reputation. We expect to have in place accounting, internal audit and other management systems and resources that will allow us to maintain compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act at the end of any phase-in periods permitted by the NYSE, the SEC and the JOBS Act. If we are unable to implement these changes effectively or efficiently, it could harm our operations, financial reporting or financial results and could result in an adverse opinion on internal control from our independent registered public accounting firm.\nOur business may be adversely affected by disruptions in the credit markets, our failure to comply with our debt agreements, or the termination or expiration of, or our inability to replace, our debt agreements, any of which could result in reduced access to credit and other financing. This could materially and adversely effect our business and our prospects\nHistorically, we have depended on debt facilities and other forms of debt in order to finance most of the loans we make to our customers. However, we cannot guarantee that these financing sources will continue to be available beyond the current maturity date of each debt facility, on reasonable terms or at all. As the volume of loans that we make to customers on our platform increases, we may require the expansion of our borrowing capacity of our existing debt facilities and other debt arrangements or the addition of new sources of capital. The availability of these financing sources depends on many factors, some of which are outside of our control. We may also experience the occurrence of events of default or breaches of financial performance or other covenants under our debt agreements, which could reduce or terminate our access to institutional funding.\nWe also rely on securitization as part of our funding strategy and have executed three securitization transactions, one of which, with $225 million of capacity, is currently outstanding under which cash flow can be used to purchase additional loans through March 2020. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully access the securitization markets again. In the event of a sudden or unexpected shortage of funds in the banking and financial system, we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain necessary levels of funding without incurring high funding costs, a reduction in the term of funding instruments or the liquidation of certain assets.\nFurthermore, two of our debt facilities are scheduled to mature in March 2019, representing an aggregate of $339 million of debt capacity. We may not be able to extend or renew these maturing debt facilities.\nAccordingly, if we are unable to renew or otherwise replace these facilities or generally arrange new or alternative methods of financing, our ability to finance additional loans utilizing these financing sources will end. The interest rates and other costs of new, renewed or amended facilities may also be higher than those currently in effect. If we are unable to renew or otherwise replace these facilities or generally arrange new or alternative methods of financing on favorable terms, we may be forced to curtail our origination of loans or reduce operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. It is possible that we may require capital in excess of amounts we currently anticipate. Depending on market conditions and other factors, we may not be able to obtain additional capital for our current operations or anticipated future growth on reasonable terms or at all.\nIn addition, in July 2017 the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. There is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of LIBOR or of any particular replacement rate. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our results of operations cannot yet be determined. In addition, any further changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of any LIBOR-linked loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in customer default rates could make us and our loans less attractive to lenders under debt facilities and investors in securitizations and institutional purchasers in OnDeck Marketplace which may adversely affect our access to financing and our business.\nWe principally rely on credit facilities and securitizations to fund our loans. Increases in customer default rates could make us and our loans less attractive to our existing (or prospective) funding sources. If our existing funding sources do not achieve their desired financial returns or if they suffer losses, they (or prospective funding sources) may increase the cost of providing future financing or refuse to provide future financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nOur debt facilities at our subsidiaries and our securitization are non-recourse to On Deck Capital, Inc. and are collateralized by our loans. If the loans securing such debt facilities and securitization fail to perform as expected, the lenders under our credit facilities and investors in our securitization, or future lenders or investors in similar arrangements, may increase the cost of providing financing or refuse to provide financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nIf we were to be unable to arrange new or alternative methods of financing on favorable terms, we may have to curtail or cease our origination of loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nWe are exposed to financial risks that may be partially mitigated but cannot be eliminated by our hedging activities, which carry their own risks.\nWe have used, and may in the future use, financial instruments for hedging and risk management purposes in order to protect against possible fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies or for other reasons that the we deem appropriate. For example, in December 2018 we entered into an interest rate cap to manage the risk on a portion of our variable-rate debt. The interest rate cap matures in January 2021 and would entitle us to receive payments from the counterparty if interest rates rise above a predetermined rate. However, our interest rate cap, and any future hedges we enter into, will not completely eliminate the risk associated with rising interest rates and our hedging activities may prove to be ineffective. Any such failure to eliminate the risks associated with rising interest rates may cause the amounts due under our debt facilities and other debt arrangements to increase due to changes in interest rates. Similar risks would be associated with attempts to hedge foreign currency exposure, and we would always be exposed to counterparty risk.\nThe success of our hedging strategy will be subject to our ability to correctly assess counterparty risk and the degree of correlation between the performance of the instruments used in the hedging strategy and any changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates, along with our ability to continually recalculate, readjust and execute hedges in an efficient and timely manner. Therefore, though we may enter into transactions to seek to reduce risks, unanticipated changes may create a more negative consequence than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the debt facilities, other debt arrangements or foreign currencies being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the effect of the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. Any failure to manage our hedging positions properly or inability to enter into hedging instruments upon acceptable terms could affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe require substantial capital and in the future may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and profitability strategy and, in particular, our ability to fund loan originations. If adequate capital is not available to us, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\nSince our founding, we have raised substantial equity and debt financing to support the growth of our business. Because we intend to continue to make investments to support the growth of our business, we may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and growth strategy and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, including lending to our customers, increasing our marketing expenditures to attract new customers and improving our brand awareness, developing and offering loans with new characteristics, introducing new loans or services, further expanding internationally in existing or new countries or further improving existing offerings and services, enhancing our operating infrastructure and potentially acquiring complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, on a regular basis we need, or we may need, to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. However, additional funds may not be available when we need them, in amounts we need, or permitted to be applied to specific use cases, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. In particular, we may require additional access to capital support our lending operations. Volatility in the credit markets in general or in the market for small business or internet loans in particular may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. Furthermore, the cost of our borrowing may increase due to market volatility, changes in the risk premiums required by lenders or if traditional sources of debt capital are unavailable. Volatility or depressed valuations or trading prices in the equity markets may similarly adversely affect our ability to obtain equity financing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock.\nWe expect that we will continue to use our available cash to fund a portion of our loan book, fund the portion of loans that exceeds the maximum percentage of collateral that may be financed through existing debt facilities, and to support our growth initiatives and general operations. To supplement our cash resources, we may seek to expand or modify our existing debt facilities to provide additional capacity, increase the maximum percentage of collateral that may be financed, as well as expand loan eligibility; add new debt facilities or replace or renew debt facilities scheduled to expire; enter into additional securitizations; increase the size of, or replace, our corporate debt facility; and other potential options. If we are unable to adequately maintain our cash resources, we may delay non-essential capital expenditures; implement cost cutting procedures; delay or reduce future hiring; or reduce our rate of future originations compared to current level. There can be no assurance that we can obtain sufficient sources of external capital to support the growth of our business. Delays in doing so or failure to do so may require us to reduce loan originations or reduce our operations, which would harm our ability to pursue our business objectives as well as harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not have adequate funding capacity in the event that an unforeseen number of customers to whom we have extended a line of credit decide to draw their lines at the same time.\nOur current capacity to fund our customers\u2019 lines of credit through existing debt facilities is limited. Accordingly, we maintain cash available to fund our customers\u2019 lines of credit based on the amount that we foresee these customers drawing down. For example, if we make available a line of credit for $15,000 to a small business, we may only reserve a portion of this amount at any given time for immediate draw down. We base the amount that we reserve on our analysis of aggregate portfolio demand and the historical activity of customers using these lines of credit. However, if we inaccurately predict the number of customers that draw down on their lines of credit at a certain time, or if these customers draw down in greater amounts than we forecast, we may not have enough funds available to lend to them. Failure to provide funds drawn down by our customers on their lines of credit may lead to negative customer experience, damage our reputation and inhibit our growth.\nOur agreements with our lenders contain a number of early payment triggers and covenants. A breach of such triggers or covenants or other terms of such agreements could result in an early amortization, default, and/or acceleration of the related funding facilities which could materially impact our operations.\nPrimary funding sources available to support the maintenance and growth of our business include, among others, an asset-backed securitization facility, other asset-backed revolving debt facilities and corporate debt. Our liquidity would be materially adversely affected by our inability to comply with various covenants and other specified requirements set forth in our agreements with our lenders which could result in the early amortization, default and/or acceleration of our existing facilities. Such covenants and requirements include financial covenants, portfolio performance covenants and other events. For a description of these covenants, requirements and events, see Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nDuring an early amortization period or occurrence of an event of default, principal collections from the loans in our asset-backed facilities would be applied to repay principal under such facilities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund purchases of newly originated loans. During the occurrence of an event of default under any of our facilities, the applicable lenders could accelerate the related debt and such lenders\u2019 commitments to extend further credit under the related facility would terminate. Our asset-backed securitization trust would not be able to issue future series out of such securitization if an early amortization event occurred. If we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under such facilities, the applicable lenders could seek remedies, including against the collateral pledged under such facilities. An acceleration of the debt under one facility could also lead to a default under other facilities due to cross-acceleration provisions.\nAn early amortization event or event of default would negatively impact our liquidity, including our ability to originate new loans, and require us to rely on alternative funding sources, which might increase our funding costs or which might not be available when needed. If we were unable to arrange new or alternative methods of financing on favorable terms, we might have to curtail the origination of loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations under our facilities.\nWe act as servicer with respect to our facilities. If we default in our servicing obligations, an early amortization event or default could occur with respect to the applicable facility and we could be replaced as servicer.\nIn connection with the sale of our loans to our subsidiaries, we make representations and warranties concerning the loans we sell. If those representations and warranties are not correct, we could be required to repurchase the loans. In addition, we may, from time to time, voluntarily purchase loans previously sold to third parties. Any significant required repurchases and/or voluntary purchases could have an adverse effect on our ability to operate and fund our business.\nIn our asset-backed securitization facility and our other asset-backed revolving debt facilities, we transfer loans to our subsidiaries and make numerous representations and warranties concerning the loans we transfer, including representations and warranties that the loans meet the eligibility respective requirements of such facilities. If the representations and warranties that the loans meet the eligibility requirements are incorrect, we may be required to repurchase the loans not satisfying the eligibility requirements. Failure to repurchase any loans when required would constitute an event of default under the securitization and other asset-backed facilities. At the request of a loan purchaser, we may voluntarily decide to purchase loans sold to third parties. There is no assurance, however, that we would have adequate resources to make such purchases or, if we did make the purchases, that such event might not have a material adverse effect on our business. From 2016 through 2018, we voluntarily purchased $21.3 million of loans for strategic business reasons and we may, from time to time, do so again in the future. The purchase of loans in large quantities, both on a mandatory or voluntary basis, may have an adverse impact on our liquidity and our ability to originate loans, especially if we are unable to refinance such loans and elect to rely on available cash to purchase them.\nFinancial regulatory reform relating to asset-backed securities has not been fully implemented and there is uncertainty regarding its continuation, both of which could have a significant impact on our ability to access the asset-backed market.\nWe rely upon asset-backed financing for a significant portion of our funds with which to carry on our business. Asset-backed securities and the securitization markets were heavily affected by the Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law in 2010, and have also been a focus of increased regulation by the SEC. However, some of the regulations to be implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act have not yet been finalized and other asset-backed regulations that have been adopted by the SEC have delayed effective dates. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act mandates the implementation of rules requiring securitizers or originators to retain an economic interest in a portion of the credit risk for any asset that they securitize or originate. In October 2014, the SEC adopted final rules in relation to such risk retention, but such rules did not become effective with respect to our transactions until late in 2016. In addition, the SEC previously proposed separate rules which would affect the disclosure requirements for registered as well as unregistered issuances of asset-backed securities. The SEC has recently adopted final rules which affect the disclosure requirements for registered issuances of asset-backed securities backed by residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto loans, auto leases and debt securities. However, final rules that would affect the disclosure requirements for registered issuances of asset-backed securities backed by other types of collateral or for unregistered issuances of asset-backed securities have not been adopted. Additionally, there is general uncertainty regarding what changes, if any, may be implemented with regards to the Dodd-Frank Act. Any new rules or changes to the Dodd-Frank Act (or the current rules thereunder), if implemented could adversely affect our ability to access the asset-backed market or our cost of accessing that market.\nOur business depends on our ability to fund our loans and collect payment on and service the loans we make to our customers.\nWe rely on unaffiliated banks for the Automated Clearing House, or ACH, transaction process used to disburse the proceeds of newly originated loans to our customers and to automatically collect scheduled payments on the loans. As we are not a bank, we do not have the ability to directly access the ACH payment network, and must therefore rely on an FDIC-insured depository institution to process our transactions, including loan payments. We also rely on the facilities of third parties for our line of credit instant funding option via small businesses debit cards. If we cannot continue to obtain such services from our current institutions or elsewhere, or if we cannot transition to another processor quickly, our ability to fund loans and process payments will suffer. If we fail to fund loans promptly as expected, we risk loss of customers and damage to our reputation which could materially harm our business. If we fail to adequately collect amounts owing in respect of the loans, as a result of the loss of direct debiting or otherwise, then payments to us may be delayed or reduced and our revenue and operating results will be harmed.\nWe rely on our management team and need additional key personnel to grow our business, and the loss of key employees or inability to hire key personnel could harm our business.\nWe believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our executives and employees, including Noah Breslow, our Chief Executive Officer. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. In addition, the loss of any of our senior management or key employees could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and strategy, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. Our executive officers and other employees are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nCompetition for our employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain highly skilled employees whom we need to support our business. Additionally, uncertainty about significant changes to immigration policy by the current administration has created uncertainty about the future of sponsoring current or prospective employees.\nCompetition for our employees, including and especially highly skilled engineering, data analytics and risk management professionals, is extremely intense reflecting a tight labor market, particularly in New York City. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced employees have greater resources than we have and may be able to offer more attractive financial terms of employment. In addition, candidates making employment decisions often consider the value of any equity they may receive in connection with their employment. Any significant volatility or performance issues in the price of our stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain highly skilled technical, financial, marketing and other personnel. In in order to pursue our growth strategy, we will be required to hire additional highly skilled engineering, data analytics and risk management personnel.\nIn addition, we also invest significant time and expense in engaging and developing our employees, which increases their value to other companies that may seek to recruit them. If we fail to retain our employees, we could incur significant expenses in\nhiring, engaging and developing their replacements and the quality of our services and our ability to serve our customers could diminish, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe current administration has called for significant changes to immigration policy. In this regard, there is significant uncertainty with respect to legislation, regulation and government policy at the federal level, as well as the state and local levels, as it relates to immigration. For example, recent U.S. immigration policy has made it more difficult for qualified foreign nationals to obtain or maintain work visas under the HB-1 classification. These HB-1 visa limitations make it more difficult and/or more expensive for us to hire the skilled professionals we need to execute our growth strategy, especially engineering, data analytics and risk management personnel, and may adversely impact our business.\nWe face increasing competition and, if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nWe compete with other companies that lend to small businesses. These companies include traditional banks, merchant cash advance providers, newer, technology-enabled lenders and so-called \"closed-loop lenders\" that both process sales and/or payments transactions for small businesses and offer loans to those small businesses. In addition, other technology companies that primarily lend to individual consumers have been focusing, or may in the future focus, their efforts on lending to small businesses. Competition has intensified in small business lending and this trend may continue.\nIn some cases, our competitors focus their marketing on our industry sectors and seek to increase their lending and other financial relationships with specific industries such as restaurants. In other cases, some competitors may offer a broader range of financial products to our clients, and some competitors may offer a specialized set of specific products or services. Many of these competitors have significantly more resources and greater brand recognition than we do and may be able to attract customers more effectively than we do. In addition, as more and more competitors market to the same small businesses, it may be more difficult and expensive for us to build our brand and achieve or maintain favorable customer response rates.\nWhen new competitors seek to enter one of our markets, or when existing market participants seek to increase their market share, they sometimes undercut the pricing and/or credit terms prevalent in that market, which could adversely affect our market share and/or ability to exploit new market opportunities. Our pricing and credit terms could deteriorate if we act to meet these competitive challenges. Further, to the extent that the commissions we pay to our strategic partners and funding advisors are not competitive with those paid by our competitors, whether on new loans or renewals or both, these partners and advisors may choose to direct their business elsewhere. Those competitive pressures could also result in us reducing the origination fees or interest we charge to our customers. In addition, increased competition for customer response could require us to incur higher customer acquisition costs and make it more difficult for us to grow our loan originations in both unit and volume for both new as well as repeat customers. All of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and future growth.\nOur success and future growth depend in part on our successful marketing efforts and increased brand awareness. As part of our cost rationalization program, we have reduced our investment in our brand. Failure to effectively use our brand to convert sales may negatively affect our growth and our financial performance.\nWe believe that an important component of our growth will be continued market penetration through marketing directly to small businesses. To achieve this growth, we anticipate relying on marketing and advertising while controlling customer acquisition cost. As part of our 2017 cost rationalization program, we reduced our investment in brand advertising while seeking to gain marketing efficiencies. While our goal remains to increase the strength, recognition and trust in the OnDeck brand, drive more unique visitors to submit loan applications on our website, and ultimately increase the number of loans made to our customers, our decision to reduce spending in this area and seek greater efficiencies could adversely affect our growth. We incurred expenses of $44.1 million and $52.8 million on sales and marketing in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOur business model relies on our ability to continue to scale and to decrease incremental customer acquisition costs as we grow. If we are unable to recover our marketing costs through increases in the number of loans we make, or if we maintain recent levels of brand investment or continue to reduce or discontinue our broad marketing campaigns, it could have a material adverse effect on our growth, results of operations and financial condition.\nTo the extent that funding advisor program partners, other third parties or internal sales representatives mislead loan applicants or engage or previously engaged in disreputable behavior, our reputation may be harmed and we may face liability.\nWe rely on third-party independent advisors, including commercial loan brokers, which we call funding advisor program partners, or FAPs, for a significant portion of the customers to whom we issue loans. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, loans issued to customers whose applications were submitted to us via the FAP channel constituted 29.4%, 26.9% and 27.3% of our total loan originations, respectively. As a consequence of their status as independent contractors who provide services for multiple lenders,\nwe have less control of FAP sales activities versus our internal sales representatives. In early 2015, we took a number of steps to enhance our then existing efforts to mitigate the risks associated with the FAP channel, as discussed below.\nBecause FAPs earn fees on a commission basis, FAPs may have an incentive to mislead loan applicants, facilitate the submission by loan applicants of false application data or engage in other disreputable behavior so as to earn additional commissions. In addition, it is possible that some FAPs may attempt to charge additional fees despite our contractual prohibitions. We also rely on our direct sales agents for customer acquisition in our direct marketing channel, who may also be motivated to engage in disreputable behavior to increase our customer base because such direct sales agents are paid on a commission basis. If FAPs or our direct sales agents mislead our customers or engage in any other disreputable behavior, our customers are less likely to be satisfied with their experience and to become repeat customers, and we may be subject to costly and time-consuming disputes, including lawsuits and fines from regulators, which could harm our reputation and operating performance. Negative publicity relating to FAPs or internal sales representatives could impair our ability to continue to increase our revenue and our business could otherwise be materially and negatively impacted.\nIn early 2015, we significantly enhanced the nature and scope of the due diligence conducted on both prospective and existing FAPs. We update such due diligence on all existing FAPs on an annual basis and continue to conduct enhanced due diligence on new prospective FAPs. We also implemented certain enhanced contractual provisions and compliance-related measures related to our funding advisor program, including FAP training, issuing a FAP code of conduct and conducting welcome calls or distributing welcome surveys to customers who worked with FAPs to survey the FAPs\u2019 practices (which, if in violation of our code or contract, could lead to termination). While these measures were intended to improve certain aspects and reduce the risks of how we work with funding advisors and how they work with our customers, we cannot assure that these measures will work or continue to work as intended, that other compliance-related concerns will not emerge in the future, that the funding advisors will comply with these measures, and that these measures will not negatively impact our business from this channel, including our financial performance, or have other unintended or negative impacts on our business beyond the FAP channel, such as with existing or potential strategic partners, customers or funding sources.\nIn addition, we do business with third parties who are not part of our funding advisor program, including third parties who may refer potential customers to us. Although such third parties are not supposed to sell or make representations about OnDeck products, but instead refer to our internal processes including our direct sales force, we are exposed to the risks of potential misleading or disreputable behavior from these third parties as well as from our FAPs.\nAs to our sales force, we provide our internal sales representatives with sales scripts that have been reviewed by our compliance team. Sales representatives receive rigorous training, including in-person training conducted by our compliance team on avoiding unfair, abusive, and deceptive practices. In addition, internal sales representative calls are recorded and monitored for purposes of compliance and quality assurance, and there is a quality assurance team dedicated to these efforts, which efforts have continued to be refined and enhanced. Despite these controls, we cannot assure that that they will work as intended or that all of our internal sales representatives will comply with our procedures. Failure of our internal sales representatives to do so would expose us to the same, or worse, consequences than those relating to the FAP channel because our direct sales channel is larger than our FAP channel and we have more direct control over our internal sales representatives than we have over our FAP channel. We also refer merchants to third party lenders. It is conceivable that we are exposed to risk if such third party lenders engage in wrongful behavior.\nWe pay commissions to our strategic partners, other third parties and FAPs upfront and generally do not recover them in the event the related term loan or line of credit is eventually charged off.\nWe pay commissions to strategic partners and FAPs on the term loans and lines of credit we originate through these channels. We pay these commissions at the time the term loan is originated or line of credit is opened. However, we generally do not require that this commission be repaid to us in the event of a default on a term loan or line of credit. While we generally discontinue working with strategic partners and FAPs that refer customers to us that ultimately have unacceptably high levels of defaults, to the extent that our strategic partners and FAPs are not at risk of forfeiting their commissions in the event of defaults, they may, to an extent, be indifferent to the riskiness of the potential customers that they refer to us.\nMany of our strategic partnerships are nonexclusive and subject to termination options that, if terminated, could harm the growth of our customer base and negatively affect our financial performance. Additionally, these partners are concentrated and the departure of a significant partner could have a negative impact on our operating results. Lastly, any termination of agreements governing our services platform that facilitates online lending to small business customers through ODX could have a negative impact on our ability to grow this part of our business and negatively impact our operating results.\nWe rely on strategic partners for referrals of an increasing portion of our customers and our growth depends in part on the growth of these referrals. Over the last five years, loans issued to customers referred to us by our strategic partners have grown to\nbecome an increasingly significant percentage of our total loan originations, a trend which we expect to continue as we are concentrated on this part of our business.\nMany of our strategic partnerships do not contain exclusivity provisions that would prevent such partners from providing leads to competing companies. In addition, the agreements governing these partnerships contain termination provisions that, if exercised, would terminate our relationship with these partners. Some segments of our partner base have agreements which do not contain a requirement that a partner refer us any minimum number of leads. There can be no assurance that these partners will not terminate our relationship with them or continue referring business to us in the future, and a termination of the relationship or reduction in leads referred to us would have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results.\nIn addition, a small number of strategic partners refer to us a significant portion of the loans made within this channel. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, loans issued to customers referred to us by our top four strategic partners constituted 11.6%, 11.1% and 12.0% of our total loan originations, respectively. In the event that one or more of these significant strategic partners terminated our relationship or reduced the number of leads provided to us, without some growth offset with other strategic partners, our business would be harmed.\nAdditionally, we have continued exploring ways to expand the availability of our services platform that facilitates online lending to small business customers through ODX to appropriate partners that could use our platform to make loan decisions. The agreements governing these services contain termination provisions that, if exercised, would terminate our agreement with these partners. A termination of any such agreements may affect our reputation as we seek to expand ODX, and/or have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results.\nAny violations of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, or the failure to detect any such violations, may cause our business, financial condition or results of operations to be adversely affected.\nOur Code of Business Conduct and Ethics prohibits us and our employees from engaging in unethical business practices. In addition, our FAPs are required to comply with a code of conduct, or the FAP Code, tailored to their brokering services. We refer to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and the FAP Code collectively referred to as the \u201cCode\u201d. However, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, agents, or contractors will refrain from acting in violation of our Code, or that we will be able to detect any such violations. The investigation into potential violations of our Code, or even allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction, and lead to significant costs and expenses, and such expenses may have a material adverse effect on our financial results. If we, or our employees, agents or contractors, are found to have engaged in practices that violate our Code, we could suffer severe fines, penalties or other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct by us, or our employees, agents or contractors acting on our behalf, in any number of activities or circumstances in violation of our Code, including employment related offenses, such as harassment (sexual or otherwise) and discrimination, regulatory compliance and the use and protection of data and systems, or from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct.\nIt may be difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nOur ability to lend to our customers depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology, including our loan decisioning process and the OnDeck Score. We may be unable to protect our proprietary technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate our business processes and know-how, and adversely affect our ability to compete with them. A third party may attempt to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without our consent. The pursuit of a claim against a third party for infringement of our intellectual property could be costly, and there can be no guarantee that any such efforts would be successful.\nIn addition, our platform may infringe upon claims of third-party intellectual property, and we may face intellectual property challenges from such other parties. We may not be successful in defending against any such challenges or in obtaining licenses to avoid or resolve any intellectual property disputes. The costs of defending any such claims or litigation could be significant and, if we are unsuccessful, could result in a requirement that we pay significant damages or licensing fees, which would negatively impact our financial performance. Furthermore, our technology may become obsolete, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop, obtain or use new technologies to adapt our platform to compete with other lending platforms as they develop. If we cannot protect our proprietary technology from intellectual property challenges, or if the platform becomes obsolete, our ability to maintain our platform, make loans or perform our servicing obligations on the loans could be adversely affected.\nSome aspects of our platform include open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.\nWe incorporate open source software into our proprietary platform and into other processes supporting our business. Such open source software may include software covered by licenses like the GNU General Public License and the Apache License or other open source licenses. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that limits our use of the software, inhibits certain aspects of the platform and negatively affects our business operations.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. If portions of our proprietary platform are determined to be subject to an open source license, or if the license terms for the open source software that we incorporate change, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our platform or change our business activities. In addition to risks related to license requirements, the use of open source software can lead to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated, and could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and the value of your investment could decline.\nStocks of emerging growth companies have experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock may be higher or lower than the price you pay, depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include the following:\n\u2022\nannouncements of new types of loans, services or technologies, relationships with strategic partners, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in prevailing interest rates;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general and of companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;\n\u2022\nthe impact of securities analysts\u2019 reports or other publicity regarding our business or industry;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our operating results or fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nquarterly fluctuations in demand for our loans;\n\u2022\nwhether our operating results meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries or both;\n\u2022\nmajor catastrophic events;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our stock; or\n\u2022\ndepartures of key personnel.\nIn addition, if the market for financial or technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. In the past we were subject to two putative securities class action litigations. While those cases were voluntarily dismissed, there can be no assurance that any future cases would ave a similar result.\nIf our stock price continues to be volatile, we may become the target of additional securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could reduce the price that our common stock might otherwise attain. In addition, issuances and sales by us of newly issued shares of our common stock can dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by us or our stockholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate. At December 31, 2018, we had 75,375,341 shares of common stock outstanding and as of that date stockholders known to us who beneficially owned 5% or more of our common stock owned in the aggregate 28,779,454 shares or 38%.\nWe may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments or otherwise. We have also registered the offer and sale of all shares of common stock that we may issue under our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan and 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders, reduce proportionate voting power and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nInsiders and large stockholders have or could have substantial control over us, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nOur directors, executive officers and each of our stockholders who own greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock and their affiliates, in the aggregate, own approximately 40% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, based on the number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, will be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. They may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act effective December 31, 2019. Among other things, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we have already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire even more employees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-\ngenerating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nOnce we lose our \"emerging growth company\u201d status, we may no longer take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d As a result, we will be required to comply with the independent auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, increased disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and requirements to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe also expect that these new rules, regulations and standards may make it more expensive for us as a public company to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, and Risk Management Committee.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until December 31, 2019 and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, until December 31, 2019. While we are an \"emerging growth company\" we are taking advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile and may decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, to some extent, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our shares, change their opinion of our shares or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts should cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our president, our secretary or a majority vote of our board of directors, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our amended and restated bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquiror to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend the bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquiror to amend the bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time.", "PERMNO": 15110, "SIC": 6159, "TIC": "ONDK"}
