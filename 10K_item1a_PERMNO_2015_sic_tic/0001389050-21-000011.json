{"cik": "1389050", "company": "Archrock, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAs described in \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d this 2020 Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements regarding us, our business and our industry. The risk factors described below, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nIndustry and General Economic Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue to significantly reduce demand for our services, and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken by businesses and governments, have resulted in a significant and swift reduction in U.S. economic activity. These effects have materially adversely affected the demand for oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas, and have had, and are expected to continue to have, a negative impact on demand for our services and products. The collapse in the demand for oil caused by this unprecedented global health and economic crisis, coupled with oil oversupply, is expected to continue to adversely impact the demand for our services, which in turn could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWhile the magnitude and duration of potential social, economic and labor instability as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be estimated at this time, we are closely monitoring the effects of the pandemic on commodity demands and on our customers, as well as on our operations and employees. These effects may include adverse revenue and net income effects; disruptions to our operations and supply chain; customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production; employee impacts from illness, school closures and other community response measures; and temporary inaccessibility or closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers.\nThe extent to which our operating and financial results continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic; and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus. The COVID-19 pandemic may materially adversely affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nOur operations entail inherent risks that may result in substantial liability. We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.\nOur operations entail inherent risks, including equipment defects, malfunctions and failures and natural disasters, which could result in uncontrollable flows of natural gas or well fluids, fires and explosions. These risks may expose us, as an equipment operator, to liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, pollution and other environmental damage. The insurance we carry against many of these risks may not be adequate to cover our claims or losses. Our insurance coverage includes property damage, general liability and commercial automobile liability and other coverage we believe is appropriate. Additionally, we are substantially self-insured for workers\u2019 compensation and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per-incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks. We are also self-insured for property damage to our offshore assets. Further, insurance covering the risks we expect to face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future or, if available, the premiums may not be commercially justifiable. If we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nWe face significant competitive pressures that may cause us to lose market share and harm our financial performance.\nOur business is highly competitive and there are low barriers to entry. Our competitors may be able to more quickly adapt to technological changes within our industry and changes in economic and market conditions as a whole, more readily take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Our ability to renew or replace existing contract operations service contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors. If our competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to the development and marketing of competitive products, equipment or services or substantially decrease the price at which they offer their products, equipment or services, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nIn addition, we could face significant competition from new entrants into the compression services business. Some of our existing competitors or new entrants may expand or fabricate new compressors that would create additional competition for the services we provide to our customers. In addition, our customers may purchase and operate their own compression fleets in lieu of using our natural gas compression services. We also may not be able to take advantage of certain opportunities or make certain investments because of our debt levels and our other obligations. Any of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, our future growth could be limited.\nOur ability to grow depends, in part, on our ability to make accretive acquisitions. If we are unable to make accretive acquisitions either because we are (i) unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with them, (ii) unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or (iii) outbid by competitors, then our future growth and ability to maintain dividends could be limited. Furthermore, even if we make acquisitions that we believe will be accretive, these acquisitions may nevertheless result in a decrease in the cash generated from operations per unit.\nAny acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u25cf an inability to integrate successfully the businesses we acquire;\n\u25cf the assumption of unknown liabilities;\n\u25cf limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;\n\u25cf mistaken assumptions about the cash generated or anticipated to be generated by the business acquired or the overall costs of equity or debt;\n\u25cf the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf unforeseen operating difficulties; and\n\u25cf customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses.\nIf we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly and we will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of our future funds and other resources. In addition, competition from other buyers could reduce our acquisition opportunities or cause us to pay a higher price than we might otherwise pay.\nFollowing the closing of the Elite Acquisition, an affiliate of Hilcorp holds a significant portion of our common stock, and Hilcorp\u2019s interest as an equity holder may conflict with the interests of our other shareholders or our noteholders.\nIn connection with the closing of the Elite Acquisition, JDH Capital, an affiliate of Hilcorp, received 21.7 million shares of our common stock, representing 14.2% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2020. As long as JDH Capital, together with affiliates of Hilcorp, owns at least 7.5% of our outstanding common stock, it will have the right to nominate one director to our Board of Directors. Given its ownership level and board representation, JDH Capital may have some influence over our operations and strategic direction and may have interests that conflict with the interests of other equity and debt holders.\nWhile we paid quarterly dividends of $0.145 per share of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2020, there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends in the future.\nWe paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.145 per share of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2020. We cannot provide assurance that we will, at any time in the future, again generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend or that our Board of Directors would determine to use any such surplus or our net profits to pay a dividend.\nFuture dividends may be affected by, among other factors:\n\u25cf the availability of surplus or net profits, which in turn depend on the performance of our business and operating subsidiaries;\n\u25cf our debt service requirements and other liabilities;\n\u25cf our ability to refinance our debt in the future or borrow funds and access capital markets;\n\u25cf restrictions contained in our debt agreements;\n\u25cf our future capital requirements, including to fund our operating expenses and other working capital needs;\n\u25cf the rates we charge for our services;\n\u25cf the level of demand for our services;\n\u25cf the creditworthiness of our customers;\n\u25cf our level of operating expenses; and\n\u25cf changes in U.S. federal, state and local income tax laws or corporate laws.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will declare or pay dividends in any particular amount or at all in the future. A decision not to pay dividends or a reduction in our dividend payments in the future could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nFinancial Risks\nWe have a substantial amount of debt that could limit our ability to fund future growth and operations and increase our exposure to risk during adverse economic conditions.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $1.7 billion in outstanding debt obligations, net of unamortized debt discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs. Many factors, including factors beyond our control, may affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness. These factors include those discussed elsewhere in these Risk Factors.\nOur substantial debt and associated commitments could have important adverse consequences to our liquidity, particularly to the extent our borrowing capacity becomes covenant restricted. For example, these commitments could:\n\u25cf make it more difficult for us to satisfy our contractual obligations;\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf limit our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other corporate requirements;\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because the interest payments on a portion of our debt are based upon variable interest rates and a portion can adjust based on our credit statistics;\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u25cf place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or less restrictive covenants in such debt; and\n\u25cf limit our ability to incur indebtedness in the future.\nCovenants in our Debt Agreements may impair our ability to operate our business.\nOur Debt Agreements contain various covenants with which we or certain of our subsidiaries must comply, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the use of proceeds from borrowings, limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, investments, acquisitions, making loans, liens on assets, repurchasing equity, making dividends or distributions, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, dispositions of assets and other provisions customary in similar types of agreements. The Debt Agreements also contain various covenants requiring mandatory prepayments from the net cash proceeds of certain asset transfers.\nThe Credit Facility is also subject to financial covenants, including the following ratios after giving effect to Amendment No. 3, as defined in the corresponding agreement:\n(1) Subject to a temporary increase to 5.50 to 1.0 for any quarter during which an acquisition satisfying certain thresholds is completed and for the two quarters immediately following such quarter.\nIf we were to anticipate non-compliance with these financial ratios, we may take actions to maintain compliance with them. These actions include reductions in its general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures or the payment of cash distributions. Any of these measures may reduce the amount of cash available for payment of dividends and the funding of our business requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operations, cash flows or the price of our common stock.\nThe breach of any of the covenants under the Debt Agreements could result in a default under the Debt Agreements, which could cause indebtedness under the Debt Agreements to become due and payable. If the repayment obligations under the Debt Agreements were to be accelerated, we may not be able to repay the debt or refinance the debt on acceptable terms and our financial position would be materially adversely affected. A material adverse effect on our assets, liabilities, financial condition, business or operations that, taken as a whole, impacts our ability to perform the obligations under the Debt Agreements could lead to a default under those agreements. Further, a default under one or more of the Debt Agreements would trigger cross-default provisions under the other Debt Agreements, which would accelerate our obligation to repay the indebtedness under those agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Debt Agreements.\nWe may be unable to access the capital and credit markets or borrow on affordable terms to obtain additional capital that we may require.\nHistorically, we have financed acquisitions, operating expenditures and capital expenditures with a combination of cash provided by operating and financing activities. However, to the extent we are unable to finance our operating expenditures, capital expenditures, scheduled interest and debt repayments and any future dividends with net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the Credit Facility, we may require additional capital. Periods of instability in the capital and credit markets (both generally and in the oil and gas industry in particular) could limit our ability to access these markets to raise debt or equity capital on affordable terms or to obtain additional financing. Among other things, our lenders may seek to increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt at maturity at favorable terms or at all and may reduce or cease to provide funding to us. If we are unable to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, or if we are not successful in raising capital within the time period required or at all, we may not be able to grow or maintain our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to fund purchases of additional compression equipment could adversely impact our financial results.\nWe may not be able to maintain or increase our asset and customer base unless we have access to sufficient capital to purchase additional compression equipment. Cash flow from our operations and availability under our Credit Facility may not provide us with sufficient cash to fund our capital expenditure requirements, including any funding requirements related to acquisitions. Our ability to grow our asset and customer base could be impacted by limits on our ability to access additional capital.\nWe may be vulnerable to interest rate increases due to our variable rate debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, after taking into consideration interest rate swaps, we had $93.0 million of outstanding indebtedness that was effectively subject to variable interest rates. Changes in economic conditions outside of our control could result in higher interest rates, thereby increasing our interest expense and reducing the funds available for capital investment, operations or other purposes. A 1% increase in the effective interest rate on our outstanding debt subject to variable interest rates at December 31, 2020 would result in an annual increase in our interest expense of $0.9 million. In addition, a substantial portion of our cash flow must be used to service our debt obligations. Any increase in our interest expense could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows, including our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nUncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the market value of our current or future debt obligations, including our Credit Facility.\nOn July 27, 2017, the FCA announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. As a result, LIBOR may be discontinued by 2022. Furthermore, in the U.S., efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates that could replace LIBOR include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In addition, any other legal or regulatory changes made by the FCA, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, the European Money Markets Institute (formerly Euribor-EBF), the European Commission or any other successor governance or oversight body, or future changes adopted by such body, in the method by which LIBOR is determined or the transition from LIBOR to a successor benchmark may result in, among other things, a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in LIBOR, a delay in the publication of LIBOR and changes in the rules or methodologies in LIBOR, which may discourage market participants from continuing to administer or to participate in LIBOR\u2019s determination. This could result in LIBOR no longer being determined or published. If a published U.S. dollar LIBOR rate is unavailable after 2021, the interest rate paid on our current or future debt obligations, including the Credit Facility, will need to be determined using alternative methods, which may result in interest obligations which are more than or do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on any current of future debt obligations, including the Credit Facility, if U.S. dollar LIBOR was available in its current form.\nAt this time, it is not possible to predict whether any such changes will occur, whether LIBOR will be phased out or any such alternative reference rates or other reforms to LIBOR will be enacted in the United Kingdom, the U.S. or elsewhere or the effect that any such changes, phase out, alternative reference rates or other reforms, if they occur, would have on the amount of interest paid on, or the market value of, our current or future debt obligations, including the Credit Facility. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, phase out, alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect the terms of the Credit Facility and any interest rate swaps or other derivative agreements to which we are a party. Reform of, or the replacement or phasing out of, LIBOR and proposed regulation of LIBOR and other \u201cbenchmarks\u201d may materially adversely affect the market value of, the applicable interest rate on and the amount of interest paid on our current or future debt obligations, including the Credit Facility. In addition, even if we have entered into interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments for purposes of managing our interest rate exposure, our hedging strategies may not be effective as a result of the replacement or phasing out of LIBOR and other \u201cbenchmarks\u201d and we may incur substantial losses as a result.\nCustomer and Contract Risks\nThe erosion of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business.\nMany of our customers finance their exploration and production activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. During times when the oil or natural gas markets weaken, our customers are more likely to experience a downturn in their financial condition. Additionally, some of our midstream customers may provide their gathering, transportation and related services to a limited number of companies in the oil and gas production business. A reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities, the lack of availability of debt or equity financing or other factors that negatively impact our customers\u2019 financial condition could result in a reduction in our customers\u2019 spending for our products and services, which may result in their cancellation of contracts, the cancellation or delay of scheduled maintenance of their existing natural gas compression equipment, their determination not to enter into new natural gas compression service contracts or their determination to cancel or delay orders for our services. Furthermore, the loss by our midstream customers of their key customers could reduce demand for their services and result in a deterioration of their financial condition, which would in turn decrease their demand for our services. Any such action by our customers would reduce demand for our services. Reduced demand for our services could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, in the event of the financial failure of a customer, we could experience a loss on all or a portion of our outstanding accounts receivable associated with that customer.\nThe loss of any of our most significant customers would result in a decline in our revenue and cash available to pay dividends to our common stockholders.\nOur five most significant customers collectively accounted for 28%, 25% and 26% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our services are provided to these customers pursuant to contract compression services agreements, which typically have an initial term of 12 to 48 months and continue thereafter until terminated by either party with 30 days\u2019 advance notice. The loss of all or even a portion of the services we provide to these customers, as a result of competition or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany of our contract operations services contracts have short initial terms and are cancelable on short notice after the initial term, and we cannot be sure that such contracts will be extended or renewed after the end of the initial contractual term. Any such nonrenewals, or renewals at reduced rates or the loss of contracts with any significant customer could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe length of our contract operations services contracts with customers varies based on operating conditions and customer needs. Our initial contract terms typically are not long enough to enable us to recoup the cost of the equipment we utilize to provide contract operations services and these contracts are typically cancelable on short notice after the initial term. We cannot be sure that a substantial number of these contracts will be extended or renewed by our customers or that any of our customers will continue to contract with us. The inability to negotiate extensions or renew a substantial portion of our contract operations services contracts, the renewal of such contracts at reduced rates, the inability to contract for additional services with our customers or the loss of all or a significant portion of our services contracts with any significant customer could lead to a reduction in revenue and net income and could require us to record asset impairments. This could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nLabor and Supply Chain Risks\nOur ability to manage and grow our business effectively may be adversely affected if we lose management or operational personnel.\nWe believe that our ability to hire, train and retain qualified personnel will continue to be challenging and important. The supply of experienced operational and field personnel, in particular, decreases as other energy companies\u2019 needs for the same personnel increase. Our ability to grow and to continue our current level of service to our customers will be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully hire, train and retain these important personnel.\nWe depend on particular suppliers and are vulnerable to product shortages and price increases. With respect to our suppliers of newly-fabricated compression equipment specifically, we occasionally experience long lead times, and therefore may at times make purchases in anticipation of future business. If we are unable to purchase compression equipment or other integral equipment, materials and services from third party suppliers, we may be unable to retain existing customers or compete for new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome equipment, materials and services used in our business are obtained from a limited group of suppliers. Our reliance on these suppliers involves several risks, including price increases, inferior quality and a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of such equipment, materials and services in a timely manner. Additionally, we occasionally experience long lead times from our suppliers of newly-fabricated compression equipment and may at times make purchases in anticipation of future business. We do not have long-term contracts with some of these suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of certain of these suppliers could have a negative impact on our results of operations and could damage our customer relationships. Further, a significant increase in the price of such equipment, materials and services could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to purchase compression equipment in particular on a timely basis to meet the demands of our customers, our existing customers may terminate their contractual relationships with us, or we may not be able to compete for business from new or existing customers, which, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInformation Technology and Cybersecurity Risks\nWe may not realize the intended benefits of our technology transformation project, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we began a process and technology transformation project that will, among other things, upgrade or replace our existing ERP, supply chain and inventory management systems and expand the remote monitoring capabilities of our compression fleet. By using technology to make our systems and processes more efficient, we intend to lower our internal costs and improve our profitability over time. However, the implementation of the technology transformation project requires capital and other resources, and we anticipate that the project will continue to require significant resources and result in increased SG&A expense and capital expenditures in 2021. Further, we may not realize the benefits we expect to realize from the technology transformation project. Any such difficulties could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThreats of cyber-attacks or terrorism could affect our business.\nWe may be threatened by problems such as cyber-attacks, computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results. Our industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite our implementation of security measures, our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes. If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we might be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our assets may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to service our customers. We may be required by our regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict. The implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance, to the extent available, addressing such activities could increase costs. These types of events could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, these types of events could require significant management attention and resources and could adversely affect our reputation among customers and the public.\nTax-related Risks\nTax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in locations throughout the U.S. and, as a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state and local governments. From time to time, various legislative or administrative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our tax provision or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, U.S. federal, state and local tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.\nOur ability to use NOLs to offset future income may be limited.\nOur ability to use any NOLs generated by us could be substantially limited if we were to experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Code. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d would occur if our \u201c5-percent stockholders,\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Code, including certain groups of persons treated as \u201c5-percent stockholders,\u201d collectively increased their ownership in us by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. An ownership change can occur as a result of a public offering of our common stock, as well as through secondary market purchases of our common stock and certain types of reorganization transactions. We have experienced ownership changes, which may result in an annual limitation on the use of its pre-ownership change NOLs (and certain other losses and/or credits) equal to the equity value of our stock immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate for the month in which the ownership change occurs. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Federal Reserve has lowered the long-term tax-exempt rate. Market volatility due to reduced demand from the COVID-19 pandemic and oil oversupply and the related decrease in our equity value may cause increased interest in our common stock, which may result in an additional ownership change. Both of these changes could further limit our use of pre-ownership change NOLs if we experienced an additional ownership change. Furthermore, the IRS has recently proposed regulations that would prevent us from using unrealized built-in gains to increase this limitation. If these regulations were finalized and we experienced an ownership change our ability to use our NOLs may be limited. Such a limitation could, for any given year, have the effect of increasing the amount of our U.S. federal income tax liability, which would negatively impact the amount of after-tax cash available for distribution to our stockholders and our financial condition.\nWe are subject to continuing contingent tax liabilities following the Spin-off.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, we entered into a tax matters agreement with Exterran Corporation that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the Exterran Holdings consolidated U.S. federal and state tax reporting group between us and Exterran Corporation. If Exterran Corporation is unable to pay any prior period taxes related to these consolidated U.S. federal and state tax filings for which it is responsible, we would be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes.\nWe might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances because of certain restrictions relating to requirements for tax-free distributions.\nOur ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted in order to preserve, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax-free nature of the Spin-off. Even if the Spin-off otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code, it may result in corporate-level taxable gain to us under Section 355(e) of the Code if there is a 50% or greater change in ownership, by vote or value, of shares of our stock, Exterran Corporation\u2019s stock or the stock of a successor either occurring as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Spin-off.\nUnder the tax matters agreement that we entered into with Exterran Corporation, we are prohibited from taking or failing to take any action that prevents the Spin-off from being tax-free.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business. Moreover, the tax matters agreement also may provide that we are responsible for any taxes imposed on us or any of our affiliates as a result of the failure of the Spin-off to qualify for favorable treatment under the Code if such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the Spin-off by or in respect of us, any of our affiliates or our shareholders.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various claims, tax audits, litigation and other proceedings that could ultimately be resolved against us and require material future cash payments or charges, which could impair our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe size, nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to various claims, tax audits, litigation and binding arbitration proceedings. We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to various claims, which, if not resolved within amounts we have accrued, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, including our ability to pay dividends. Similarly, any claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future. See Part I Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Note 26 (\u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d) to our Financial Statements for additional information regarding certain legal proceedings to which we are a party.\nU.S. federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect demand for our contract operations services.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. We do not perform hydraulic fracturing, but many of our customers do. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state agencies, but recently, there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies, and proposals have been made to enact separate U.S. federal, state and local legislation that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing.\nFor example, at the U.S. federal level, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to collect data on chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations under Section 8 of the Toxic Substances Control Act and proposed regulations under the CWA governing wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and certain other natural gas operations. On March 26, 2015, the BoLM released a final rule that updates existing regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on U.S. federal lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, wellbore integrity and handling of flowback water. The final rule never went into effect due to pending litigation and on December 28, 2017, the BoLM announced that it had rescinded the 2015 final rule, in part citing a review that found that 32 of the 32 states with federal oil and gas leases have regulations that already address hydraulic fracturing.\nOn January 27, 2021, the new administration issued an executive order directing the Secretary of the Interior to pause all new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices in light of potential climate and other impacts associated with oil and natural gas activities thereon. Legal challenges to the suspension have already been filed and are currently pending.\nAt the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, in May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. Local governments may also seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. If new or more stringent U.S. federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where our natural gas exploration and production customers operate, those customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. Any such restrictions could reduce demand for our contract operations services, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNew regulations, proposed regulations and proposed modifications to existing regulations under the CAA, if implemented, could result in increased compliance costs.\nOn June 3, 2016, the EPA issued final regulations amending the NSPS for the oil and natural gas source category and applying to sources of emissions of methane and VOC from certain processes, activities and equipment that is constructed, modified or reconstructed after September 18, 2015. Specifically, the regulation contains both methane and VOC standards for several emission sources not previously covered by the NSPS, such as fugitive emissions from compressor stations and pneumatic pumps and methane standards for certain emission sources that are already regulated for VOC, such as equipment leaks at natural gas processing plants. The amendments also establish methane standards for a subset of equipment that the current NSPS regulates, including reciprocating compressors and pneumatic controllers, and extend the current VOC standards to the remaining unregulated equipment. On August 13, 2020, the EPA adopted deregulatory amendments to the 2016 rule intended to streamline implementation, reduce duplicative EPA and state requirements and decrease the burden of compliance. In particular, the amendments removed the transmission and storage segments from the oil and natural gas source category and rescinded the methane-specific requirements for production and processing facilities. Several lawsuits were filed challenging these amendments, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ordered an administrative stay of these amendments shortly after they were finalized. Although the administrative stay was lifted in October 2020, which brought the amendments into effect, the amendments may still be subject to reversal under the new presidential administration. However, on January 20, 2021, the new administration issued an executive order calling on the EPA to, among other things, consider a proposed rule suspending, revising or rescinding those deregulatory amendments by September 2021. We do not believe that the current rules will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, but we cannot yet predict the impact, if any, of any such suspension, revision or rescinding of the current rules.\nOn November 18, 2016, the BoLM published final rules to reduce venting and flaring on federal and tribal lands. The rules set forth some novel requirements regarding leak detection inspections at compressor stations and imposed requirements to reduce emissions from pneumatic controllers and pumps, among other things. While the BoLM adopted a rule in 2018 rescinding most of these requirements, that 2018 rule was challenged in court and vacated in July 2020. Following that ruling, another court, which had been hearing challenges to the original 2016 rule, acted on some pending litigation in October 2020 and vacated much of the 2016 rule.\nOn October 1, 2015, the EPA issued a new NAAQS ozone standard of 70 ppb, which is a tightening from the 75 ppb standard set in 2008. This new standard became effective on December 28, 2015, and the EPA completed designating attainment/non-attainment regions under the revised ozone standard in 2018. In November 2016, the EPA proposed an implementation rule for the 2015 NAAQS ozone standard, but the agency has yet to issue a final implementation rule. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our customers\u2019 ability to obtain such permits and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. By law, the EPA must review each NAAQS every five years. In December 2018 and again in December 2020, the EPA announced that it was retaining without revision the 2015 NAAQS ozone standard. However, on January 20, 2021, the new administration issued an executive order calling on the EPA to, among other things, propose a Federal Implementation Plan in response to the 2016 NAAQS for California, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas by January 2022. We do not believe continued implementation of the NAAQS ozone standard will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, but we cannot yet predict the impact, if any, of any new Federal Implementation Plan.\nIn January 2011, the TCEQ finalized revisions to certain air permit programs that significantly increase air emissions-related requirements for new and certain existing oil and gas production and gathering sites in the Barnett Shale production area. The final rule established new emissions standards for engines, which could impact the operation of specific categories of engines by requiring the use of alternative engines, compressor packages or the installation of aftermarket emissions control equipment. The rule became effective for the Barnett Shale production area in April 2011, and the lower emissions standards will become applicable between 2020 and 2030 depending on the type of engine and the permitting requirements. A number of other states where our engines are operated have adopted or are considering adopting additional regulations that could impose new air permitting or pollution control requirements for engines, some of which could entail material costs to comply. At this time, however, we cannot predict whether any such rules would require us to incur material costs.\nNew environmental regulations and proposals similar to these, when finalized, and any other new regulations requiring the installation of more sophisticated pollution control equipment or the adoption of other environmental protection measures, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a variety of governmental regulations; failure to comply with these regulations may result in administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures and changes in these regulations could increase our costs or liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, including relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment and taxation. Many of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including assessment of monetary penalties, imposition of remedial requirements and issuance of injunctions as to future compliance. From time to time, as part of our operations, including newly acquired operations, we may be subject to compliance audits by regulatory authorities in the various states in which we operate.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, which may render us liable for remediation costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior owners or operators or other third parties. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for neighboring land owners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs. Remediation costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations, and costs associated with new information, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could negatively impact our financial condition, profitability and results of operations. Moreover, failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations.\nWe may need to apply for or amend facility permits or licenses from time to time with respect to storm water or wastewater discharges, waste handling, or air emissions relating to manufacturing activities or equipment operations, which subjects us to new or revised permitting conditions that may be onerous or costly to comply with. In addition, certain of our customer service arrangements may require us to operate, on behalf of a specific customer, petroleum storage units such as underground tanks or pipelines and other regulated units, all of which may impose additional compliance and permitting obligations.\nWe conduct operations at numerous facilities in a wide variety of locations across the continental U.S. The operations at many of these facilities require environmental permits or other authorizations. Additionally, natural gas compressors at many of our customers\u2019 facilities require individual air permits or general authorizations to operate under various air regulatory programs established by rule or regulation. These permits and authorizations frequently contain numerous compliance requirements, including monitoring and reporting obligations and operational restrictions, such as emission limits. Given the large number of facilities in which we operate, and the numerous environmental permits and other authorizations that are applicable to our operations, we may occasionally identify or be notified of technical violations of certain requirements existing in various permits or other authorizations. Occasionally, we have been assessed penalties for our non-compliance, and we could be subject to such penalties in the future.\nWe routinely deal with natural gas, oil and other petroleum products. Hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on, under or from properties used by us to provide contract operations services or inactive compression storage or on or under other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties may be subject to investigatory, remediation and monitoring requirements under environmental laws and regulations.\nThe modification or interpretation of existing environmental laws or regulations, the more vigorous enforcement of existing environmental laws or regulations, or the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may also negatively impact oil and natural gas exploration and production, gathering and pipeline companies, including our customers, which in turn could have a negative impact on us.\nClimate change legislation, regulatory initiatives and stakeholder pressures could result in increased compliance costs, financial risks and potential reduction in demand for our services.\nClimate change legislation and regulatory initiatives may occur from a variety of sources, including international, national, regional and state levels of government and associated administrative bodies, seeking to restrict or regulate emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. At the international level, the Paris Agreement, which went into effect in November 2016, seeks to combat climate change through the establishment of individually-determined greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals. U.S. climate change strategy and implementation of that strategy through legislation and regulation may change from one administration to the next, as President Biden has recently recommitted the U.S. to the Paris Agreement after his predecessor withdrew the U.S. from the agreement. Given this uncertainty, U.S. companies may need to remain prepared to comply with requirements arising from participation in the Paris Agreement going forward. It has become increasingly likely that the U.S. will develop federal climate legislation in addition to existing energy legislation and other initiatives relevant to greenhouse gas emissions issues. Many U.S. states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun to address greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Although most of the state-level initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as electric power plants, it is possible that smaller sources such as our natural gas-powered compressors could become subject to greenhouse gas-related regulation. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to control emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations.\nThe legislative landscape continues to change and to be met with legal challenges with respect to climate-related laws and regulations, making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact they will have on the company in the aggregate. Although it is not currently possible to predict how any proposed or future greenhouse gas legislation or regulation promulgated at the international, national, state or local levels will impact our business, any regulation of greenhouse gas emissions that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions or reduced demand for our services, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nApart from governmental regulation, there are also increasing financial risks for companies in the energy sector as shareholders and bondholders currently invested in energy companies may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments toward non-fossil fuel energy sources. In recent years there have been increased efforts to encourage the consideration of ESG practices of companies in making investment decisions and, as a result, investment banks and asset managers based both domestically and internationally have announced that they are adopting climate change guidelines for their banking and investing activities. Institutional lenders who provide financing to energy companies such as ourselves have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices, and some may elect not to provide traditional energy producers or companies that support such producers with funding. ESG considerations may also affect others in the investment community, including investment advisers, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds and other groups, and may result in their divestment of energy-related equities. Limitation of investments in and financings for energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of infrastructure projects and energy production activities. This potential for reduced access to the capital and financial markets, whether impacting our customers and/or our company, may further adversely affect the demand for and price of our securities.\nFurthermore, at this time, there is significant uncertainty with respect to the extent to which climate change may lead to more extreme weather patterns, but it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere can change the climate in a manner that results in significant weather-related effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other such events. Energy needs could increase or decrease as a result of extreme weather conditions depending on the duration and magnitude of any such climate changes. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in order to serve increased demand. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition through decreased revenues. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing service. If any of these results occur, it could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations and cause us to incur costs in preparing for and responding to them.\nIn sum, any legislation, regulatory programs or social pressures related to climate change could increase our costs and require substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs, reduce demand for our services and reduce our access to financial markets. Current, as well as potential future, laws and regulations that limit emissions of greenhouse gases or that otherwise promote the use of renewable energy over fossil fuel energy sources could increase the cost of our midstream services and, thereby, further reduce demand and adversely affect the company\u2019s sales volumes, revenues and margins.\nIncreased environmental, social and governance scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders may impose additional costs or additional risks.\nIn recent years, increasing attention has been given to corporate activities related to ESG matters. A number of advocacy groups, both domestically and internationally, have campaigned for governmental and private action to promote change at public companies related to ESG matters, including increasing attention and demands for action related to climate change, promoting the use of substitutes to fossil fuel products and encouraging the divestment of companies in the fossil fuel industry. Companies which do not adapt to or comply with expectations and standards on ESG matters, as they continue to evolve, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition and/or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur operations, projects and growth opportunities require us to have strong relationships with various key stakeholders, including our shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers, local communities and others. We may face pressures from stakeholders, many of whom are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize sustainable energy practices, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability while at the same time remaining a successfully operating public company. If we do not successfully manage expectations across these varied stakeholder interests, it could erode our stakeholder trust and thereby affect our brand and reputation. Such erosion of confidence could negatively impact our business through decreased demand and growth opportunities, delays in projects, increased legal action and regulatory oversight, adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements, difficulty hiring and retaining top talent, difficulty obtaining necessary approvals and permits from governments and regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on acceptable terms, and difficulty securing investors and access to capital. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 92245, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "AROC"}
