{"cik": "40211", "company": "GATX CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestors should consider the risk factors described below as well as other information contained in this filing or our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before investing in our securities. If any of the events described in the risk factors below occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have been, and may continue to be, involved in various types of litigation, including claims for personal injury, property damage, environmental damage, and other claims arising from an accident involving our railcars or other assets.\nThe nature of our business and assets potentially exposes us to significant personal injury and property damage claims and litigation, environmental claims, or other types of lawsuits inside and outside the U.S. For example, some of our customers use certain types of our rail assets to transport flammable liquids and other hazardous materials, and an accident involving such rail assets could lead to litigation and subject us to significant liability. Similarly, if we fail to meet our obligations to maintain our assets in compliance with governmental regulations and industry rules, we could be subject to fines, penalties, and claims for such failure as well as any resulting personal injury or property damage. In some jurisdictions, an accident can give rise to both civil and criminal liabilities for us and, in some cases, our employees. In the event of an unfavorable outcome, we could be subject to substantial penalties or monetary damages, including criminal penalties and fines, and our employees who are named as criminal defendants in any such litigation may be subject to incarceration and fines. A substantial adverse judgment against us could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation.\nWe depend on continued demand from our customers to lease or use our transportation assets and services at satisfactory rates. A significant decline in customer demand could negatively impact our business and financial performance.\nOur profitability depends on our ability to lease assets at satisfactory rates and to re-lease assets upon lease expiration. Customer demand for our transportation assets and services can be adversely affected by various economic and other factors, including:\n\u2022Weak macroeconomic conditions\n\u2022Weak market conditions in our customers\u2019 businesses\n\u2022Declines in harvest or production volumes\n\u2022Adverse changes in the price of, or demand for, commodities\n\u2022Changes in railroad operations and efficiency\n\u2022Changes in railroad pricing and service offerings, including those related to \"precision scheduled railroading\"\n\u2022Changes in supply chains\n\u2022Availability of pipelines, trucks, and other alternative modes of transportation\n\u2022Conditions on the Great Lakes\n\u2022Changes in conditions affecting the aviation industry, including geographic exposure and customer concentrations\n\u2022Other operational or commercial needs or decisions of our customers\n\u2022World trade policies\nDemand for our railcars and other assets is dependent on the strength and growth of our customers' businesses. Some of our customers operate in cyclical markets, such as the steel, energy, chemical, transportation, and construction industries, which are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns and may experience significant changes in demand over time. Weakness in certain sectors of the economy in the United States and other parts of the world may make it more difficult for us to lease certain types of transportation assets that are either returned at the end of a lease term or returned as a result of a customer bankruptcy or default.\nAdverse changes in commodity prices or reduced demand for commodities could reduce customer demand for various types of assets in our fleet. A significant decrease in the price of a commodity may cause producers of that commodity to reduce their production levels. A significant increase in the price of a commodity could cause our customers to switch to less expensive transport alternatives. In either case, these changes in customer behavior can reduce demand for the portions of our fleet that are used to transport the commodity. In addition, demand for rail assets used to transport ethanol and other renewable fuels may be affected by government subsidies and mandates, which may be enacted, changed, or eliminated from time to time.\nThe availability and relative cost of alternative modes of transportation and changes in customer transportation preferences also could reduce demand for our rail assets. For example, technological innovations in the trucking industry and patterns in U.S. economic growth that favor truck over rail could result in a modal shift away from rail and reduce customer demand for our rail assets. Demand for our marine and aircraft spare engine assets and related services is also influenced by many of the factors discussed above. For example, aircraft spare engine leasing is influenced by airline and lessee profitability, reliability and durability of engine types, world trade policies, technological advances, and price and other competitive factors. A significant decline in customer demand for our assets and services could adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn many cases, demand for our assets also depends on our customers\u2019 desire to lease, rather than buy, the assets. Tax and accounting considerations, interest rates, and operational flexibility, among other factors, may influence a customer\u2019s decision to lease or buy assets. We have no control over these external considerations, and changes in these factors, including recent changes to lease accounting rules and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, could negatively impact demand for our assets held for lease.\nA significant change in pricing and/or service offerings by North American railroads or poor operating conditions could reduce demand for our rail assets and negatively impact financial performance.\nOur North American rail asset leasing business is impacted by the operations of the railroads, particularly the eight largest rail systems known as the \"Class I railroads\", most of which are pursuing some form of major operational transformation under the umbrella term of \"precision scheduled railroading\" or \"PSR\". If PSR results in substantial increases in train velocity or decreases in dwell time for rail assets, the resulting excess supply of railcars and/or locomotives may adversely impact the demand for our rail assets. Alternatively, if PSR results in increased pricing and/or reduced service frequency and quality, the value proposition of rail freight for shippers relative to alternative modes of transportation could be reduced. Apart from PSR, other factors such as adverse weather conditions, railroad mergers, and increases in rail traffic could result in slower transit times making rail transportation less attractive to shippers versus other modes of transport. Each of these cases could reduce demand for our rail assets and decreased fleet utilization due to modal shift away from rail, all of which could negatively impact revenue and our results of operations.\nA significant decrease in lease renewals of our transportation assets by our customers or a significant increase in the number of compliance-based maintenance events could negatively impact operations and substantially increase our costs.\nDecreases in customer demand for our transportation assets could increase the number of leases that are not renewed upon expiration, resulting in the return of such assets by our customers. Returned transportation assets often must undergo maintenance and service work before being leased to new customers. A significant increase in the number of leased assets requiring maintenance may negatively affect our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs.\nWe also perform a variety of government or industry-mandated maintenance programs on our fleet. These compliance programs are cyclical in nature, and as a result, we can face significant increases in the number of maintenance events in any given year. A significant increase in maintenance or severe constraints in the repair networks may negatively impact our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs. In addition, while we rely on third party maintenance providers to assist with these compliance procedures for our transportation assets, high demand faced by these providers from other asset owners may constrain our access to the providers or may substantially increase our costs.\nEvents that negatively affect certain assets, customers, or geographic regions could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe generally derive our revenues from a variety of asset types, customers, industries, and geographic locations. However, from time to time we could have a large investment in a particular asset type, a large revenue stream associated with a particular customer or industry, or a large number of customers located in a particular geographic region. Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a specific asset type, customer, industry, or region in which we have a concentrated exposure could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur long-term railcar purchase commitments could subject us to material operational and financial risks.\nUnlike some of our competitors in the railcar leasing market, we do not manufacture railcars. In order to obtain committed access to a supply of newly built railcars on competitive terms, we regularly enter into long-term supply agreements with manufacturers to purchase significant numbers of newly built railcars over a multi-year period. Some of these agreements may provide for flexibility in the pricing, timing, and quantity of our purchasing commitments, while other agreements may provide no such flexibility. Therefore, if economic conditions weaken during the term of a long-term supply agreement, it is possible that we may be required to continue to accept delivery of, and pay for, new railcars at times when it may be difficult for us to lease such railcars and our financing costs may be high, which could negatively affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, if tariffs, trade disputes, commodity prices, or other factors lead to higher prices for steel or other raw materials used to manufacture railcars, we may be required to pay higher prices to purchase new railcars, which could adversely affect our ability to profitably lease those railcars to customers.\nSoft market conditions and declines in asset values may reduce opportunities for us to generate remarketing income.\nWe utilize our extensive knowledge and experience to remarket transportation assets in order to optimize the composition of our fleets, and these activities generate income that contributes significantly to segment profit. Reduced demand for our assets due to adverse market conditions could reduce opportunities for us to generate remarketing income. A significant or prolonged decline in the secondary market for our assets could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe may not be able to successfully consummate and manage ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities, which could have an adverse impact on our financial statements.\nFrom time to time, we may acquire other businesses and, based on an evaluation of our business portfolio, divest existing businesses. These acquisitions and divestitures may present financial, managerial, and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, increased expenses and costs, assumption of liabilities and indemnities, and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers or third parties. In addition, we may be required to incur asset impairment charges (including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets) in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce our profitability. If we are unable to consummate such transactions, we will not receive the expected benefits, and alternative favorable opportunities to divest may not be available to us. If we cannot successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, or are unable to complete a divestiture, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe have significant financial exposure related to the performance of our aircraft engine leasing affiliate investments.\nGATX and Rolls-Royce plc. each own 50% of domestic and foreign joint venture entities (collectively, the \u201cRRPF affiliates\u201d) that own and lease aircraft spare engines to Rolls-Royce plc. and owners and operators of commercial aircraft. Rolls-Royce plc. is a major customer of the RRPF affiliates, as well as a critical supplier of aircraft spare engines and commercial, technical, and maintenance services to the RRPF affiliates. A deterioration in (1) the performance of such services by Rolls-Royce plc., (2) the durability and reliability of Rolls-Royce, plc. engines, or (3) the creditworthiness of Rolls-Royce plc., could negatively impact the financial performance of the RRPF affiliates.\nIn addition, as a 50% partner in the RRPF affiliates, we may not have control over operational matters, which could result in actions that have an adverse financial impact on the RRPF affiliates, and could expose us to potential liability. The RRPF affiliates contribute significantly to our financial results. If the financial or operating performance of the RRPF affiliates deteriorates, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected.\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates could negatively impact our results of operations.\nUpon consolidation, we translate the financial results of certain subsidiaries from their local currency to the U.S. dollar, which exposes us to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. As exchange rates vary, the translated operating results of foreign subsidiaries may differ materially from period to period. We also have gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, which could vary based on fluctuations in exchange rates and the timing of the transactions and their settlement. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can affect the demand and price for services we provide both domestically and internationally, and could negatively impact our results of operations. We also face risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates. We may seek to limit our exposure to foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk with currency or interest rate derivatives, which may or may not be effective. A material and unexpected change in interest rates or foreign exchange rates could negatively affect our financial performance.\nMany of our employees are represented by unions, and failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements may result in strikes, work stoppages, or substantially higher labor costs.\nA significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining agreements that cover a range of workplace matters, such as wages, health and welfare benefits, and work rules. If we fail to negotiate acceptable labor agreements, our business could be disrupted by strikes or lockouts. We could also incur increased operating costs due to higher wages or benefits paid to union workers. Business disruptions or higher operating costs could both have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe may incur future asset impairment charges.\nWe review long-lived assets and joint venture investments for impairment annually, or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or investment may not be recoverable. Among other circumstances, the following may change our estimates of the cash flows we expect our long-lived assets or joint venture investments will generate, which could require us to recognize asset impairment charges:\n\u2022\nA weak economic environment or challenging market conditions\n\u2022\nNew laws, rules or regulations affecting our assets, or changes to existing laws, rules or regulations\n\u2022\nEvents related to particular customers or asset types\n\u2022\nAsset or portfolio sale decisions by management.\nDeterioration of conditions in the global capital markets or negative changes in our credit ratings may limit our ability to obtain financing and may increase our borrowing costs.\nWe rely largely on banks and the capital markets to fund our operations and contractual commitments. Typical funding sources include commercial paper, bank term loans, public debt issuances, and a variety of other secured and unsecured financing structures. These markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be limited for an extended period of time. In addition to conditions in the capital markets, changes in our financial performance or credit ratings or ratings outlook, as determined by rating agencies such as Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s Investors Service, could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs or to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for secured and unsecured debt. If we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, our other sources of funds, including available cash, bank facilities, cash flow from operations, and portfolio proceeds, may not be adequate to fund our operations and contractual commitments.\nChanges in banks' inter-lending rate reporting practices or the phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nWe have a significant amount of borrowing arrangements and financing structures that are based on the London Inter-Bank Offering Rate (\"LIBOR\"), including at our RRPF affiliates. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced they would not require panel banks to continue submitting quotes for LIBOR after 2021. In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of a diverse set of private and public sector entities, has recommended replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"), a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether any such changes will occur, which alternative reference rates or other reforms to LIBOR could be enacted in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere, or the effect that any such changes, alternative reference rates or other reforms, if they occur, would have on the amount of interest paid on, or the market value of, our current or future debt obligations. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates, or other reforms may adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nCompetition could result in decreased profitability.\nWe operate in a highly competitive business environment. In certain cases, our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources, higher credit ratings, and a lower cost of capital. These factors may enable our competitors to offer leases or services to customers at lower rates than we can provide, thus negatively impacting our profitability, asset utilization, and investment volume.\nRisks related to our international operations and expansion into new geographic markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe generate a significant amount of our net income outside the United States. In recent years, we have increased our focus on international growth and expansion into select emerging markets as a means to grow and diversify earnings.\nOur foreign operations and international expansion strategy are subject to the following risks associated with international operations:\n\u2022\nNoncompliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\n\u2022\nNoncompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations\n\u2022\nFailure to properly implement changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws\n\u2022\nFailure to develop and maintain data management practices that comply with laws related to cybersecurity, privacy, data localization, and data protection\n\u2022\nFluctuations in currency values\n\u2022\nSudden changes in foreign currency exchange controls\n\u2022\nDiscriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies\n\u2022\nDifficulties enforcing contractual rights or foreclosing to obtain the return of our assets in certain jurisdictions\n\u2022\nInability to access railcar supply\n\u2022\nUncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles that may be more prevalent in foreign countries\n\u2022\nIneffective or delayed implementation of appropriate controls, policies, and processes across our diverse operations and employee base\n\u2022\nImposition of sanctions against countries where we operate or specific companies or individuals with whom we do business\n\u2022\nNationalization or confiscation of assets by foreign governments, and imposition of additional or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, and similar restrictions on our operations outside the United States\n\u2022\nUnforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics, and international tensions and conflicts.\nOur transportation assets and operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations. If these laws, rules, and regulations change or we fail to comply with them, it could have a significant negative effect on our business and profitability.\nOur fleets of transportation assets and related operations are subject to various U.S. and non-U.S. laws, rules, and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions where we do business. Such laws, rules, and regulations could be changed in ways that would require us to modify our business models and objectives, impose requirements for additional maintenance or substantial modification or refurbishment of our assets, or otherwise affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright. Violations of these laws, rules, and regulations can result in substantial fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeiture of assets.\nWe may not be able to obtain cost-effective insurance.\nWe manage our exposure to risk, in part, by purchasing insurance. There is no guarantee that cost-effective insurance will consistently be available. If insurance coverage becomes prohibitively expensive or unavailable, we could be forced to reduce our coverage amount and increase the amount of self-insured risk we retain, thereby increasing our exposure to uninsured adverse judgments and other losses and liabilities that could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulations and the costs of remediation may be material.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, foreign, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, some of our properties, including those previously owned or leased, have been used for industrial purposes, which may have resulted in discharges onto these properties. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties in addition to properties we currently own or use. Additionally, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, and costs arising out of third-party claims for property or natural resource damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations in connection with our or our lessees\u2019 current or historical operations. Under some environmental laws in the United States and certain other countries, the owner of a leased asset may be liable for environmental damage, cleanup or other costs in the event of a spill or discharge of material from such asset without regard to the owner's fault. Governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate, including environmental laws and regulations, without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects such changes may have on our business. Due to the regulatory complexities, risk of unidentified contaminants on our properties, and the potential liability for our operations as well as those of our lessees, it is possible environmental and remediation costs may be materially different from the costs we have estimated.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock at current levels.\nThe timing, amount and payment of future dividends to shareholders and repurchases of our common stock fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors (the \"Board\"). The Board\u2019s decisions regarding the payment of dividends and repurchase of shares depend on many factors such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase shares in the future, and our payment of dividends and repurchase of shares could vary from historical practices and our stated expectations.\nThe fair market value of our long-lived assets may differ from the value of those assets reflected in our financial statements.\nOur assets primarily consist of long-lived transportation assets such as rail assets, aircraft spare engines, and marine vessels. The carrying value of these assets on our financial statements may sometimes differ from their fair market value. These valuation differences may be positive or negative and could be material based on market conditions and demand for certain assets.\nOur assets may become obsolete.\nIn addition to changes in laws, rules, and regulations that may make transportation assets obsolete, changes in the preferred method our customers use to ship their products, changes in demand for particular products, or a shift by customers toward purchasing assets rather than leasing them may adversely impact us. Our customers' industries are driven by dynamic market forces and trends, which are influenced by economic and political factors. Changes in our customers' markets may significantly affect demand for our rail, aircraft spare engine, and marine assets.\nUnfavorable conditions on the Great Lakes could impact business operations of our American Steamship Company (\"ASC\") subsidiary, which could result in increases in costs and decreases in revenues.\nThe success of our ASC subsidiary depends on the efficiency of its marine operations on the Great Lakes. Disruptions at the Sault St. Marie locks or severe weather conditions, such as high wind and ice formation, could cause significant business interruptions or shortened sailing seasons. Additionally, low water levels and vessel draft restrictions may restrict the volume that ASC's vessels can transport per trip. These conditions could negatively impact our results of operations through increased operating costs or decreased revenues.\nWe may be affected by climate change or market or regulatory responses to climate change.\nThere is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions. Climate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. Severe weather, climate change, and natural disasters, such as tornadoes, flooding and earthquakes, could cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. Changes in laws, rules, and regulations, or actions by authorities or other third parties under existing laws, rules, or regulations, to address GHG and climate change could negatively impact our customers and business. For example, restrictions on GHG emissions could significantly increase costs for our customers whose production processes require significant amounts of energy, which could reduce demand for the lease of our assets, while rail assets in our fleet that are used to carry fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, could see reduced demand if government regulations mandate a reduction in fossil fuel consumption or customer preferences change. New government regulations could also increase our operating costs and compliance with those regulations could be costly. Any of these factors, individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change, could reduce the demand for our assets and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA small number of shareholders could significantly influence our business.\nSix shareholders collectively control more than 60% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, a small number of shareholders could affect matters that require shareholder approval, such as the election of directors and the approval of significant business transactions.\nChanges to assumptions used to calculate post-retirement costs, increases in funding requirements, and investment losses in pension funds could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe calculate our pension and other post-retirement costs using various assumptions, such as discount rates, long-term return on plan assets, salary increases, health care cost trend rates, and other factors. Changes to any of these assumptions could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Periods of low interest rates reduce the discount rate we use to calculate our funding obligations, which may increase our funding requirements. Additionally, changes to laws, regulations, or rules could require us to increase funding requirements or to compensate for investment losses in pension plan assets. If we were forced to increase contributions to our pension plans, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively affected.\nChanges in the mix of earnings in the U.S. and foreign countries could adversely affect our effective tax rate.\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in the United States and foreign countries with differing statutory tax rates. Our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, material audit assessments, or legislative changes that impact statutory tax rates, which could include an impact on previously-recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nOur allowance for losses may be inadequate.\nOur allowance for losses on reservable assets may not be adequate to cover credit losses in our portfolio if unexpected adverse changes occur in macroeconomic conditions or if discrete events adversely affect specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates, it may require us to incur additional credit losses and our financial position or results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nInflation or deflation could have an unanticipated adverse impact on our financial results.\nThe timing and duration of the effects of inflation are unpredictable and depend on market conditions and economic factors. Inflation in lease rates as well as inflation in residual values for rail and marine assets has historically benefited our financial results. However, these benefits may be offset by increases in the costs for goods and services we purchase, including salaries and wages, health care costs, supplies, utilities, maintenance and repair services, and materials, as well as increased financing costs. Significant increases in our cost of goods and services could adversely impact our financial performance. Conversely, a period of prolonged deflation could negatively impact our lease rate pricing, residual values, and asset remarketing opportunities. These negative impacts of deflation may be offset by decreases to our costs for goods and services, including those listed above.\nWe could be adversely affected by United States and global political conditions, including acts or threats of terrorism or war.\nWe may be adversely affected by national and international political developments, instability, and uncertainties, including political unrest and threats of terrorist attacks or war, which could lead to the following:\n\u2022\nLegislation or regulatory action directed toward improving the security of transportation assets against acts of terrorism, which could affect the construction or operation of transportation assets and increase costs\n\u2022\nA decrease in demand for transportation assets and services\n\u2022\nLower utilization of transportation equipment\n\u2022\nLower transportation asset lease and charter rates\n\u2022\nImpairments and loss of transportation assets\n\u2022\nCapital market disruption, which may raise our financing costs or limit our access to capital\n\u2022\nLiability or losses resulting from acts of terrorism involving our assets\n\u2022\nA significant deterioration of global growth, and related decreases in confidence or investment activity in the global markets, arising from political or economic tensions, changes, and trends and/or an increase in trade conflict and protectionism.\nDepending upon the severity, scope, and duration of these circumstances, the impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be material.\nWe rely on technology in all aspects of our business operations. If we are unable to adequately maintain and secure our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) infrastructure from cybersecurity threats and related disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted.\nThreats to IT systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks have continued to increase in recent years. We rely on our IT infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information that is used in all aspects of our business operations, including employee and customer information. All IT systems are vulnerable to security threats, such as hacking, viruses, malicious software, and other unlawful attempts to disrupt or gain access to these systems. The steps we have taken to mitigate these risks may not be effective to prevent breaches of our IT infrastructure, some of which is managed by third parties. Breaches of our IT infrastructure could lead to disruptions in our business, potentially including the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of confidential employee and customer information stored on our IT systems or confidential data or other business information and subject us to potential lawsuits or other material legal liabilities. These disruptions could adversely affect our operations, financial position, and results of operations.\nOur internal control over financial accounting and reporting may not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial accounting, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations. No system of internal control provides absolute assurance that the financial statements are accurate and free of material error.", "PERMNO": 12036, "SIC": 4700, "TIC": "GATX"}
