{"cik": "1349929", "company": "CANCER GENETICS, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-05-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nAn investment in the Company's common stock involves a high degree of risk including the risk of a loss of your entire investment. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information contained in this report and the other Company reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The risks set forth below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties may exist that could also adversely affect the Company's business, operations and financial condition. If any of the following risks actually materialize, the Company's business, financial condition and/or operations could suffer. In such event, the value of the Company's common stock could decline, and you could lose all or a substantial portion of the money that you pay for the Company's common stock.\nRisks Relating to the Company's Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nThe Company has a history of net losses; the Company expects to incur net losses in the future, and the Company may never achieve sustained profitability.\nThe Company has historically incurred substantial net losses. The Company incurred losses of $6.7 million and $20.4 million for fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. From the Company's inception in April 1999 through December 31, 2019, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $164.4 million. The Company expects losses to continue, only to the extent that the business does not outpace the public company-related expenses, such as legal and audit fees and director\u2019s and officer\u2019s liability insurance, and the potential for ongoing losses associated with operating the Discovery Services business. These losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on working capital, total assets and stockholders\u2019 equity. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the Company's revenue growth and costs associated with being a public company, the Company is unable to predict when the Company will become profitable, and the Company may never become profitable. Even if the Company does achieve profitability, the Company may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. The Company's inability to achieve and then maintain profitability would negatively affect business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company's recurring losses from operations have raised substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company's history of losses required management to assess its ability to continue operating as a going concern, according to ASC 205-40, Going Concern. Even after the Business Disposals, the Company does not project that cash at December 31, 2019 will be sufficient to fund normal operations for the twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on reduced losses and improved future cash flows. Alternatively, the Company may be required to raise additional equity or debt capital, or consummate other strategic transactions. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company can provide no assurance that these actions will be successful or that additional sources of financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company's ability to satisfy claims of all its creditors in full is uncertain.\nWhile in connection with the closing of the BioPharma Disposal, the SVB ABL and the PFG Term Note were terminated, and all related liens were released, the Company remains liable to various unsecured creditors, including in the amount of $100 thousand due to NovellusDx, Ltd. (\u201cNDX\u201d) as of the date of this Form 10-K, in connection with its October 2019 NDX Settlement Agreement, and the principal amount of $1.3 million, plus interest due to Atlas Sciences, LLC pursuant to its one-year October 2019 unsecured note. At December 31, 2019, other than those of discontinuing operations, the Company had an aggregate of $5.7 million of current liabilities and $6.3 million in total liabilities. This is compared to current assets other than those of discontinuing operations of $7.1 million, as of December 31, 2019. However, at December 31, 2019, the Company has an additional $1.2 million of liabilities associated with discontinuing operations that will be funded primarily from the Company's continuing operations. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to pay such unsecured creditors in full or that claims will not be asserted in addition to the amounts which the Company believes it is liable for at this time.\nThe Company\u2019s additional sources of funds are uncertain.\nThe Company has three sources of potential cash receipts following the Business Disposals, with only the third, the proceeds from the Discovery Business, being material. First, as part of the sale of the Clinical Business to siParadigm, the Company is receiving earn-out payments based on the revenues of siParadigm from the former customers of the Company\u2019s Clinical Services business. Such earn-out payments are based on revenues generated in the 12 months following the closing of the sale of the Clinical Services business, and are to be paid over 24 months following such sale. While the Company received net payments of approximately $156 thousand from siParadigm in the July through December 2019 period, the monthly payments from siParadigm have decreased since the end of the third quarter of 2019, and no assurances can be given with respect to the amount and timing of any further payments. Second, the Company is attempting to collect on certain accounts receivable it owns that were not sold to siParadigm or IDXG. The net amount of such accounts receivable expected to be collected as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $71 thousand.\nThird, the Company continues to own its Discovery Business through its vivoPharm subsidiary. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2019, the Company had a net loss from continuing operations of $6.9 million, had cash used in continuing operations of $3.2 million and $7.3 million in revenues from the Discovery Business. No assurances can be given as to whether the Company will ever be profitable, and there are substantial doubts about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. If the Company is not able to remediate the material weakness and otherwise maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of its financial reporting, investor confidence in the Company and the value of its common stock could be adversely affected.\nAs a public company, the Company is required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\"Section 404\"), requires that the Company evaluate and determine the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to controls over accounting for foreign currency exchange rate. As a result, a non-cash adjustment had to be recorded to correct the error identified during the 2019 audit procedures. In addition, the Company identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to controls over accounting for the fair value of an investment held by the Company. As a result, a non-cash adjustment had to be recorded to correct the error identified during the 2019 audit procedures. The Company has begun the process of implementing changes to its internal control over financial reporting to remediate the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material weakness, including further improvements in its processes and analyses that support the accounting for foreign currency exchanges. The Company expects this deficiency to be corrected by the end of the second quarter of 2020.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company identified a continued material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to controls over accounting for uncollectible Clinical Services revenue. This material weakness in the Company's revenue and cash receipts process continued in 2018 as remediation efforts were not adequate. As a result, additional amounts had to be recorded as bad debt expense for older balances. Based on a change in financial leadership in late November 2018, the Company has demonstrated a commitment to remediate the material weakness in a timely fashion. The Company had noted the need for additional corporate accounting and financial personnel, supplemented by external resources as appropriate, with the requisite skill and technical expertise. This deficiency was ultimately corrected by the disposal of the Clinical Business in July 2019.\nIf the Company's steps are insufficient to successfully remediate the material weaknesses and otherwise establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of its financial reporting, investor confidence in the Company and the value of its common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for the Company to provide reliable and timely financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to reasonably detect and prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause the Company to fail to meet its reporting obligations. For as long as the Company is a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under the U.S. securities laws, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting could detect problems that management\u2019s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting could lead to financial statement restatements and require the Company to incur the expense of remediation.\nMoreover, the Company does not expect that disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Failure of its control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s business operations are more limited than prior to the sale of its Clinical Services business and the sale of its BioPharma Services business, and thus the costs of maintaining itself as a publicly traded corporation are proportionally higher as a percentage of total revenue and will be more burdensome to the Company going forward.\nAs a public company, the Company has incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. The Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the other rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq. Compliance with the various reporting and other requirements applicable to public companies requires considerable time and attention of management. For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules of the SEC and national securities exchanges have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls. Management and other personnel are devoting and will continue to need to devote a substantial amount of time and money to these compliance obligations. The board may view these costs to be disproportionately expensive when viewed in light of the Company's reduced revenues and overall operations following the Business Disposals.\nAs a result, the board of directors may elect to pursue a strategic transaction to attempt to expand the business and create additional value for shareholders, or in light of the time, costs and uncertainties inherent in seeking such a strategic transaction, and the costs in remaining as a public company, the Company's board may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of the Company. If the Company's board of directors were to approve and recommend, and the Company's stockholders were to approve, a dissolution and liquidation of the Company, the Company would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay the Company's outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provision for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to the Company's stockholders. The Company's commitments and contingent liabilities may include severance obligations related to the recent asset sales. As a result of this requirement, a portion of the Company's assets may need to be reserved pending the resolution of such obligations. If a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, the board of directors, in consultation with its advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders of the Company's common stock could lose all or a significant portion of their investment in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company.\nManagement may have conflicts of interest.\nCurrent management of the Company, principally its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Company, including planning for the future direction of the Company after the Business Disposals. Such officers may enter into consulting agreements with Buyer (and, in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, siParadigm) and have been assisting in the transition of the Clinical Business and BioPharma Business to siParadigm and IDXG, as applicable. It is possible that the dual roles will create conflicts of interest for such officers with respect to allocation of their time and otherwise. No assurance can be given that the officers of the Company will have sufficient time and resources to properly direct the future operations of the Company, or that other conflicts of interest in their dual roles will not arise.\nRisks Relating to the Company's Business and Strategy\nIf the Company is unable to increase sales, the Company revenues will be insufficient to achieve profitability.\nThe Company currently derives substantially all revenues from testing services, laboratory services and CRO at the premarket stage. Discovery Services are services that include proprietary preclinical test systems supporting clinical diagnostic and prognostic offerings at early stages, supporting the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology companies and academic research centers. In particular, the Company's preclinical development of biomarker detection methods, response to immuno-oncology directed novel treatments and early prediction of clinical outcome is supported by the Company's extended portfolio of orthotopic, xenografts and syngeneic tumor test systems. It is unclear whether the Company will be able to maintain and grow the number of pharmaceutical and biotech companies and clinical research organizations who will avail themselves of the Company's services.\nIf the Company is unable to increase sales of tests and services, the Company will not produce sufficient revenues to become profitable.\nThe Company's business is subject to risks arising from epidemic diseases, such as the recent global outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus.\nThe recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic, has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A pandemic, including COVID-19 or other public health epidemic, poses the risk that the Company or its employees, contractors, suppliers, courier delivery services and other partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to spread of the disease within these groups or due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the impact that COVID-19 could have on the Company's business, the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on global economic conditions which could have an adverse effect on the Company's business and financial condition, including impairing the ability to raise capital when needed.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected could disrupt the supply chain of material needed for the Company's Discovery Services and could delay future projects from commencing due to COVID-19 related impacts on the demand for Company services and therefore have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Company's corporate and accounting functions are located in New Jersey and are currently subject to a shelter-in-place mandate. The Company's U.S. based preclinical laboratory is located in Pennsylvania and is subject to a stay-at-home order, and many customers worldwide are similarly impacted. As a healthcare provider, the Company is allowed to remain open in compliance with the shelter-in-place and stay-at-home mandates and continue to provide critical services in the development of new therapies and the fight against cancer. The Company is still providing Discovery Services, and has yet to experience a slowdown in project work as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the future of many projects may be delayed. The global outbreak of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve, and the extent to which COVID-19 may impact business, results of operations and financial position will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.\nIf pharmaceutical and biotech companies and clinical research organizations decide not to use the Company's preclinical CRO services in connection with their clinical trials, the Company may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain the Company's business.\nTo generate demand for the its Discovery Services, the Company needs to educate pharmaceutical and biotech companies and clinical research organizations on the utility of the Company's tests and services to improve the outcomes of clinical trials for new oncology drugs and more rapidly advance targeted therapies through the clinical development process through published papers, presentations at scientific conferences and one-on-one education sessions by members of the Company's sales force. The Company may need to hire additional commercial, scientific, technical and other personnel to support this process. If the Company cannot convince pharmaceutical and biotech companies or clinical research organizations to order its diagnostic tests or other future tests the Company develops, the Company will likely be unable to create demand for tests in sufficient volume for it to achieve sustained profitability.\nThe potential loss or delay of the Company's large contracts or of multiple contracts could adversely affect results.\nMost of the Company's Discovery Services customers can terminate the contracts upon 30 to 90 days\u2019 notice. These customers may delay, terminate or reduce the scope of the contracts for a variety of reasons beyond the Company's control, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndecisions to forego or terminate a particular clinical trial;\n\u2022\nlack of available financing, budgetary limits or changing priorities;\n\u2022\nfailure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements or efficacy criteria;\n\u2022\nunexpected or undesired clinical results for products; or\n\u2022\nshift of business to a competitor or internal resources.\nAs a result, contract terminations, delays and alterations are a possible outcome in the Company's Discovery Services business. In the event of termination, the contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project, but these fees may not be sufficient for the Company to maintain margins, and termination may result in lower resource utilization rates. In addition, the Company may not realize the full benefits of the backlog of contractually committed services if customers cancel, delay or reduce their commitments under the Company's contracts with them, which may occur if, among other things, a customer decides to shift its\nbusiness to a competitor or revoke the Company's status as a preferred provider. Thus, the loss or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could adversely affect Company revenues and profitability. The Company believes the risk of loss or delay of multiple contracts potentially has greater effect where the Company is party to broader partnering arrangements with global biopharmaceutical companies.\nThe Company's quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations and may be difficult to forecast.\nThe timing, size and duration of the Company's contracts with pharmaceutical and biotech companies and clinical research organizations depend on the size, pace and duration of such customer\u2019s clinical trial, over which the Company has no control and sometimes limited visibility. In addition, expense levels are based, in part, on expectation of future revenue levels. A shortfall in expected revenue could, therefore, result in a disproportionate decrease in the Company's net income. As a result, quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations and may be difficult to forecast.\nIf the market for the Company's services does not experience significant growth or if services do not achieve broad acceptance, operations will suffer.\nThe Company cannot accurately predict the future growth rate or the size of the market for the Company's services. The expansion of this market depends on a number of factors, such as:\n\u2022\nthe cost, performance and reliability of the Company's services, and the services offered by competitors;\n\u2022\ncustomers' perceptions regarding the benefits of the Company's services;\n\u2022\ncustomers' satisfaction with the Company's services; and\n\u2022\nmarketing efforts and publicity regarding the Company's services.\nThe Company's financial results may be adversely affected if it underprices contracts, overruns cost estimates or fails to receive approval for or experience delays in documenting change orders.\nMost of the Discovery Services contracts are either fee for service contracts or fixed-fee contracts. The Company's past financial results have been, and future financial results may be, adversely impacted if the Company initially underprices contracts or otherwise overrun cost estimates and is unable to successfully negotiate a change order. Change orders can occur when the scope of work the Company performs needs to be modified from that originally contemplated by the contract with the customer and are typically treated as new projects. Modifications can occur, for example, when there is a change in a key clinical trial assumption or parameter or a significant change in timing. Where the Company is not successful in converting out-of-scope work into change orders under current contracts, the Company bears the cost of the additional work. Such underpricing, significant cost overruns or delay in documentation of change orders could have a material adverse effect on business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nIf the Company fails to perform the services in accordance with contractual requirements, regulatory standards and ethical considerations, the Company could be subject to significant costs or liability and the Company's reputation could be harmed.\nIn connection with the Discovery Services business, the Company contracts with biopharmaceutical companies to provide specialized services to assist them in planning and conducting unique, specialized studies to guide drug discovery and development programs with a concentration in oncology and immuno-oncology. The Company's services include monitoring clinical trials, data and laboratory analysis, electronic data capture and other related services. Such services are complex and subject to contractual requirements, regulatory standards and ethical considerations. If the Company fails to perform the services in accordance with these requirements, regulatory agencies may take action against the Company for failure to comply with applicable regulations governing clinical trials. Customers may also bring claims against the Company for breach of contractual obligations. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nSuch consequences could arise if, among other things, the following occur:\nImproper performance of the Company's services. The performance of clinical development services is complex and time-consuming. For example, the Company may make mistakes in conducting a clinical trial that could negatively impact or obviate the usefulness of the clinical trial or cause the results of the clinical trial to be reported improperly. If the clinical trial results are compromised, the Company could be subject to significant costs or liability, which could have an adverse impact on the ability to perform services. As examples:\n\u2022\nnon-compliance generally could result in the termination of ongoing clinical trials or sales and marketing projects or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ncompromise of data from a particular clinical trial, such as failure to verify that informed consent was obtained from patients, could require the Company to repeat the clinical trial under the terms of the contract at no further cost to the customer, but at a substantial cost to the Company; and\n\u2022\nbreach of a contractual term could result in liability for damages or termination of the contract.\nWhile the Company endeavors to contractually limit exposure to such risks, improper performance of the Company's services could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, damage reputation and result in the cancellation of current contracts by or failure to obtain future contracts from the affected customer or other customers.\nInvestigation of customers. From time to time, one or more of the Company's customers are audited or investigated by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies with respect to regulatory compliance of their clinical trials, programs or the marketing and sale of their drugs. There is a risk that either the Company's customers or regulatory authorities could claim that the Company performed services improperly or that the Company is responsible for clinical trial or program compliance. If the Company's customers or regulatory authorities make such claims against the Company and prove them, the Company could be subject to damages, fines or penalties. In addition, negative publicity regarding regulatory compliance of customers\u2019 clinical trials, programs or drugs could have an adverse effect on the Company's business and reputation.\nBusiness or economic disruptions or global health concerns could seriously harm the Company's development efforts and increase costs and expenses.\nBroad-based business or economic disruptions could adversely affect the Company's business and ongoing or planned research and development activities of customers. For example, in December 2019 an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the United States. To date, this outbreak has already resulted in extended shutdowns of certain businesses in the Wuhan region and has had ripple effects to businesses around the world. Global health concerns, such as coronavirus, could also result in social, economic, and labor instability in the countries in which the Company or Company customers operate. The Company cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, but if the Company or any of its customers, suppliers, regulators and other third parties with whom the Company conducts business, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, the ability to conduct business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively impacted. It is also possible that global health concerns such as this one could disproportionately impact the healthcare-related facilities in which Company customers conduct studies, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operation and financial condition.\nIf the Company is unable to manage growth in business, prospects may be limited and the Company's future results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company intends to continue with sales and marketing programs and other activities as needed to meet future demand. Any significant expansion may strain managerial, financial and other resources. If the Company is unable to manage such growth, business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Company will need to improve continually the operations, financial and other internal systems to manage growth effectively, and any failure to do so may lead to inefficiencies and redundancies, and result in reduced growth prospects and diminished operational results.\nThe Company may acquire other businesses or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm operating results, dilute its stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase debt or cause the Company to incur significant expense.\nAs part of the Company's business strategy, the Company may pursue other mergers or acquisitions of businesses and assets. For example, the Company acquired vivoPharm in 2017, Response Genetics, Inc. in 2015 and Gentris Corporation in 2014, and entered into a joint venture in May 2013 with Mayo Foundation for Education and Research. The Company subsequently shut down Response Genetics operations in California and moved them to New Jersey and North Carolina and in February 2020 completed the commitments thereby ending the need for the Company's joint venture with Mayo. The Company also purchased a business in India in August 2014 which was sold in April 2018. The Company also sold the Clinical Business and BioPharma Business in two transactions in July 2019 (the \u201cBusiness Disposals\u201d). The Company has developed experience with acquiring other companies and forming strategic alliances and joint ventures. The Company may not be able to find suitable partners or merger or acquisition candidates, and may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms, if at all. If the Company makes any acquisitions,\nthe Company may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into existing business, and could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. Any future acquisitions also could result in significant write-offs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Integration of an acquired company also may disrupt ongoing operations and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing existing business. The Company may experience losses related to investments in other companies, which could have a material negative effect on the results of operations. The Company may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license, strategic alliance or joint venture.\nTo finance any mergers or acquisitions, the Company may choose to issue shares of common stock as consideration, which would dilute the ownership of its stockholders. If the price of the Company's common stock is low or volatile, the Company may not be able to acquire other companies using stock as consideration. Alternatively, it may be necessary for the Company to raise additional funds for acquisitions through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to the Company, or at all.\nThere is a scarcity of experienced professionals in the Company's industry. If the Company is not able to retain and recruit personnel with the requisite technical skills, the Company may be unable to successfully execute the business strategy.\nThe specialized nature of the Company's industry results in an inherent scarcity of experienced personnel in the field. The Company's future success depends upon the ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel (including medical, scientific, technical, commercial, business, regulatory and administrative personnel) necessary to support anticipated growth, develop business and perform certain contractual obligations. Given the scarcity of professionals with the scientific knowledge that the Company requires and the competition for qualified personnel among life science businesses, the Company may not succeed in attracting or retaining the personnel required to continue and grow operations. The loss of a key employee, the failure of a key employee to perform in his or her current position or the Company's inability to attract and retain skilled employees could result in the inability to continue to grow the Company's business or to implement business strategy.\nThe loss or transition of any member of the Company's senior management team or the inability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists, clinicians, and salespeople could adversely affect Company business.\nThe Company's success depends on the skills, experience, and performance of key members of the senior management team. The individual and collective efforts of these employees will be important as the Company continues to develop tests and services, and as the Company expands commercial activities. The loss or incapacity of existing members of the senior management team could adversely affect operations if the Company experiences difficulties in hiring qualified successors.\nThe complexity inherent in integrating a new key member of the senior management team with existing senior management may limit the effectiveness of any such successor or otherwise adversely affect the Company's business. Leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or a disruption to business or may increase the likelihood of turnover of other key officers and employees. Specifically, a leadership transition in the commercial team may cause uncertainty about or a disruption to the Company's commercial organization, which may impact the ability to achieve sales and revenue targets.\nThe Company's inability to attract, hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales professionals would hamper the ability to increase demand for the Company's services and to expand geographically.\nThe Company's success in selling Discovery Services could require the Company to expand the sales force in the United States and internationally by recruiting additional sales representatives with extensive experience in the Company's field. To achieve the Company's marketing and sales goals, the Company will need to continue to expand sales and commercial infrastructure. Sales professionals with the necessary technical and business qualifications are in high demand, and there is a risk that the Company may be unable to attract, hire and retain the number of sales professionals with the right qualifications, scientific backgrounds and relationships with decision-makers at potential customers needed to achieve sales goals. The Company may face competition from other companies in the industry, some of whom are much larger than the Company and who can pay greater compensation and benefits than the Company can, in seeking to attract and retain qualified sales and marketing employees. If the Company is unable to hire and retain qualified sales and marketing personnel, business will suffer.\nIf the Company's laboratory facilities become damaged or inoperable, or the Company is required to vacate any facility, the ability to provide services may be jeopardized.\nThe Company currently derives substantially all revenues from preclinical services. The Company's facilities and equipment could be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including fire, flooding and power outages, which may render\nit difficult or impossible for the Company to perform tests or provide laboratory services for some period of time. The inability to perform services or the backlog of projects that could develop if any of the Company's facilities is inoperable for even a short period of time may result in the loss of customers or harm to the Company's reputation or relationships with key researchers, collaborators, and customers, and the Company may be unable to regain those customers or repair the Company's reputation in the future. Furthermore, the Company's facilities and the equipment used to perform research and development work could be costly and time-consuming to repair or replace.\nIf the Company cannot compete successfully with competitors, the Company may be unable to increase or sustain revenues or achieve and sustain profitability.\nThe Company faces competition from companies that offer or are developing animal models for tumors and that have capabilities in toxicology and pharmacology testing. The competitors in the Company's Discovery Services business include Covance, Champions Oncology, Crown BioScience (recently acquired by JSR Life Sciences), Eurofins Scientific, Charles River, Jackson Labs and Explora Biolabs.\nThe Company's competitors may succeed in selling their products to pharmaceutical and biotech customers more effectively than the Company sells products. In addition, academic institutions, hospitals, governmental agencies, and other public and private research organizations also may conduct similar research, seek patent protection, and may develop and commercially introduce competing products or technologies on their own or through joint ventures. If one or more of the Company's competitors succeeds in developing similar technologies and products that are more effective or successful than any of those that the Company currently sells or will develop, results of operations will be significantly adversely affected.\nA small number of customers account for most of the sales of the Company's services. If any of these customers require fewer services from the Company for any reason, revenues could decline.\nDue to the early stage nature of the Company's business and the limited sales and marketing activities to date, the Company has historically derived a significant portion of revenue from a limited number of customers, although the customers that generate a significant portion of Company revenue may change from period to period. The Company's customers are largely pharmaceutical and biotech companies as part of a clinical trial. During the year ended December 31, 2019, three customers accounted for approximately 61% of the Company's consolidated revenue from continuing operations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, three customers accounted for approximately 53% of the Company's consolidated revenue from continuing operations. As a healthcare provider, the Company is still providing Discovery Services and has yet to experience a slowdown in its project work; however, the future of many projects may be delayed. The Company continues to vigilantly monitor the situation with its primary focus on the health and safety of its employees and clients.\nIf the Company uses biological and hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury, the Company could be liable for damages.\nThe Company's activities currently require the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials and hazardous materials and chemicals. The Company cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, the Company could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed the Company's resources or any applicable insurance coverage the Company may have. Additionally, the Company is subject to, on an ongoing basis, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant and could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the event of an accident or if the Company otherwise fails to comply with applicable regulations, the Company could lose permits or approvals or be held liable for damages or penalized with fines.\nThe Company's Discovery Services customers face intense competition from lower cost generic products, which may lower the amount that they spend on the Company's services.\nThe Company's Discovery Services customers face increasing competition from lower cost generic products, which in turn may affect their ability to pursue research and development activities with the Company. In the United States, EU and Japan, political pressure to reduce spending on prescription drugs has led to legislation and other measures which encourages the use of generic products. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time in the United States and other countries for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs. Loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes, reducing customers\u2019 sales of that product and their overall profitability. Availability of generic substitutes for the Company's customers\u2019 drugs may adversely affect their results of operations and cash flow, which in turn may mean that they would not have surplus capital to invest in research and development and drug commercialization, including in the Company's\nservices. If competition from generic products impacts customers\u2019 finances such that they decide to curtail the Company's services, revenues may decline and this could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.\nThe Company depends on information technology and telecommunications systems, and any failure of these systems could harm the Company's business.\nThe Company depends on information technology and telecommunications systems for significant aspects of operations. These information technology and telecommunications systems support a variety of functions, including test processing, sample tracking, quality control, customer service and support, billing, and general and administrative activities. Information technology and telecommunications systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of the Company's servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Any disruption or loss of information technology or telecommunications systems on which critical aspects of the Company's operations depend could have an adverse effect on business.\nThe Company's results of operations may be adversely affected if the Company fails to realize the full value of goodwill and intangible assets.\nThe Company assesses the realizable condition of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill annually and conducts an interim evaluation whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset, indicate that these assets may be impaired. The Company's ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of the businesses the Company has acquired, which in turn depend in part on how well the Company has integrated these businesses into the Company's own business. If the Company is not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized goodwill impairment of $2.9 million after considering the effects of the Business Disposals and declines in stock price. Such impairment charges could materially and adversely affect the Company's operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company's operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, with which compliance may be costly.\nThe Company's business is subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, worker health and safety and the use, management, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions. In addition, environmental laws and regulations could require the Company to pay for environmental remediation and response costs, or subject the Company to third party claims for personal injury, natural resource or property damage, relating to environmental contamination. Liability may be imposed whether or not the Company knew of, or were responsible for, such environmental contamination. The cost of defending against environmental claims, of compliance with environmental, health and safety regulatory requirements or of remediating contamination could materially adversely affect the Company's business, assets or results of operations.\nIntellectual Property Risks Relating to the Company's Business\nThe Company's rights to use technologies licensed from third parties are not within the Company's control, and the Company may not be able to sell products if the Company loses existing rights or cannot obtain new rights on reasonable terms.\nThe Company's ability to market certain of services, domestically and/or internationally, is in part derived from licenses to intellectual property which is owned by third parties. As such, the Company may not be able to continue selling services if the Company loses existing licensed rights or sell new services if the Company cannot obtain such licensed rights on reasonable terms. As may be expected, the Company's business may suffer if (i) these licenses terminate; (ii) if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license, properly maintain the licensed intellectual property or fail to prevent infringement of such intellectual property by third parties; (iii) if the licensed patents or other intellectual property rights are found to be invalid or (iv) if the Company is unable to enter into necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all. In return for the use of a third-party\u2019s technology, the Company may agree to pay the licensor royalties based on sales of products as well as other fees. Such royalties and fees are a component of cost of product revenues and will impact the margins on the Company's tests.\nIf the Company is unable to maintain intellectual property protection, competitive position could be harmed.\nThe Company's ability to protect proprietary discoveries and technologies affects the Company's ability to compete and to achieve sustained profitability. Currently, the Company relies on a combination of copyrights, trademarks and trademark applications,\nconfidentiality or non-disclosure agreements, material transfer agreements, licenses, work-for-hire agreements and invention assignment agreements to protect intellectual property rights. The Company also maintains as trade secrets certain company know-how and technological innovations designed to provide the Company with a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Currently, including both U.S. and foreign patent applications, the Company has only two issued U.S. patents and twelve pending patent applications relating to various aspects of the Company's technology. While the Company does not currently intend to pursue additional patent applications, it is possible that pending patent applications and any future applications may not result in issued patents. Even if patents are issued, third parties may independently develop similar or competing technology that avoids the Company's patents. Further, the Company cannot be certain that the steps that have been taken will prevent the misappropriation of the Company's trade secrets and other confidential information and technology, particularly in foreign countries where the Company does not have intellectual property rights.\nThe Company may become involved in lawsuits or other proceedings to protect or enforce patents or other intellectual property rights, which could be time-consuming and costly to defend, and could result in loss of significant rights and the assessment of treble damages.\nFrom time to time the Company may face intellectual property infringement (or misappropriation) claims from third parties. Some of these claims may lead to litigation. The outcome of any such litigation can never be guaranteed, and an adverse outcome could affect the Company negatively. For example, were a third-party to succeed on an infringement claim against the Company, the Company may be required to pay substantial damages (including up to treble damages if such infringement were found to be willful). In addition, the Company could face an injunction, barring the Company from conducting the allegedly infringing activity. The outcome of the litigation could require the Company to enter into a license agreement which may not be pursuant to acceptable or commercially reasonable or practical terms or which may not be available at all. It is also possible that an adverse finding of infringement against the Company may require the Company to dedicate substantial resources and time in developing non-infringing alternatives, which may or may not be possible. In the case of diagnostic tests, the Company would also need to include non-infringing technologies which would require the Company to re-validate tests. Any such re-validation, in addition to being costly and time consuming, may be unsuccessful.\nFurthermore, the Company may initiate claims to assert or defend intellectual property against third parties. Any intellectual property litigation, irrespective of whether the Company is the plaintiff or the defendant, and regardless of the outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, and could divert management\u2019s attention from the Company's business and negatively affect operating results or financial condition. The Company may not be able to prevent, alone or with third-party collaborators or suppliers, misappropriation of the Company's proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. In addition, interference proceedings brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to patents and patent applications or those of the Company's current or future collaborators, suppliers or customers.\nFinally, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of the Company's confidential and proprietary information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the Company's financial condition.\nRisks Relating to the Company's International Operations\nInternational expansion of the Company's business exposes the Company to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nThe Company's business strategy incorporates international expansion, including recent acquisitions which have provided facilities in Australia, and the possibility of establishing and maintaining other locations outside of the United States and expanding relationships with biopharmaceutical, academic and governmental research organizations. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nmultiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax and transfer pricing laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u2022\nbeing subject to additional privacy and cybersecurity laws, including the Australian Privacy Act of 1988;\n\u2022\nfailure by the Company or distributors to obtain regulatory approvals for the sale or use of tests in various countries, including failure to achieve \u201cCE Marking\u201d, a conformity mark which is required to market in vitro diagnostic medical devices in the European Economic Area and which is broadly accepted in other international markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nfinancial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions; and\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions, by maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors\u2019 activities.\nAny of these risks, if encountered, could significantly harm future international expansion and operations and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company's operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on the deployment of cash across global operations.\nAlthough the Company reports operating results in U.S. dollars, a portion of the Company's revenues and expenses are or will be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, particularly in Australia and Europe. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on the Company. Because the Company's consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the Company must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect revenues, income from operations, other income (expense), net and the value of balance sheet items originally denominated in other currencies. There is no guarantee that the Company's financial results will not be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, in some countries the Company could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which could limit the Company's ability to use these funds across its global operations.\nThe Company could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nThe FCPA and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. The Company's policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties, including criminal and civil fines, potential loss of export licenses, possible suspension of the ability to do business with the federal government, denial of government reimbursement for products and exclusion from participation in government health care programs. The Company may operate in jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with certain local customs and practices. The Company cannot assure that the internal control policies and procedures always will protect the Company from reckless or other inappropriate acts committed by affiliates, employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to the Company's Common Stock\nThe price of the Company's common stock has been and could remain volatile, and the market price of common stock may decrease.\nThe market price of the Company's common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. From January 2015 through March 27, 2020, the market price of the Company's common stock has fluctuated from a high of $382.50 per share in the third quarter of 2015, to a low of $2.00 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Market prices for securities of development-stage life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. The factors that may cause the market price of the Company's common stock to fluctuate include, but are not limited\n\u2022\nprogress, or lack of progress, in developing and commercializing the Company's proprietary tests;\n\u2022\nthe Company's ability to recruit and retain qualified regulatory and research and development personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in the relationship with key collaborators, suppliers, customers and third parties;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuation or earnings of competitors or companies viewed as similar to the Company;\n\u2022\nchanges in key personnel;\n\u2022\ndepth of the trading market in the Company's common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in the Company's capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nthe granting or exercise of employee stock options or other equity awards;\n\u2022\nrealization of any of the risks described under this section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the equity markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the securities of newly public companies for a number of reasons, including reasons that may be unrelated to business or operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may result in a material decline in the market price of the Company's common stock and you may not be able to sell your shares at prices you deem acceptable. In the past, following periods of volatility in the equity markets, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against public companies. Such litigation, if instituted against the Company, could result in substantial cost and the diversion of management attention.\nReports published by securities or industry analysts, including projections in those reports that exceed actual results, could adversely affect the Company's common stock price and trading volume.\nSecurities research analysts establish and publish their own periodic projections for the Company's business. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results the Company actually achieves. The Company's stock price may decline if the actual results do not match securities research analysts\u2019 projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who writes reports on the Company downgrades the Company's stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about the Company's business, stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the Company or fails to publish reports on the Company regularly, the Company's stock price or trading volume could decline. While the Company expects securities research analyst coverage, if no securities or industry analysts begin to cover the Company, the trading price for the Company's stock and the trading volume could be adversely affected.\nThe Company is incurring significant costs and devotes substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company.\nAs a public company, the Company is incurring significant legal, accounting and other expenses. For example, in addition to being required to comply with certain requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company is required to comply with certain requirements of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. The Company expects that compliance with these requirements will continue to increase legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, the Company expects that management and other personnel will continue to need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that the Company maintains effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, the Company must perform system and process evaluation and testing of internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, if the Company loses status as a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d the Company will be required to have the Company's independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Company's compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as applicable, requires the Company to incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. The Company currently does not have an internal audit group, and the Company will need to continue to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. If the Company or the independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of the Company's stock could decline and the Company could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nThe Company's ability to successfully implement the Company's business plan and maintain compliance with Section 404, as applicable, requires the Company to be able to prepare timely and accurate financial statements. The Company expects that the Company will need to continue to improve existing, and implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls\nto manage the Company's business effectively. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, may cause operations to suffer and the Company may be unable to conclude that internal control over financial reporting is effective and to obtain an unqualified report on internal controls from the Company's auditors as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If the Company fails to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the Company may not be able to accurately report financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in the Company's financial reporting. This, in turn, could have an adverse impact on trading prices for the Company's common stock, and could adversely affect the Company's ability to access the capital markets.\nAnti-takeover provisions of the Company's certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make an acquisition of the Company, which may be beneficial to the Company's stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by the Company's stockholders to replace or remove the current members of the board and management.\nCertain provisions of the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. Furthermore, these provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by the Company's stockholders to replace or remove members of the board of directors. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Company's common stock, thereby depressing the market price of the Company's common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. These provisions, among other things:\n\u2022\nauthorize the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock, the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the board of directors and that, if issued, could operate as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that the board of directors does not approve;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to the board of directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nlimit who may call a stockholder meeting.\nIn addition, the Company is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, which may, unless certain criteria are met, prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of the voting rights on the Company's common stock, from merging or combining with the Company for a prescribed period of time.\nBecause the Company does not expect to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future, you must rely on appreciation of the Company's common stock price for any return on your investment. Even if the Company changes that policy, the Company may be restricted from paying dividends on the Company's common stock.\nThe Company does not intend to pay cash dividends on shares of common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial performance, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors the board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, you will have to rely on capital appreciation, if any, to earn a return on your investment in the Company's common stock. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase the Company's common stock.", "PERMNO": 14094, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "CGIX"}
