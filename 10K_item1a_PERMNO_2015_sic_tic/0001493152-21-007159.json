{"cik": "1076682", "company": "POLARITYTE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business and operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties as described below. However, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we may currently deem immaterial, may become important factors that could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If any of the following risks occur, our financial condition or results of operations could suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe have a history of losses and may incur additional losses in the future.\nOn a cumulative basis we have sustained substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations since we embarked on our regenerative tissue product business at the beginning of 2017. As of December 31, 2020, our accumulated deficit was $478.2 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had $25.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, and working capital of approximately $22.7 million. In January 2021, we raised an additional $17.7 million in gross proceeds before offering expenses in a registered direct offering and through a warrant exercise agreement. In fiscal year 2020, we incurred losses of $42.9 million and we experienced negative cash flows from operations of $37.8 million. We expect to continue incurring material general and administrative expenses in connection with our operations, including the costs associated with preparing and filing our IND and BLA for SkinTE and beginning clinical trials as part of those applications. As a result, we anticipate that we will incur losses in the future.\nWe will need additional funding in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and, if available, may result in dilution to our stockholders. If we are unable to successfully raise additional capital, our future clinical trials and product development could be limited, and our long-term viability may be threatened.\nIn 2020 our net revenues from product sales and services contributed $10.1 million to defray cost of sales and total operating costs and expenses in the amount of $56.1 million. Our net revenues reduce the rate at which we burn our capital resources in the pursuit of our IND and BLA for SkinTE, but we have no expectation that product sales and services will be a major contributor to the capital resources we will need to advance SkinTE through the FDA regulatory process over the next several years.\nBased on currently available information as of the date we file this report, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our activities through the end of 2021 and into the third quarter of 2022. However, our projections of future cash needs may differ from actual results. Furthermore, finite resources may inhibit our ability to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital needs, or may force us to reduce operating expenses, which would significantly harm our business. We will need to seek additional working capital, which may be through sales of our equity securities or through bank credit facilities or public or private debt from various financial institutions or through future arrangements with strategic partners. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do identify sources for additional funding, the sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt could result in dilution to our stockholders. Additionally, the sale of equity securities or issuance of debt securities may be subject to certain security holder approvals under applicable Nasdaq rules or may result in the downward adjustment of the exercise or conversion price of our outstanding securities. We can give no assurance that sources of funding, such as sales of equity or debt, or strategic relationships would be available or would be approved by our security holders, if needed, on favorable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain additional working capital as and when needed, such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe plan to devote a majority of our financial and human resources to pursue an IND and BLA for SkinTE, which means we may fail to capitalize on product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited resources, we plan to forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for indications that later could prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs for product candidates may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate, or we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate for which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement.\nOur wholly owned subsidiary accepted a loan under the CARES Act pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), and the loan may not be forgiven or may subject us to challenges, audits, or investigations regarding qualification for the loan, any of which could reduce our liquidity and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn April 12, 2020, our subsidiary PolarityTE MD, Inc. (the \u201cBorrower\u201d) entered into a promissory note offered by a bank (the \u201cLender\u201d) evidencing an unsecured loan in the amount of $3,576,145 made to the Borrower under the PPP (the \u201cLoan\u201d). The PPP was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the \u201cSBA\u201d). The interest rate on the Loan is 1.00%. Beginning seven months from the date of the Loan the Borrower is required to make 24 monthly payments of principal and interest in the amount of $150,563. The promissory note evidencing the Loan contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, making materially false and misleading representations to the SBA or Lender, or breaching the terms of the Loan documents. The occurrence of an event of default may result in the repayment of all amounts outstanding, collection of all amounts owing from the Borrower, or filing suit and obtaining judgment against the Borrower. Under the terms of the CARES Act, PPP loan recipients can apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of a loan granted under the PPP.\nOn October 15, 2020, the Borrower applied to the Lender for forgiveness of the Loan in its entirety based on the Borrower\u2019s use of the PPP loan for payroll costs, rent, and utilities. On October 26, 2020, the Borrower was advised that the Lender approved the application and that the Lender was submitting the application to the SBA for a final decision. The Company classified the principal balance of the PPP loan within \u201cCurrent portion of long-term notes payable\u201d and \u201cLong-term notes payable\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. If the Borrower\u2019s application for forgiveness of the PPP loan is not approved or approved only in part, it will be obligated to repay the unforgiven portion of the loan after the SBA makes its decision on the application for forgiveness, in which case our liquidity could be reduced and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nPursuant to the requirements under the CARES Act, in connection with the Loan, the Borrower certified that current economic uncertainty makes the Loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the Borrower. We believe that the Borrower made such certification in a manner consistent with SBA guidance that borrowers must make the certification in good faith, taking into account their current business activity and their ability to access other sources of liquidity sufficient to support their ongoing operations in a manner that is not significantly detrimental to the business. While we believe any certification by the Borrower\u2019s certification was supported in light of the understandings of the requirements and the assessment made on the certification date, we cannot be certain that SBA or any other governmental entity or third party will concur with the Borrower, especially in light of the press scrutiny and SBA\u2019s evolving guidance and views, our change in strategy triggered, in part, on regulatory developments occurring after the Loan was made, and the eventual extent of the impact of current economic uncertainties on Borrower\u2019s operations.\nSubsequent to the Borrower\u2019s application for the loan, SBA issued various interpretive guidelines in connection with the PPP, including guidance on how SBA interprets certain of the certification requirements. One of the interpretations appears to be in response to various press reports that well-established or well capitalized private and public companies were able to secure PPP loans that were meant for smaller companies. SBA\u2019s interpretive guidelines published on April 23, 2020, set forth that public companies with substantial market value and access to capital markets would likely not qualify to participate in the PPP and SBA advised any such public company to be prepared to provide the basis for the certifications upon SBA request. Subsequently, on April 28, 2020 the Secretary of the Treasury and SBA announced that the government will conduct a full audit of all PPP loans of more than $2 million for which the borrower applies for forgiveness. Consistent with that announcement the SBA established an audit procedure for obtaining additional information from PPP borrowers regarding the loan application certification and use of PPP loan proceeds. The Borrower completed and submitted the additional information in December 2020 and plans to continue to provide information to SBA in support of the Borrower\u2019s original Loan application and use of Loan proceeds. The Borrower has yet to receive any response from the SBA. There is no assurance the SBA will conclude the Borrower properly applied for, and used the proceeds of, the Loan. If there is any adverse finding in the SBA audit or if the Borrower were alleged, or determined, not to qualify for the Loan or alleged, or found, to have made false certifications in connection with the Loan, the Borrower could be required to return the full amount of the Loan, which would reduce its liquidity, and could subject it to fines and penalties, and exclusion from government contracts. In particular, the Borrower may become subject to actions under the FCA, including its qui tam provisions, which, among other things, prohibits persons from knowingly filing, or knowingly causing to be filed, a false statement, or knowingly using a false statement, to obtain payment from the federal government. Violations of the FCA are subject to treble damages and penalties. In the case of an SBA loan, the government could allege that single damages are the amount of the loan and interest thereon (or more), which under the FCA could then be trebled. Substantial penalties must also be imposed for each submitted false statement when a defendant loses an FCA trial. FCA cases may be initiated by the U.S. Department of Justice or by private persons or entities, often called \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d who bring the action on behalf of the United States. The Borrower may also face enforcement arising under other federal statutes, including criminal laws, and administrative actions and investigations initiated by SBA or other governmental entities. Furthermore, if the Borrower is identified as an entity that the media, government officials, or others seek to portray as a business that should not have availed itself of PPP funding, the Borrower may face negative publicity, which could have a materially adverse impact on its business and operations and on our business and operations as its parent. Generally, the cost of defending claims under the FCA, regardless of merit, could be substantial, even as much as the PPP loan proceeds, so the Borrower may evaluate voluntarily repaying the loan on the basis of future circumstances to avoid these costs as well as the significant drain on management resources that accompanies litigation.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited, which could adversely affect future cash flows.\nWe have incurred net losses over the past several years, and we may never achieve or sustain profitability. Generally, losses incurred will carry forward until such losses expire or are used to offset future taxable income, if any. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cInternal Revenue Code\u201d), if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 or 383 has occurred, or whether there have been multiple ownership changes in the past. We may have experienced ownership changes in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership (some of which shifts are outside our control). As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset such taxable income could be subject to limitations. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. As a result, even if we attain profitability, we may be unable to use a material portion of our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our future cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Research & Development, Clinical, and Commercialization Activities\nWe are pursuing an IND and BLA for SkinTE, so we are an early-stage biotechnology company subject to the risks associated with such companies, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our success and viability.\nOur primary focus for the foreseeable future will be shepherding SkinTE through the FDA regulatory process, which is a lengthy process with no assurance of success. Stockholders should understand that we are an early-stage biotechnology company with a limited history of revenue-generating operations. Therefore, we are subject to all the risks and uncertainties inherent in an early-stage biotechnology company, in particular those businesses engaged in the pursuit of tissue regenerative technologies.\nAccordingly, you should evaluate our prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays, and difficulties frequently encountered by early-stage companies, particularly those in the biotechnology field. In particular, stockholders should consider that there is a significant risk that we will not be able to:\n\u25cf successfully complete any preclinical or other studies necessary to submit an IND to the FDA for SkinTE;\n\u25cf successfully compile clinical, CMC, and other information necessary to submit an IND to the FDA for SkinTE;\n\u25cf obtain FDA approval to commence human clinical trials of SkinTE;\n\u25cf successfully enroll sufficient numbers of qualified patients to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf successfully meet the primary endpoints in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf implement or execute our current business plan, or that our current business plan is sound;\n\u25cf raise sufficient funds in the capital markets or otherwise to fully effectuate our business plan;\n\u25cf maintain our management team;\n\u25cf determine that the processes and technologies that we have developed or will develop are commercially viable; and/or\n\u25cf attract, enter into, or maintain contracts with potential commercial partners, healthcare providers, licensors of technology, or licensees of our technologies.\nAny of the foregoing risks may adversely affect us and result in the failure of our business. In addition, we expect to encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other known and unknown factors.\nOur ability to timely submit an IND to the FDA may depend on circumstances outside of our control.\nOur ability to submit an IND to the FDA depends on a variety of factors. We must submit the results of various preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available past clinical data or literature, and a proposed clinical protocol to the FDA as part of the IND. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry and formulation, as well as other studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, subject to any adjustments allowed by the FDA. The FDA may require that we conduct additional preclinical testing for any product candidate before it allows us to initiate the clinical testing under any IND, which may lead to additional delays and increase the costs of our preclinical and clinical development. An IND also involves considerable work from our employees and advisors. Difficulties or delays in the process will likely increase the costs associated with the IND and result in an unanticipated reduction in the working capital we have available to pursue the IND and BLA.\nClinical trials are expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to design and implement, and as a result there is significant uncertainty with respect to successful completion.\nHuman clinical trials are expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. The costs of our clinical trials may increase if the FDA does not agree with our clinical development plans or requires us to conduct additional clinical trials, data analyses, or data audits to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of SkinTE or future product candidates. Should we be unable to cover the expense of our clinical trials or encounter difficulties in execution of our clinical trials it is unlikely we will be able to advance SkinTE or other product candidates to marketing approval, which would have a significant adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nBiotechnology and pharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of uncertainty. While we have generated revenue from sales of SkinTE, we have never achieved profitable operating results in our regenerative medicine product segment, and we may never be able to do so.\nOur ability to generate revenue depends in large part on our ability, alone or with partners, to successfully complete the development of, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for, and commercialize, product candidates. Following the end of the FDA\u2019s period of enforcement discretion (currently scheduled through May 2021) for regenerative tissue products, we may need to cease selling SkinTE until the FDA approves a BLA, and then we will only be able to market the product for indications that have been approved in a BLA. Our ability to generate future revenues from product sales of regenerative tissue products depends heavily on our success in:\n\u25cf progressing our discovery-stage programs into pre-clinical testing;\n\u25cf progressing our pre-clinical programs into human clinical trials;\n\u25cf completing requisite clinical trials through all phases of clinical development of our product candidates;\n\u25cf seeking and obtaining marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;\n\u25cf launching and commercializing our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, if any, with a partner or, if launched independently, successfully establishing a manufacturing, sales force, marketing, and distribution infrastructure;\n\u25cf identifying and developing new product candidates;\n\u25cf establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties;\n\u25cf maintaining, protecting, expanding, and enforcing our intellectual property; and\n\u25cf attracting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biologic and pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to predict the likelihood or timing for when we may receive regulatory approval of our product candidates or when we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability, if ever. If we are unable to establish a development and or commercialization partnership, or do not receive regulatory approvals, our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations will be adversely affected. Even if we or a partner obtain the regulatory approvals to market and sell one or more of our product candidates, we may never generate significant revenues from any commercial sales for several reasons, including because the market for our products may be smaller than we anticipate, or products may not be adopted by physicians and payors, or because our products may not be as efficacious or safe as other treatment options. If we fail to successfully commercialize one or more products, by ourselves or through a partner, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain and grow our business and our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and the failure of such third parties to perform or delays in performance could increase our costs or prevent us from being able to use the results of the trials.\nWe depend and will continue to depend upon independent investigators and collaborators, such as universities and medical institutions, to conduct our clinical trials under agreements with us. Negotiations of budgets and contracts with study sites may result in delays to our development timelines and increased costs. We will rely heavily on these third parties over the course of our clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and these third parties are required to comply with current good clinical practices (\u201ccGCPs\u201d), which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for product candidates in clinical development. The FDA enforces these cGCPs through periodic inspections of clinical trial sponsors, principal investigators, and clinical trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable cGCP regulations, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA could require us to perform additional clinical trials, undertake data analyses or audits, or adopt new or revised clinical study procedures and systems before approving our marketing applications. It is possible the FDA could determine that any of our clinical trials fail to comply with the cGCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with a biologic product produced under current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and will require a large number of test patients. Our failure or any failure by these third parties to comply with these regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations, or healthcare privacy and security laws.\nAny third parties conducting our clinical trials are not and will not be our employees and, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with these third parties, we cannot control whether they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing preclinical, clinical, and nonclinical programs. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other drug development activities, which could affect their performance on our behalf. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to complete development of, obtain regulatory approval of or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for SkinTE or other product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nSwitching or adding third parties to conduct our clinical trials involves substantial cost and requires extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new third party commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nEven if we are permitted to conduct clinical trials for SkinTE under an IND, we may experience difficulties in subject enrollment in our clinical trials for a variety of reasons. The timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the study until its conclusion. The enrollment of patients depends on many factors, including:\n\u25cf the patient eligibility criteria defined in the clinical trial protocol;\n\u25cf the size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial\u2019s primary endpoints;\n\u25cf the proximity of patients to the study site;\n\u25cf the design of the clinical trial;\n\u25cf our ability to retain clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain and maintain patient consents;\n\u25cf the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the clinical trials before completion;\n\u25cf competing clinical trials and approved therapies available for patients; and\n\u25cf unexpected difficulties, complications, and delays that could arise at any stage of our clinical trials as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise.\nIn particular, SkinTE clinical trials will be designed to test the treatment of wounds with specific characteristics and be conducted at a limited number of sites, so to a large extent we will have no control or influence on the number and timing of enrolling patients that are suitable for our trials.\nOur clinical trials could compete with other companies\u2019 clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our product candidates, and this competition could reduce the number and types of patients available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our clinical trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. It is possible we could conduct our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors may use, which could reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trial in these clinical trial sites. Delays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of our planned clinical trials, which could prevent completion of the clinical trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of SkinTE.\nAny adverse developments that occur during any clinical trials conducted by academic investigators or other entities conducting clinical trials under separate INDs may negatively affect the conduct of our clinical trials or our ability to obtain regulatory approvals or commercialize our product candidates.\nSkin-based HCT/Ps and other HCT/Ps for wound care are being used, or may be used, by third parties in clinical trials that are completely independent of our plan for SkinTE. We have no control over the conduct of those clinical trials. If serious adverse events occur during those or any other clinical trials using technologies similar to ours, the FDA and other regulatory authorities may delay our clinical trial, or could delay, limit, or deny approval of SkinTE or require us to conduct additional clinical trials as a condition to marketing approval, which would increase our costs. If we receive regulatory approval for SkinTE and a new and serious safety issue is identified in connection with clinical trials conducted by third parties, the applicable regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of SkinTE or otherwise restrict our ability to market and sell our product. In addition, treating physicians may be less willing to administer our products due to concerns over such adverse events, which would limit our ability to commercialize our products.\nAdverse side effects or other safety risks associated with our product candidates could cause us to suspend or discontinue clinical trials or delay or preclude approval.\nDuring our DFU RCT and in the course of our commercial sales of SkinTE we did not observe undesirable side effects from the application of SkinTE. There is no assurance, however, that undesirable side effects will not be observed in our clinical trials, whether or not they are caused by SkinTE. Any such undesirable side effects could result in the delay, suspension, or termination of clinical trials by the FDA or us for a number of reasons. In addition, because the patients who will be enrolled in our clinical trials may be suffering from one or more serious chronic or life-threatening conditions it may be difficult to accurately assess the relationship between SkinTE and adverse events experienced by very ill patients. If we elect or are required to delay, suspend, or terminate any of our clinical trials, the commercial prospects of SkinTE could be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from SkinTE could be delayed or eliminated. In addition, serious adverse events observed in clinical trials could hinder or prevent market acceptance of SkinTE. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations significantly.\nWe may form or seek strategic alliances, enter into additional licensing arrangements, or participate in acquisition transactions in the future, and we may not succeed in realizing the benefits of such alliances, licensing arrangements, or acquisition transactions.\nWe may form or seek strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations, enter into licensing arrangements, or participate in an acquisition in which we are the acquirer or the target with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to SkinTE or our other product candidates we may develop. Any of these relationships or transactions may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders, or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic opportunities and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in arranging a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy or achieve commercial success. If we license or acquire products or businesses, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. It is possible that, following a strategic transaction or license, we may not achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction. Any delays in entering into new strategic partnership agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates in certain geographies for certain indications, which would harm our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval of SkinTE or future product candidates, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, hospitals, third-party payors, and others in the medical community.\nThe development and use of HCT/Ps for tissue regeneration therapies is a recently developed technology and may not become broadly accepted by physicians, patients, hospitals, third-party payors, and others in the medical community. Many factors will influence whether SkinTE or any other product candidates we may develop are accepted in the market, including:\n\u25cf the clinical indications for which our product candidates are approved, if any;\n\u25cf physicians, hospitals, and patients considering our product candidates as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u25cf the potential and perceived advantages of our product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u25cf product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf limitations or warnings contained in the labeling approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf the extent and quality of the clinical evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of our product candidates;\n\u25cf the timing of market introduction of our product candidates as well as competitive products;\n\u25cf the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;\n\u25cf the willingness and ability of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of coverage by third-party payors, including government authorities;\n\u25cf relative convenience and ease of administration, including as compared to alternative treatments and competitive therapies; and\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our or any of our strategic partners\u2019 sales and marketing efforts.\nIf our product candidates are approved but fail to achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, hospitals, or others in the medical community, we will not be able to generate significant revenue. Even if our products achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to maintain that market acceptance over time if new products or technologies are introduced that are more favorably received than our products, are more cost effective or render our products obsolete.\nOur ability to timely submit an IND to the FDA may depend on circumstances outside of our control.\nOur ability to submit an IND to the FDA depends on a variety of factors. We must submit the results of various preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, all available past clinical data or literature, and a proposed clinical protocol to the FDA as part of the IND. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry and formulation, as well as other studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, subject to any adjustments allowed by the FDA. The FDA may require that we conduct additional preclinical testing or for any product candidate before it allows us to initiate the clinical testing under any IND, which may lead to additional delays and increase the costs of our preclinical and clinical development. An IND also involves considerable work from our employees and advisors. Difficulties or delays in the process will likely increase the costs associated with the IND and result in an unanticipated reduction in the working capital we have available to pursue the IND and BLA.\nIf we are required to or voluntarily withdraw, recall, or cease product manufacturing, it could significantly increase our costs, damage our reputation, and disrupt our business.\nThe manufacturing, marketing, and processing of our products and product candidates involves an inherent risk that our tissue products or processes do not meet applicable quality standards and requirements. In that event, we may voluntarily implement a recall, market withdrawal, or cessation of manufacturing or may be required to do so by a regulatory authority. A recall, market withdrawal, or cessation of manufacturing of one of our products would be costly and would divert management resources. Any such action involving one of our products, or a similar product processed by another entity, also could impair sales of our products because of confusion concerning the scope of the recall or withdrawal, or because of the damage to our reputation for quality and safety.\nWe face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government healthcare reform.\nThere have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payers to control healthcare costs (including but not limited to capitation - the generalized cap on annual fees for a type of service or procedure such as burn or wound care or rehabilitation), and generally, to reform the healthcare system in the United States. There are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or the consequences are not fully understood. These proposals may affect aspects of our business. We also cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they will be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.\nWe face the risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacturing, processing, and marketing of human cellular and tissue-based products. We may be subject to such claims if our products cause, or appear to have caused, an injury during clinical trials or after commercialization. Claims may be made by patients, healthcare providers, or others selling our products. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of merit, could be costly, divert management attention, and result in adverse publicity, which could result in the withdrawal, or reduced acceptance, of our products in the market.\nAlthough we have obtained product liability insurance, such insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations and we may not be able to maintain this insurance. Also, it is possible that claims could exceed the limits of our coverage. If we are unable to obtain or maintain product liability insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms with adequate coverage, or otherwise protect ourselves against potential product liability claims or we underestimate the amount of insurance we need, we could be exposed to significant liabilities, which may harm our business. A product liability or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could result in significant costs and significant harm to our business.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and evolving field and face competition from regenerative medicine, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical companies, tissue engineering entities, tissue processors, and medical device manufacturers, as well as new market entrants, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do.\nWe operate in a competitive and continually evolving field. Competition from other regenerative medicine, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical companies, tissue engineering entities, tissue processors, medical device companies, and from research and academic institutions is intense, expected to increase, subject to rapid change, and could be significantly affected by new product introductions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations and well-established sales forces. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors, either alone or with collaborative partners, may succeed in developing, acquiring, or licensing on an exclusive basis drug or biologic products that are more effective, safer, more easily commercialized, or less costly than our product candidates or may develop proprietary technologies or secure patent protection that we may need for the development of our technologies and products. Our failure to compete effectively would have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Operating Activities\nWe may be required to discontinue sales of SkinTE, which would adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe continue to market SkinTE as a 361 HCT/P product and under the FDA\u2019s policy of enforcement discretion (currently scheduled through May 2021) as we work to transition SkinTE to a Section 351 product. Our net revenues from SkinTE sales in 2020 were $3.7 million. Following the end of the FDA\u2019s period of enforcement discretion, we may need to cease selling SkinTE until the FDA approves a BLA, and then we will only be able to market the product for indications that have been approved in a BLA. The loss of our ability to market and sell SkinTE would have an adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have a limited history of operation with our laboratory testing service so we are unable to predict with any certainty what contribution it will make to defraying our operating expenses in the future, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for the use of our resources to achieve our goals.\nNet loss from our contract services segment was $39,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a net loss of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and this reversal is directly attributable to the new source of revenue we found in COVD-19 testing. Net revenues from our historical clinical service offerings were $59,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $4.3 million in net revenues generated by COVID-19 testing services. COVID-19 testing is a relatively new business activity that we started with existing equipment and personnel when the opportunity presented itself, which means there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with this new business activity. We obtained 96% of COVID-19 testing revenues in 2020 under 30-day renewable testing agreements with multiple nursing home and pharmacy facilities in the state of New York controlled by a single company. On March 26, 2021, we were advised by the company that controls the New York nursing homes and pharmacy facilities we service that the state of New York is allowing on-site employee testing and that on-site testing will be implemented for the New York facilities we service, which will likely have the effect of substantially diminishing our revenues from COVID-19 testing after the first quarter of 2021. We are a relatively unknown testing laboratory, so we have relied on word of mouth and management relationships to connect with prospects and vied for new business on the basis of price and service, and we cannot predict how well this marketing approach will work in finding new customers for Arches\u2019 testing services. Even if we are able to find new customers for the COVID-19 testing business there remain substantial risks associated with the COVID-19 testing business, including the following:\n\u25cf our plan is to commit our financial business resources to advancing our IND and BLA for SkinTE, not to develop or scale the COVID-19 testing business;\n\u25cf competition from other COVID-19 testing facilities is intense, expected to increase, subject to rapid change, and could be significantly affected by the introduction of new testing products;\n\u25cf there are a number of competitors for testing services that have substantially greater financial, marketing, testing, and managerial resources than we do;\n\u25cf the United States is embarking on an aggressive vaccination program for the entire population against COVID-19 and this could impact the need or demand for testing in the future;\n\u25cf we obtained CLIA registration for our laboratory because this is a prerequisite to providing testing services, and we must continue to comply with the practices and procedures required for registration in order to be able to continue to provide testing services;\n\u25cf our ability to service our testing customers depends on the continuous operation of our testing equipment without significant disruption; and\n\u25cf we need reliable sources of reagents and other supplies required for COVID-19 testing.\nA significant decline or loss of the COVID-19 testing business in 2021 that we are unable to substantially replace with new customers could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur manufacturing and COVID 19 testing operations depend primarily on one facility. If this facility is destroyed or we experience any manufacturing or laboratory difficulties, disruptions, or delays, this could adversely affect our ability to conduct our clinical trials or perform laboratory testing services.\nAll of the manufacturing of SkinTE and COVID-19 testing takes place at our single U.S. facility. If regulatory, manufacturing, or other problems require us to discontinue production or laboratory operations at our current facility, we would not be able to supply SkinTE for clinical trials or operate our COVID-19 testing business, which would adversely impact our business. If this facility or the equipment in it is significantly damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, power loss, or similar events, we may not be able to quickly or inexpensively replace our manufacturing or laboratory capacity or replace the facility at all. In the event of a temporary or protracted loss of this facility or equipment, we might not be able to quickly transfer manufacturing to a third party or laboratory testing to our IBEX facility. Even if we could transfer manufacturing, the shift would likely be expensive and time-consuming, particularly since an alternative facility would need to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing and quality requirements and, if applicable, FDA approval would be required before any products manufactured at that facility could be used. Similarly, if we are able to transfer laboratory testing to IBEX, the transfer will likely be expensive and require CLIA registration.\nWe depend on our senior management team and the loss of one or more key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees will negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical and other personnel. We are highly dependent upon our senior management and other key personnel. Although we have entered into employment agreements with all of our executive officers, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time. The replacement of any of our key personnel likely would involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could therefore negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we do not carry any key person insurance policies that could offset potential loss of service under applicable circumstances.\nWe have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than us. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources and, potentially, damages.\nIn addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our stock awards declines, it may harm our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. Many of our employees have become or will soon become vested in a substantial amount of our common stock or a number of common stock options. Our employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares, or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly below the market price of our common stock. Our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain additional executive officers and other key employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, it will negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially affect our operations, as well as the business or operations of third parties with whom we conduct business. Our business could be adversely affected by the effects of other future health pandemics in regions where we or third parties on which we rely have significant business operations.\nCOVID-19 has spread globally and the World Health Organization has declared it a pandemic. While still evolving, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant worldwide economic and financial turmoil and has fueled concerns that it will lead to a global recession. On March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19 and the majority of states, including the state of Utah, and local governments have since issued orders restricting the operations of non-essential businesses or restricting activities of residents. As the pandemic has evolved since March 2020, some restrictions have eased, however, if in the future there are surges of infection and hospitalization rates, more severe restrictions many be implemented by local government agencies. We are following the recommendations of local health authorities to minimize exposure risk for our employees and visitors, including requiring designated employees to work from home. The continued and prolonged implementation of restrictions by federal, state, and local authorities to slow the spread of COVID-19 have disrupted and, we expect, will continue to disrupt, our business and operations.\nDepending upon the length of the COVID-19 pandemic and whether the FDA allows us to commence our clinical trials once we submit our proposed IND, our future clinical trials for SkinTE may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. If COVID-19 continues to spread in the U.S. and elsewhere, we may experience additional disruptions that could adversely impact our business and clinical trials, including: (i) delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials approved under our IND; (ii) delays or difficulties in clinical site activation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site personnel; (iii) delays in clinical sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct our clinical trial, including interruption in shipping that may affect the transport of our clinical trial product; (iv) changes in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 pandemic that may require us to change the ways in which our clinical trial is to be conducted, which may result in unexpected costs, or to discontinue the clinical trial altogether; (v) diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trial; (vi) interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers, and others, or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures, the occurrence of which could affect the integrity of clinical trial data; (vii) risk that participants enrolled in our clinical trials will acquire COVID-19 while the clinical trial is ongoing, which could impact the results of the clinical trial, including by increasing the number of observed adverse events; (viii) delays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees, and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees; (ix) limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our clinical trial because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people; (x) refusal of the FDA to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies; and (xi) interruption or delays to our clinical trial activities.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, operations, and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response; our ability to continue daily operations, including as a result of travel restrictions and people working from home; and any closures of our and our business partners\u2019 offices and facilities.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain and may be inadequate, which could have a material and adverse effect on us.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights in technologies that presently consist of trade secrets, patents, and patent applications. We currently have one issued patent and one allowed patent application in the United States relating to our MPFU technology. We intend to continue our patenting activities and rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws and nondisclosure, confidentiality, and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology, and there can be no assurance these methods of protection will be effective. These legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. In addition, our presently pending patent applications include claims to material aspects of our activities that are not currently protected by issued patents in the United States. The patent application process can be time consuming and expensive. We cannot ensure that any of the pending patent applications already filed or that may be filed or acquired will result in issued patents. Competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop procedures that provide outcomes that are comparable or even superior to ours. There is no assurance that the inventors of the patents and applications were the first-to-invent or the first-inventor-to-file on the inventions, or that a third party will not claim ownership in one of our patents or patent applications. We cannot assure you that a third party does not have or will not obtain patents that could preclude us from practicing the patents we own or license now or in the future.\nThe failure to obtain and maintain patents or protect our intellectual property rights could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We cannot be certain that, if challenged, any patents we have obtained or ultimately obtain would be upheld because a determination of the validity and enforceability of a patent involves complex issues of fact and law. If one or more of any patents we have obtained or ultimately obtain is invalidated or held unenforceable, such an outcome could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we might otherwise have had.\nIn the event a competitor infringes upon any patent we have obtained or ultimately obtain, or a third party including but not limited to a university or other research institution, makes a claim of ownership over our patents or other intellectual property rights, confirming, defending, or enforcing those rights may be costly, uncertain, difficult, and time consuming.\nThere can be no assurance that a third party, including, but not limited to, a university or other research institution that our founders were associated with in the past, will not make claims to ownership or other claims related to our technology.\nThere can be no assurance that a third party, including but not limited to, a university or other research institution that our founders were associated with in the past, will not make claims to ownership or other claims related to our technology. We believe we have developed our technology outside of any institutions, but we cannot guarantee such institutions would not assert a claim to the contrary. Even if successful, litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights could be expensive and time consuming and could divert our management\u2019s attention. Further, bringing litigation for patent enforcement subjects us to the potential for counterclaims. If one or more of our current or future patents is challenged in U.S. or foreign courts or the United States Patent and Trademark Office or foreign patent offices, the patent(s) may be found invalid or unenforceable, which could harm our competitive position. If any court or any patent office ultimately cancels or narrows the claims in any of our patents through any pre- or post-grant patent proceedings, such an outcome could prevent or hinder us from being able to enforce the patent against competitors. Such adverse decisions could negatively affect our future revenue and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully appropriated, used, or disclosed intellectual property of their former employers.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed by other companies, universities, or academic institutions. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a prior employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to claims that former or current employees, collaborators, or other third parties have an interest in our patents, patent applications, or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. Litigation may be necessary to defend against any claims challenging inventorship. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how related to SkinTE or any of our product candidates, our competitive position would be impaired and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSome of our technology, including our knowledge regarding certain aspects of the manufacture of SkinTE and potential product candidates, is unpatented and is maintained by us as trade secrets. To protect these trade secrets, the information is restricted to our employees, consultants, collaborators, and advisors on a need-to-know basis. In addition, we require our employees, consultants, collaborators, and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements, however, do not ensure protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information, and these agreements may be breached. A breach of confidentiality could affect our competitive position. In addition, in some situations, these agreements and other obligations of our employees to assign intellectual property to the Company may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants, collaborators, or advisors have previous employment or consulting relationships. Also, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.\nAdequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. The disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, which could prohibit us from developing our treatment, require us to obtain licenses from third parties, or to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages. We have not obtained and do not intend to obtain any formal legal opinion regarding our freedom to practice our technology.\nThird parties could assert that our processes, SkinTE, product candidates, or technology infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Whether a process, product, or technology infringes a patent or other intellectual property involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain. We cannot be certain that we will not be found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. Because patent applications may remain unpublished for certain periods of time and may take years to be issued as patents, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware or that do not currently contain claims of concern that may later result in issued patents that SkinTE, our product candidates, procedures, or processes will infringe. There may be existing patents that SkinTE, our product candidates, procedures, or processes infringe, of which infringement we are not aware. Third parties could also assert ownership over our intellectual property. Such an ownership claim could cause us to incur significant costs to litigate the ownership issues. If an ownership claim by a third party were upheld as valid, we may be unable to obtain a license from the third party on acceptable terms, to continue to make, use, or sell technology free from claims by that third party of infringement of the third party\u2019s intellectual property. We have not obtained, and do not have a present intention to obtain, any legal opinion regarding our freedom to practice our technology.\nIf we are unsuccessful in actions we bring against the patents of other parties, and it is determined that we infringe upon the patents of third parties, we may be subject to injunctions, or otherwise prevented from commercializing potential products or services in the relevant jurisdiction, or may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or develop or obtain alternative technologies, any of which could harm our business. Furthermore, if such challenges to our patent rights are not resolved in our favor, we could be delayed or prevented from entering into new collaborations or from commercializing certain product candidates or services, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to enforce our patent rights against third parties.\nSuccessful challenge of any patents or future patents or patent applications such as through opposition, reexamination, inter partes review, interference, or derivation proceedings could result in a loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required relating to intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation. In addition, during litigation there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property in countries outside of the United States.\nIntellectual property law outside the United States is uncertain and, in many countries, is currently undergoing review and revisions. The laws of some countries do not protect patent and other intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States laws. Third parties may challenge our patents or applications in foreign countries by initiating pre- and post-grant oppositions or invalidation proceedings. Developments during opposition or invalidation proceedings in one country may directly or indirectly affect a corresponding patent or patent application in another country in an adverse manner. It may be necessary or useful for us to participate in proceedings to determine the validity of our patents or our competitors\u2019 patents that have been issued in countries other than the United States. This could result in substantial costs, divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not continue to develop or be sustained.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, or NASDAQ, we cannot assure you that an active, liquid trading market for our shares will continue to develop or be sustained. If an active market for our common stock does not continue to develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for you to sell shares quickly or without depressing the market price for the shares or to sell your shares at all.\nWe are pursuing a plan to advance regulatory approval of SkinTE, so delay or failure in achieving our milestones could adversely affect our prospects and the value of ownership of our common stock.\nWhile a positive contributor to operating results, we do not plan to commit any meaningful amount of capital to scale our testing and research services business because we plan to devote our capital resources to the advancement of SkinTE through the regulatory process. We believe growth in stockholder value will follow if and when we achieve milestones in the process of pursuing our IND and BLA for SkinTE. To the extent that we encounter problems or delays in this process, our growth prospects and stockholder value could be materially, adversely affected.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you may not be able to resell some or all your shares at a desired price.\nOur stock price has been highly volatile during the 12-month period ended February 28, 2021, with closing stock prices ranging from a high of $1.85 per share to a low of $0.61 per share. The stock market in general, and the market for biotech companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that, at times, has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Because of this volatility, investors in our stock may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u25cf the timing or success of obtaining regulatory licenses or approvals for marketing our products;\n\u25cf the initiation, timing, progress, and results of our pre-clinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf sufficiency of our working capital to fund our operations over the next 12 months and beyond;\n\u25cf infrastructure required to support operations in future periods, including the expected costs thereof;\n\u25cf estimates associated with revenue recognition, asset impairments, and cash flows;\n\u25cf variance in our estimates of future operating costs;\n\u25cf the impact of new accounting pronouncements;\n\u25cf size and growth of our target markets;\n\u25cf the initiation, timing, progress, and results of our research and development programs;\n\u25cf issues in manufacturing our product candidates or future approved products;\n\u25cf regulatory developments or enforcement in the United States and foreign countries with respect to our product candidates or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u25cf competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning patents, patent applications, or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf introduction of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements by us, our collaborators, or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations, or capital commitments;\n\u25cf changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, who cover our common stock;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u25cf public concern over our product candidates or any future approved products;\n\u25cf threatened or actual litigation;\n\u25cf future or anticipated sales of our common stock;\n\u25cf share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf changes in the structure of health care payment systems in the United States or overseas;\n\u25cf failure of any of our products or product candidates to perform safely or effectively or achieve commercial success;\n\u25cf economic and other external factors or other disasters or crises;\n\u25cf period-to-period fluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u25cf general market conditions and market conditions for biopharmaceutical stocks; and\n\u25cf overall fluctuations in U.S. equity markets.\nIn addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. Defending such litigation could result in substantial defense costs and divert the time and attention of our management, which could seriously harm our business.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. As of March 25, 2021, we had 80,319,378 shares of common stock outstanding, all of which, other than shares held by our directors and certain officers and affiliates, were eligible for sale in the public market, subject in some cases to compliance with the requirements of Rule 144, including the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements. As of March 25, 2021, we also had a significant number of securities convertible into, or allowing the purchase of, our common stock, including 19,314,143 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, 6,079,210 options and rights to acquire shares of our common stock that are outstanding under our equity incentive plans, and 4,271,350 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans.\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Restated Bylaws, and Delaware law could deter a change of our management, which could discourage or delay offers to acquire us.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and by-laws, could discourage or make it more difficult to accomplish a proxy contest or other change in our management or the acquisition of control by a holder of a substantial amount of our voting stock. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish, or could deter, transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interests or in our best interests. These provisions include:\n\u25cf we have a classified Board requiring that members of the Board be elected in different years, which lengthens the time needed to elect a new majority of the Board;\n\u25cf our Board is authorized to issue up to 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be issued by our Board to increase the number of outstanding shares or change the balance of voting control and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u25cf stockholders are not entitled to remove directors other than by a two-thirds vote and only for cause;\n\u25cf stockholders cannot call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u25cf we require all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders, and not by written consent; and\n\u25cf stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings.\nWe are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions by prohibiting Delaware corporations from engaging in specified business combinations with particular stockholders of those companies. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that investors are willing to pay for our stock.\nBecause we do not expect to declare cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, stockholders must rely on appreciation of the value of our common stock for any return on their investment.\nWhile we have in the past declared and paid cash dividends on our capital stock, we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not expect to declare or pay any additional cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, if any, will provide a return to investors in this offering.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management because of being a public company.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we are incurring, and will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting, and other costs. These costs could negatively affect our financial results. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and stock exchanges, may increase legal and financial compliance costs, and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules also might make it more difficult for us to obtain some types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on committees of our board of directors or as members of senior management", "PERMNO": 90539, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PTE"}
