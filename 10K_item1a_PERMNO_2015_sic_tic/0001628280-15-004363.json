{"cik": "1078075", "company": "NETSCOUT SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-05-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information in this report, the following discussion should be considered carefully in evaluating NetScout and our business. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements under Section 21E of the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and are identified by terminology such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cseeks,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cpotential\u201d or \u201ccontinue,\u201d or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Actual events or results may differ materially. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below and in our other filings with the SEC. These factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement.\nOur operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors. Except for the historical information in this report, the matters contained in this report include forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. The following factors are among many that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in or implied by forward-looking statements made in this report. These statements involve the risks and uncertainties identified below as well as additional risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are immaterial but may also impact our business operations. Such factors are among many that may have a material adverse impact upon our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks related to the proposed acquisition of Danaher's Communications Business\nThe announcement and pendency of the proposed acquisition of the Communications Business could have an adverse effect on our stock price, business, financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nThe announcement and pendency of the transaction could disrupt our business in the following ways, among others:\n\u2022\nOur customers, channel partners and other third-party business partners may delay or defer purchase decisions with regard to our products and services or may seek to terminate and/or renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the transaction, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with us or otherwise; and\n\u2022\nCurrent and prospective employees may experience uncertainty regarding their future roles with the combined company, which might adversely affect our ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel and may adversely affect the focus of our employees on our sales efforts.\nShould they occur, any of these matters could adversely affect our stock price or harm our financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nFailure to complete the proposed acquisition of the Communications Business could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.\nCompletion of the transactions is conditioned upon NetScout and Danaher satisfying certain closing conditions, including the approval of the shares to be issued in connection with the transaction by our stockholders, as set forth in the merger agreement. The required conditions to closing may not be satisfied in a timely manner, if at all, or, if permissible, waived. If the transaction is not consummated for these or any other reasons, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and will be subject to a number of risks including:\n\u2022\nThe market price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the transaction will be completed;\n\u2022\nWe may experience negative reactions to the termination of the transaction from customers, channel partners, suppliers, strategic partners, investors or analysts;\n\u2022\nWe would not realize any of the anticipated benefits of having completed the transaction;\n\u2022\nWe may be required to pay a termination fee of $55.0 million to Danaher if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances; and\n\u2022\nOur expenses incurred related to the transaction, such as legal and accounting fees, must be paid even if the transaction is not completed and may not, except in certain circumstances, be recovered from Danaher.\nIn addition, any delay in the consummation of the transaction or, any uncertainty about the consummation of the transaction, may adversely affect our future business, growth, revenue and results of operations.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the acquisition of the Communications Business.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the transaction for a number of reasons including if:\n\u2022\nWe do not achieve the perceived benefits of the transaction as rapidly or to the extent anticipated;\n\u2022\nThe effect of the transaction on our business and prospects is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts; or\n\u2022\nInvestors react negatively to the effect of the transaction on our business and prospects.\nNetScout and Danaher may be unable to satisfy the conditions or obtain the approvals required to complete the proposed transactions.\nThe consummation of the proposed transactions is subject to numerous conditions including (i) consummation of certain transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of October 12, 2014, by and among Danaher, NetScout and Newco (as the same may be amended from time to time) (the Distribution Agreement) (such as the separation of the Communications Business from Danaher\u2019s other business) and (ii) the receipt of NetScout stockholder approval for the issuance of NetScout common stock in the First Merger (as defined in Note 20 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We cannot make any assurances that the acquisition of the Communications Business and related transactions will be consummated on the terms or timeline\ncurrently contemplated, or at all. Each of Danaher and NetScout has and will continue to expend time and resources and incur expenses related to the proposed transactions.\nThe risk to our stockholders that the calculation of the merger consideration will not be adjusted if the value of the business or assets of the Communications Business declines or if the value of NetScout increases before the transactions are completed.\nThe calculation of the number of shares of NetScout common stock to be distributed in the Transaction will not be adjusted if the value of the business or assets of the Communications Business declines prior to the consummation of the Transaction or the value of NetScout increases prior to the Transaction. We will not be required to consummate the Transaction if there has been any material adverse effect on the Communications Business. However, we will not be permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement or resolicit the vote of our stockholders because of any changes in the market price of our common stock or any changes in the value of the Communications Business that do not constitute a material adverse effect with respect to the Communications Business.\nOur estimates and judgments related to the acquisition accounting models used to record the purchase price allocation may be inaccurate.\nOur management will make significant accounting judgments and estimates for the application of acquisition accounting under GAAP and the underlying valuation models. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods if our accounting judgments and estimates related to these models prove to be inaccurate.\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets.\nBased on the closing price of our common stock on May 1, 2015, the proposed transaction will add approximately $3.0 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets to our consolidated balance sheet. In accordance with GAAP, our management periodically assesses these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect results of operations in the periods recognized.\nIf completed, the proposed transactions may not be successful or achieve their anticipated benefits.\nIf the proposed transactions are completed we may not be able to successfully realize anticipated growth opportunities or integrate our business and operations with the Communications Business\u2019 business and operations. After the transactions, we will have significantly more revenue, expenses, assets and employees than we did prior to the transactions. In the internal restructuring and reorganization of the Communications Business and related assets and liabilities, we will also be assuming certain liabilities of the Communications Business and taking on other obligations (including collective bargaining agreements and certain non-U.S. pension obligations with respect to transferred employees). We may not successfully or cost-effectively integrate the Communications Business\u2019 business and operations into our existing business and operations. Even if the combined company is able to integrate the combined businesses and operations successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth and other opportunities that we currently expect from the transactions within the anticipated time frame, or at all.\nWe are required to abide by potentially significant restrictions, which could limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions (such as the issuance of our common stock or the undertaking of a merger or consolidation) that otherwise could be advantageous.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment to Danaher and/or its stockholders of the proposed transactions, under the Tax Matters Agreement in substantially the form attached as Exhibit A to the Distribution Agreement (the Tax Matters Agreement), we are restricted from taking any action that prevents such transactions from being tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in other transactions, including using our common stock to make acquisitions and in connection with equity capital market transactions that might increase the value of our business.\nThe Distribution could result in significant tax liability, and NetScout may be obligated to indemnify Danaher for any such tax liability imposed on Danaher.\nThe Distribution (as defined in Note 20 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and certain aspects of the internal restructuring to separate and consolidate certain assets and liabilities used in\nthe Communications Business under Newco, could be taxable to Danaher if Newco, its unit holders, NetScout or NetScout\u2019s stockholders were to engage in certain actions specified under the Tax Matters Agreement. In such cases, under the Tax Matters Agreement, Newco and NetScout will be required to indemnify Danaher against any taxes that arise as a result of such specified actions. If Danaher were to recognize gain on the Distribution or certain aspects of the internal restructuring of the Communications Business for reasons not related to a specified action under the Tax Matters Agreement by Newco or NetScout, Danaher would not be entitled to be indemnified under the Tax Matters Agreement and the resulting tax to Danaher could have a material adverse effect on Danaher. If Newco or NetScout were required to indemnify Danaher as a result of the Distribution or certain aspects of the internal restructuring of the Communications Business being taxable, this indemnification obligation would likely be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on us, including with respect to our financial condition and results of operations.\nUpon completion of the proposed transactions, we will incur significant expenses in connection with the integration of the Communications Business.\nUpon completion of the proposed transactions, we expect to incur significant expenses in connection with the integration of the Communications Business, including integrating products and technology, personnel, information technology systems, accounting systems, suppliers, and channel partners of each business and implementing consistent standards, policies, and procedures, and may possibly be subject to material write downs in assets and charges to earnings, which may include severance pay and other costs.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that may discourage other companies from trying to acquire NetScout. In addition, we will have more shares of our common stock outstanding after the transactions, which may discourage other companies from trying to acquire NetScout.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third-party from submitting a business combination proposal to NetScout prior to the closing of the proposed transactions that might result in greater value to our stockholders than the proposed transactions. For example, the Merger Agreement generally prohibits us from soliciting any takeover proposal. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated by NetScout or Danaher in circumstances that obligate us to pay a termination fee or to reimburse transaction expenses to Danaher, our liquidity or financial condition may be materially adversely affected as a result of such payment, and the requirement to make such a payment might deter third parties from proposing alternative business combination proposals. In addition, the Merger Agreement requires that we seek stockholder approval for the issuance of shares of our common stock in the First Merger, even if our board of directors changes its recommendation regarding the issuance of shares of our common stock in the First Merger.\nWe expect to issue 62.5 million shares of our common stock as part of the proposed transactions, assuming no adjustments pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Because we will be a significantly larger company and have significantly more shares of our common stock outstanding after the proposed transactions, an acquisition of NetScout may become more expensive. As a result, some companies may not seek to acquire NetScout, and the reduction in potential parties that may seek to acquire NetScout could negatively impact the prices at which our common stock trades.\nRisks Related to the Combined Company\u2019s Business Following the Proposed Transactions\nWe will assume certain non-U.S. pension benefit obligations associated with the Communications Business. Future funding obligations related to these liabilities could restrict cash available for our operations, capital expenditures or other requirements, or require us to borrow additional funds.\nIn the proposed transactions, we will assume certain funded and unfunded non-U.S. pension obligations related to non-U.S. employees of the Communications Business who become employees of Newco to the extent the assumption is required by applicable law. In connection therewith, Danaher will transfer to us all assets set aside by Danaher to fund such non-U.S. pension obligations related to the Communications Business. If the non-U.S. pension liabilities transferred by Danaher exceed the assets transferred by Danaher, Danaher is obligated to transfer an amount of cash to us equal to the difference between the non-U.S. pension liabilities transferred and the assets transferred. The transfers of assets and non-U.S. pension liabilities will be governed by applicable law, provided that if the mechanism for the transfers is not mandated by applicable law, the assets and liabilities will be transferred on a projected benefit obligation basis in accordance with GAAP.\nFunding obligations with respect to non-U.S. pension plans change due to, among other things, the actual investment return on plan assets. Continued volatility in the capital markets may have a further negative impact on the funded status of the non-U.S. pension plans, which may in turn increase attendant funding obligations. Changing economic conditions, poor pension\ninvestment returns or other factors may require us to make substantial cash contributions to the pension plans in the future, preventing the use of increased cash contributions for other purposes and adversely affecting our liquidity.\nWhile we intend to comply with any future funding obligations for its non-U.S. pension benefit plans through the use of cash from operations, there can be no assurance that we will generate enough cash to do so and also meet its other required or intended cash uses. Our inability to fund these obligations through cash from operations could require it to seek funding from other sources, including through additional borrowings, which could materially increase our outstanding debt or debt service requirements.\nCurrent NetScout stockholders\u2019 ownership interest in NetScout will be substantially diluted in the proposed transactions.\nFollowing the consummation of the proposed transactions, our stockholders will, in the aggregate, own a significantly smaller percentage of NetScout than they will own of NetScout immediately prior to the consummation of the transactions. It is expected that immediately after consummation of the First Merger, pre-First Merger holders of Newco common units and Newco employees will hold approximately 59.5% of NetScout\u2019s common stock on a fully-diluted basis and NetScout\u2019s existing equityholders will hold approximately 40.5% of NetScout\u2019s common stock on a fully-diluted basis. Our current stockholders, as a group, will be able to exercise less influence over the management and policies of NetScout following the proposed transactions than they will exercise over the management and policies of NetScout immediately prior to the transactions.\nSales of our common stock after the proposed transactions may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe shares of our common stock to be issued in the proposed transactions to holders of Newco common units will generally be eligible for immediate resale. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market after the consummation of the proposed transactions or even the perception that these sales could occur.\nIt is expected that immediately after consummation of the First Merger, pre-First Merger holders of Newco common units and Newco employees will hold approximately 59.5% of NetScout\u2019s common stock on a fully-diluted basis and our existing equityholders will hold approximately 40.5% of our common stock on a fully-diluted basis, subject to potential adjustment under certain limited circumstances. Currently, Danaher stockholders may include index funds that have performance tied to certain stock indices and institutional investors subject to various investing guidelines. Because we may not be included in these indices following the consummation of the proposed transactions or may not meet the investing guidelines of some of these institutional investors, these index funds and institutional investors may decide to or may be required to sell the NetScout common stock that they receive in the proposed transactions. In addition, the investment fiduciaries of Danaher\u2019s defined contribution and defined benefit plans may decide to sell any NetScout common stock that the trusts for these plans receive in the proposed transactions, or may decide not to participate in the exchange offer, if applicable, in response to their fiduciary obligations under applicable law. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, may also make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital by selling equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nThe historical financial information of the Communications Business may not be representative of its results or financial condition if it had been operated independently of Danaher and, as a result, may not be a reliable indicator of its future results.\nThe Communications Business is currently operated by Danaher. Consequently, the financial information of the Communications Business included in this document has been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of the Communications Business and reflects all direct costs as well as assumptions and allocations made by management of Danaher. The financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Communications Business presented may be different from those that would have resulted had the Communications Business been operated independently of Danaher during the applicable periods or at the applicable dates. For example, in preparing the financial statements of the Communications Business, Danaher made allocations of costs and Danaher corporate expenses deemed to be attributable to the Communications Business. However, these costs and expenses reflect the costs and expenses attributable to the Communications Business operated as part of a larger organization and do not necessarily reflect costs and expenses that would be incurred by the Communications Business had it been operated independently. As a result, the historical financial information of the Communications Business may not be a reliable indicator of future results.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected following the proposed transactions if we cannot negotiate terms that are as favorable as those Danaher has received when we replaces contracts after the closing of the proposed transactions.\nPrior to consummation of the proposed transactions, certain functions (such as purchasing, information systems, sales, logistics and distribution) for the Communications Business are generally being performed under centralized systems that will not be transferred to us and, in some cases, under contracts that are also used for Danaher\u2019s other businesses and which are not intended to be assigned to us with the Communications Business. In addition, some other contracts that Danaher or its subsidiaries are a party to on behalf of the Communications Business require consents of third parties to assign them to Newco. While Danaher, under the Transition Services Agreement (in substantially the form attached as Exhibit B to the Distribution Agreement), will agree to provide us with certain services, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain those consents or negotiate terms that are as favorable as those Danaher received when and if we replace these services with its own agreements for similar services. Although we believe that we will be able to obtain any such consents or enter into new agreements for similar services, it is possible that the failure to obtain consents for or replace a significant number of these agreements for any of these services or to replace them on terms that as are as favorable as those Danaher has received could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations following the proposed transactions.\nOur failure to successfully integrate the Communications Business into our business within our expected timetable could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s future results and the market price of our common stock following the completion of the proposed transactions.\nThe success of the proposed transactions will depend, in large part, on our ability, as a combined company following the completion of the proposed transactions, to realize the anticipated benefits and on the sales and profitability of the combined company. To realize these anticipated benefits, the combined company must successfully integrate its respective businesses. This integration will be complex and time-consuming. The failure to successfully integrate and manage the challenges presented by the integration process may result in our failure to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of the proposed transactions.\nPotential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nlost sales and customers as a result of customers of NetScout or the Communications Business deciding not to do business with the combined company;\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing the larger, more complex, combined business;\n\u2022\nintegrating personnel of NetScout and the Communications Business while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and service to customers;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees; and\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the proposed transactions\nIf any of these events were to occur, our ability to maintain relationships with customers, channel partners, suppliers and employees or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the proposed transactions could be adversely affected, or could reduce our sales or earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results after the proposed transactions and, as a result, adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe success of the combined company will also depend on relationships with third parties and pre-existing customers and channel partners of NetScout and the Communications Business, which relationships may be affected by customer, channel partner or third-party preferences or public attitudes about the proposed transactions. Any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe combined company\u2019s success will depend on our ability to maintain and renew relationships with pre-existing customers, channel partners, suppliers, and other third parties of both NetScout and the Communications Business and our ability to establish new relationships. There can be no assurance that the business of the combined company will be able to maintain and renew pre-existing contracts and other business relationships, or enter into or maintain new contracts and other business relationships, on acceptable terms, if at all. The failure to maintain important business relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations as a combined company.\nThe growth of the combined company could suffer if the markets into which the combined company sells its products and services experience cyclicality.\nThe growth of the combined company will depend in part on the growth of the markets which the Communications Business serves. The Communications Business serves certain industries that have historically been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns that have had a material adverse impact on demand for the products, software and services that the Communications Business offers. Any of these factors could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company in any given period.\nDefects, quality issues, inadequate disclosure or misuse with respect to the products, software or services of the combined company could adversely affect the business, reputation and financial statements of the combined company.\nDefects in, quality issues with respect to or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of the combined company\u2019s products, software and services, or the misuse of the combined company\u2019s products, software and services, could lead to lost profits and other economic damage, property damage, violation of privacy rights, personal injury or other liability resulting in third party claims, criminal liability, significant costs, damage to its reputation and loss of business. Any of these factors could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company.\nInternational economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect the financial statements and growth of the combined company.\nThe Communications Business derives significant sales from customers outside the U.S. and certain manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees of the Communications Business are located outside the U.S. The Communications Business expects to continue to increase its sales and presence outside the U.S., particularly in the high-growth markets. The Communications Business\u2019 international business (and particularly its business in high-growth markets) is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, any of which could negatively affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company.\nRisks Related to the Company and its Operations\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate.\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Our quarterly revenue may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which may be outside of our control, including the following:\n\u2022\ntechnology spending by current and potential customers;\n\u2022\nuneven demand for service delivery and application performance management solutions;\n\u2022\nthe timing and size of orders from customers, especially in light of our lengthy sales cycle;\n\u2022\nthe timing and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing of hiring sales personnel and the speed at which such personnel become productive;\n\u2022\nour ability to anticipate or adapt effectively to developing markets and rapidly changing technologies and technology requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges in the number and size of our competitors and changes in the prices and capabilities of competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\ncustomer ability to implement our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nattrition of key employees; and\n\u2022\neconomic slowdowns and the occurrence of unforeseeable global events, which contribute to such slowdowns.\nMost of our expenses, such as employee compensation, benefits and rent, are relatively fixed in the short term. Moreover, our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future revenue levels. As a result, if revenue for a particular quarter is below our expectations, we may not be able to reduce operating expenses proportionately for that quarter, and, therefore, this revenue shortfall would have a disproportionately negative impact on our operating results for that quarter.\nIf we fail to introduce new products or enhance our existing products to keep up with rapid technological change, demand for our products may decline.\nThe market for application and network performance management and service assurance solutions is characterized by rapid changes in technology, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements and frequent product introductions and enhancements. Our success is dependent upon our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs, which are driven by changes in computer networking technologies, new application technologies and the emergence of new industry standards. In addition, new technologies may shorten the life cycle for our products or could render our existing or planned products obsolete. If we are unable to develop and introduce new network and application performance management and service assurance products or enhancements to existing products in a timely and successful manner, this inability could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe have introduced and intend to continue to introduce new products. If the introduction of these products is significantly delayed or if we are unsuccessful in bringing these products to market, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe face significant competition from other technology companies.\nThe service assurance and performance management market is a highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and fragmented market that has overlapping technologies and competitors, both large and small. We believe customers make service management system purchasing decisions based primarily upon the following factors:\n\u2022\nproduct performance, functionality and price;\n\u2022\ntimeliness of new product introductions;\n\u2022\nease of installation, integration, and use;\n\u2022\ncustomer service and technical support;\n\u2022\nname and reputation of vendor; and\n\u2022\nalliances with industry partners.\nWe compete with a growing number of providers of application performance management solutions and providers of portable network traffic analyzers and probes. In addition, leading network equipment and application technology vendors offer their own management solutions, including products which they license from other competitors. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, management, marketing, service, support, technical, distribution and other resources than we do. Further, in recent years some of our competitors have been acquired by larger companies that are seeking to enter or expand in the markets in which we operate. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in an evolving industry. Therefore, given their larger size and greater resources our competitors may be able to respond more effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards and customer requirements.\nAs a result of these and other factors, we may not be able to compete effectively with our current or future competitors. This competition could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses, and failure to increase, or the loss of, market share, any of which would likely have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to manage and leverage our distribution channels.\nSales to our distribution channels, which include resellers, original equipment manufacturers, distributors, systems integrators and service providers, accounted for 49%, 49%, and 49% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. To increase our sales we need to continue to enhance our indirect sales efforts, to continue to manage and expand these existing distribution channels and to develop new indirect distribution channels. Our channel partners have no obligation to purchase any products from us. In addition, they could internally develop products that compete with our solutions or partner with our competitors or bundle or resell competitors\u2019 solutions, possibly at lower prices. The potential inability to develop new relationships or to expand and manage our existing relationships with partners, the potential inability or unwillingness of our partners to market and sell our products effectively or the loss of existing partnerships could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our international operations, including our operations in the United Kingdom, mainland Europe, India, Asia-Pacific and other regions, are generally also subject to the risk of longer sales cycles through our international distribution channels. Sales to customers outside the United States accounted for 23%, 24%, and 25% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nIf our products contain errors, they may be costly to correct, revenue may be delayed, we could be sued and our reputation could be harmed.\nDespite testing by our customers and us, errors may be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments. If errors are discovered, we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner or at all. In addition, we may need to make significant expenditures to eliminate errors and failures. Errors and failures in our products could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation. If one or more of our products fail, a customer may assert warranty and other claims for substantial damages against us. The occurrence or discovery of these types of errors or failures could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIncreased customer demands on our technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.\nWe offer technical support services with many of our products. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors. Further customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must hire and retain skilled personnel, and plan for and manage the succession of key executives.\nOur future success depends in large part upon our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain highly skilled employees, particularly executives, sales and marketing personnel, software engineers, and technical support personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain the highly skilled technical personnel that are integral to our sales, marketing, product development and technical support teams, the rate at which we can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements may be limited. This inability could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we must maintain and periodically increase the size of our sales force in order to increase our direct sales and support our indirect sales channels. Because our products are very technical, sales people require a comparatively long period of time to become productive, typically three to twelve months. This lag in productivity, as well as the challenge of attracting qualified candidates, may make it difficult to meet our sales force growth targets. Further, we may not generate sufficient sales to offset the increased expense resulting from growing our sales force. If we are unable to maintain and periodically expand our sales capability, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted.\nLoss of key personnel could adversely impact our business. Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of Anil Singhal, our President, Chief Executive Officer, and co-founder, and our other key executive officers and senior managers to work effectively as a team. The loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. We must, therefore, plan for and manage the succession of key executives due to retirement, illness or competitive offers elsewhere.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on the continued growth in the market for and the continued commercial demand for service delivery service assurance solutions focused on the performance monitoring and management of applications and networks.\nWe derive nearly all of our revenue from the sale of products and services that are designed to allow our customers to assure the delivery of services through the management of the performance of applications across IP networks. Therefore, we must be able to predict the appropriate features and prices for future products to address the market, the optimal distribution strategy and the future changes to the competitive environment. In order for us to be successful, our potential customers must recognize the value of more sophisticated application management solutions, decide to invest in the management of their networked applications and, in particular, adopt our management solutions. Any failure of this market to continue to be viable would materially and adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, businesses may choose to outsource the operations and management of their networks to managed service providers. Our business may depend on our ability to continue to develop relationships with these service providers and successfully market our products to them.\nWe may not successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions we do make, which could impair our ability to compete and could harm our operating results.\nWe may need to acquire complementary businesses, products or technologies to remain competitive or expand our business. We actively investigate and evaluate potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, products and technologies in the ordinary course of business. We may compete for acquisition opportunities with entities having significantly greater resources than us. As a result, we may not succeed in acquiring some or all businesses, products or technologies that we seek to\nacquire. Our inability to effectively consummate acquisitions on favorable terms could significantly impact our ability to compete effectively in our targeted markets and could negatively affect our results of operations.\nAcquisitions that we do complete could adversely impact our business. The potential adverse consequences from acquisitions include:\n\u2022\nthe potentially dilutive issuance of common stock or other equity instruments;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to goodwill and acquired intangible assets;\n\u2022\nthe potentially costly and disruptive impact of assuming unfavorable pre-existing contractual relationships of acquired companies that we would not have otherwise entered into and potentially exiting or modifying such relationships;\n\u2022\nthe potential litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition including claims from terminated employees, customers, third parties or enforcement actions by various regulators;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of significant costs and expenses; and\n\u2022\nthe potentially negative impact of poor performance of an acquisition on our earnings per share.\nAcquisition transactions also involve numerous business risks. These risks from acquisitions include:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating the acquired operations, technologies, personnel and products;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating diverse financial reporting and management information systems;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nuse of cash to pay for acquisitions that may limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases and retirement of outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022\nsubstantial accounting charges for restructuring and related expenses, write-off of in-process research and development, impairment of goodwill, amortization or impairment of intangible assets and share-based compensation expense;\n\u2022\nthe potential disruption of our business;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors or suppliers;\n\u2022\nthe inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; and\n\u2022\nthe potential for delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with customers of the acquired businesses.\nFailure to manage growth properly and to implement enhanced automated systems could adversely impact our business.\nThe growth in size and complexity of our business and our customer base has been and will continue to be a challenge to our management and operations. To manage further growth effectively, we must integrate new personnel and manage expanded operations. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our costs, the quality of our products, the effectiveness of our sales organization, attraction and retention of key personnel, our business, our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted. Any disruptions or ineffectiveness relating to our systems implementations and enhancements could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders, ship products, provide services and support to our customers, bill and track our customers, fulfill contractual obligations, and otherwise run our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to manage our international research and development operations.\nWe must continue to enhance our existing products and introduce new products in order to keep up with rapid technological change. Our international research and development teams play a critical role in these efforts. We must attract, train, motivate and retain our international research and development team members. To maintain this stable international employee research and development talent, we believe we must provide our international engineers with compelling and strategically significant work, coupled with technical and architectural ownership of their respective development projects. We\nmust develop the leaders of these international teams, while ensuring their frequent inclusion and participation in corporate strategic and operational planning.\nIf we violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or applicable anti-bribery laws in other countries, or if we fail to comply with U.S. export controls and government contracting laws, our business could be harmed.\nWe earn a significant portion of our total revenues from international sales. As a result, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment and requires companies to maintain appropriate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect the transactions of the company. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for actions taken by agents or local partners or representatives. In addition, regulators may seek to hold us liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies which we acquire. We are also subject to the U.K. Bribery Act and may be subject to certain anti-corruption laws of other countries in which we do business. We are also subject to the export and re-export control laws of the U.S., including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR). We are also subject to U.S. government contracting laws, rules and regulations, and may be subject to government contracting laws of other countries in which we do business. If we or our distributors, resellers, agents, or other intermediaries fail to comply with the FCPA, the EAR or U.S. government contracting laws, or the anti-corruption, export or governmental contracting laws of other countries, governmental authorities in the U.S. or other countries could seek to impose civil and/or criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows.\nThe current economic and geopolitical environment may impact some specific industries into which we sell.\nMany of our customers are concentrated in certain industries, including financial services, public sector, healthcare, and the service provider market segment. Certain industries may be more acutely affected by economic, geopolitical and other factors than other sectors. Our public sector customers are affected by federal, state and local budget decisions. To the extent that one or more of the sectors in which our customer base operates is adversely impacted, whether as a result of general conditions affecting all sectors or as a result of conditions affecting only those particular sectors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.\nUncertain conditions in the global economy and constraints in the global credit market may adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nDisruptions in the global economy and constraints in the global credit market may cause some of our customers to reduce, delay, or cancel spending on capital and technology projects, resulting in reduced spending with us. While some industry sectors such as government and telecommunications may be less susceptible to the effects of an economic slowdown, our enterprise customers may be adversely affected, especially in financial services and consumer industries. Continued volatility in, or disruption of financial markets could limit customers\u2019 ability to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations and result in a decrease in sales volume that could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Further, competitors may respond to economic conditions by lowering their prices, which could put pressure on our pricing. We could also experience lower than anticipated order levels, cancellations of orders in backlog, defaults on outstanding accounts receivable and extended payment or delivery terms.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate with market volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Trading activity of our stock has historically been relatively thin, in part as a result of officers and directors and institutional stockholders holding a significant percentage of our stock. Broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, which in turn could cause impairment of goodwill that could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIt is not uncommon when the market price of a stock has been volatile for holders of that stock to institute securities class action litigation against the company that issues that stock. If any of our stockholders brought such a lawsuit against us, even if the lawsuit is without merit, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit beyond any insurance coverage which we may have for such risks. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management.\nWe may fail to secure necessary additional financing.\nOur future success may depend in part on our ability to obtain additional financing to support our continued growth and operations. If our existing sources of liquidity are insufficient to satisfy our operating requirements, we may need to seek to raise capital by:\n\u2022\nissuing additional common stock or other equity instruments;\n\u2022\nacquiring additional bank debt;\n\u2022\nissuing debt securities; or\n\u2022\nobtaining lease financings.\nHowever, we may not be able to obtain additional capital when we want or need it, or capital may not be available on satisfactory terms. Furthermore, any additional capital may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business, such as new financial or operating covenants, or that may result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nOur effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate, which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income.\nOur effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nChanges in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;\n\u2022\nChanging tax laws, regulations, and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings;\n\u2022\nChanges in accounting and tax treatment of share-based compensation;\n\u2022\nThe valuation of generated and acquired deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance on these assets;\n\u2022\nThe tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods; and\n\u2022\nTax assessments or any related tax interest or penalties that could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place.\nAn adverse change in our effective tax rate could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur estimates and judgments related to critical accounting policies could be inaccurate.\nWe consider accounting policies related to marketable securities, revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets and share-based compensation to be critical in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results. Management makes accounting judgments and estimates related to these policies. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods if our accounting judgments and estimates related to these critical accounting policies prove to be inaccurate.\nOur reliance on sole source suppliers could adversely impact our business.\nSpecific components that are necessary for the hardware assembly of our instruments are obtained from separate sole source suppliers or a limited group of suppliers. These components include our network interface cards and proprietary NetScout hardware. Our reliance on sole or limited suppliers involves several risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and the inability to exercise control over pricing, quality and timely delivery of components. It is our practice to mitigate these risks by partnering with key suppliers, including distributors, to establish a variety of supply continuity practices. These practices may include, among other approaches, establishing buffer supply requiring suppliers to maintain adequate stocks of materials, bonding agreements with distributors, and use-based and kanban programs to set supply thresholds. We also enter into escrow arrangements for certain technologies. Where possible, we use widely-available off the shelf hardware and work with large suppliers with multiple factories and other risk management practices. However, failure of supply or failure to execute effectively on any of these programs could result in our inability to obtain adequate deliveries or the occurrence of any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of these\ncomponents would impact our ability to ship our products on a timely basis. This could damage relationships with our current and prospective customers, cause shortfalls in expected revenue, and could materially and adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nNecessary licenses for third-party technology may not be available to us or may be very expensive.\nWe currently and will in the future license technology from third parties that we use to produce or embed in our products. While we have generally been able to license required third-party technology to date, future required third-party licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Third parties who hold exclusive rights to technology that we seek to license may include our competitors. If we are unable to obtain any necessary third-party licenses, we would be required to redesign our product or obtain substitute technology, which may not perform as well, be of lower quality or be more costly.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights.\nOur business is heavily dependent on our intellectual property. We rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and registrations and non-disclosure and other contractual and license arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. The reverse engineering, unauthorized copying, or other misappropriation of our intellectual property could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without compensating us. Legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of uncertainty. In addition, legal proceedings may divert management\u2019s attention from growing our business. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information, or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use by third parties and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. Further, we also license software from third parties for use as part of our products, and if any of these licenses were to terminate, we might experience delays in product shipment until we develop or license alternative software.\nOthers may claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights.\nFrom time to time we may be subject to claims by others that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights, patents, copyrights or trademarks. These claims, whether or not valid, could require us to spend significant sums in litigation, pay damages or royalties, delay product shipments, reengineer our products, rename our products and rebuild name recognition or acquire licenses to such third-party intellectual property. We may not be able to secure any required licenses on commercially reasonable terms or secure them at all. Any of these claims or resulting events could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe effectiveness of our disclosure and internal controls may be limited.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all material errors and intentional misrepresentations. Any system of internal control can only provide reasonable assurance that all control objectives are met. Some of the potential risks involved could include, but are not limited to, management judgments, simple errors or mistakes and willful misconduct regarding controls or misinterpretation. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with this legislation requires management\u2019s attention and expense. Management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting may or may not identify weaknesses that need to be addressed in our internal control system. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock or impact our borrowing ability. In addition, changes in operating conditions and changes in compliance with policies and procedures currently in place may result in inadequate internal control over financial reporting in the future.\nWe or our suppliers may be impacted by new regulations related to climate change.\nWe or our suppliers may become subject to new laws enacted with regards to climate change. In the event that new laws are enacted or current laws are modified in countries in which we or our suppliers operate, our flow of product may be impacted which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertainties of regulation of the Internet and data traveling over the Internet could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrently, few laws or regulations apply directly to access to or commerce on the Internet. We could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce in any country where we operate. Such regulations could include matters such as net neutrality. Further, governments may regulate or restrict the sales, licensing, distribution, and export or import of certain technologies to certain countries. The adoption of regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce could\ndecrease demand for our products and, at the same time, increase the cost of selling our products, which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the enactment of new federal, state, or foreign data privacy laws and regulations could cause customers not to be able to take advantage of all the features or capabilities of our products which in turn could reduce demand for certain of our products.\nIf a security breach or cyber attack of our IT networks and systems, or any of our products, occurs, our operations could be interrupted, our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable, and our brand and reputation could be damaged, which could reduce revenue, increase expenses, and expose us to legal claims or regulatory actions.\nAlthough we believe we have sufficient controls and security measures in place to prevent such attacks, our IT networks and systems, and our products, may still be vulnerable to data theft, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar problems. If we, or our customers using our products, were to experience a security breach or cyber attack, we could be required to incur substantial costs and liabilities, including but not limited to, expenses attributable to rectifying the security breach or cyber attack including the cost of repairing any damage to our, or our customers' systems, liability for stolen assets or information, lost revenue and income resulting from any system or product downtime, increased costs for cyber security protection, and damage to our reputation causing customers and possibly investors to lose confidence in us. Similarly, an actual or perceived breach of our customers\u2019 network security allowing access to our customers\u2019 data centers or other parts of their IT environments, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, may cause contractual disputes and could require significant expenditures of our capital and diversion of our resources from development efforts.", "PERMNO": 87179, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "NTCT"}
