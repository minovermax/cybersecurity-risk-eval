{"cik": "77776", "company": "PHH CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations, inquiries and proceedings, and we may incur fines, penalties, increased costs, and other consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows or damage our reputation.\nThere has been a heightened focus of regulators on the practices of the mortgage industry. Consistent with other mortgage originators and servicers, we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations, examinations, inquiries and proceedings from regulators and attorneys general of certain states as well as various governmental agencies, with respect to our mortgage lending and/or mortgage servicing practices. In addition, we are defendants in various legal proceedings, including private and civil litigation. For more information regarding our existing matters, see Note 14, 'Commitments and Contingencies' in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe are devoting substantial resources towards responding to litigation and regulatory investigations, examinations, inquiries and proceedings and have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, increasing costs with respect to these efforts. Our legal and regulatory matters are at varying procedural stages and the ultimate resolution of any of these matters may result in: (i) adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions and other relief against us, including, without limitation, payments made in settlement arrangements, monetary payments; (ii) enhanced compliance requirements; (iii) changes in our business processes, procedures or agreements; (iv) limitations on our ability to pursue business strategies; or (iv) other agreements and obligations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.\nOur business is complex and heavily regulated, and the full impact of regulatory developments to our business remains uncertain. Any failure of ours to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations or the terms of agreements with regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local government authorities and may be subject to various judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions on how we conduct our business. These laws, regulations and judicial and administrative decisions include those pertaining to: real estate settlement procedures; fair lending; fair credit reporting; truth in lending; compliance with federal and state disclosure and licensing requirements; the establishment of maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges; secured transactions; collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims-handling procedures; other trade practices; and privacy regulations providing for the use and safeguarding of non-public personal financial information of borrowers and guidance on non-traditional mortgage loans issued by the federal financial regulatory agencies. In addition, as an outcome of agreements or orders reached with government regulators, we may be subject to enhanced compliance monitoring, reporting requirements, changes to our business processes and procedures, and other agreements or obligations related to our origination and servicing activities. Further, by agreement with our private label clients we are required to comply with additional laws and regulations to which our clients may be subject. While we are not a bank, our private label business subjects us to both direct and indirect banking supervision (including examinations by our private label clients' regulators), and each private label client requires a unique compliance model, which creates complexities and potential inefficiencies in our operations.\nIn recent years, there have been a number of developments in laws and regulations and other financial reform legislation that have negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, our business and increase our risks of investigations, inquiries and proceedings. These developments include but are not limited to: (i) regulations from the Dodd-Frank Act; (ii) proposed changes to the infrastructures of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; (iii) increased vendor oversight obligations placed upon many of our private label clients by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and (iv) current rules proposed and adopted by the CFPB, including the implementation of changes to mortgage origination and settlement forms under the TILA-RESPA Integrated Mortgage Disclosure Rule, or TRID, which have required significant modifications and enhancements to our mortgage production processes and systems. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and of pending legislation in the U.S. Congress may impact the operation and practices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These changes could reduce or eliminate the government-sponsored entities\u2019 (\"GSEs\") ability to issue mortgage-backed securities, which would materially and adversely affect our business and could require us to fundamentally change our business model since we sold 62% of our loans in 2015 pursuant to GSE-sponsored programs.\nWe expect the higher legislative and regulatory focus on mortgage origination and servicing practices to continue to result in higher legal, compliance and servicing-related costs, heightened risk for potential regulatory fines, penalties, and actions required for injunctive relief, and such developments may result in limitations on our ability to pursue business strategies or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we conduct our business. Regulatory investigations, inquiries and proceedings all require\na significant amount of our time and resources to manage. The magnitude and complexity of our responses required to meet these demands requires the time and attention of our management, which poses a risk to achieving our business goals and priorities. Further, in our mortgage origination and servicing activities we are exposed to operational risk and events of non-compliance resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors, or external events. While we maintain and update our systems and procedures to comply with applicable laws and regulations and devote resources towards managing, assessing and reacting to developments, there can be no assurances that these measures will be effective or that changes will be implemented by the required deadlines.\nOur failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations or the terms of agreements with regulators could result in:\n\u2022\nloss of our approvals to engage in our origination and servicing businesses and/or other limitations on our ability to originate or service loans;\n\u2022\ngovernment investigations and enforcement actions;\n\u2022\nlitigation;\n\u2022\nan inability to execute on our business strategy;\n\u2022\nrequired payments of fines, penalties, settlements or judgments;\n\u2022\nthe loss of client relationships, including our private label and subservicing agreements, and/or our agreements with Realogy; and/or\n\u2022\ninability to fund our business, or otherwise operate our business.\nAny of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are highly dependent upon programs administered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae.\nOur ability to generate revenues in our Mortgage Production and Servicing segments is highly dependent on programs administered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae that facilitate the issuance of mortgage-backed securities in the secondary market. These entities play a powerful role in the residential mortgage industry, and we have significant business relationships with them, including:\nProduction. During 2015, 62% of our mortgage loan sales were sold to, or were sold pursuant to programs sponsored by, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. We also derive other material financial benefits from our relationships with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, which include the assumption of credit risk by these entities on loans included in mortgage-backed securities in exchange for our payment of guarantee fees, the ability to avoid certain loan inventory finance costs through streamlined loan funding and sale procedures and the use of mortgage warehouse facilities with Fannie Mae, pursuant to which, as of December 31, 2015, we had total capacity of $3.0 billion, with $500 million committed and $2.5 billion uncommitted.\nServicing. We service loans on behalf of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as loans that have been securitized pursuant to securitization programs sponsored by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. As of December 31, 2015, 55% of our mortgage servicing rights and loans serviced through subservicing agreements pertain to these programs. These entities establish the base service fee to compensate us for servicing loans as well as the assessment of fines and penalties that may be imposed upon us for failing to meet servicing standards.\nOur status as a Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae approved seller/servicer is subject to compliance with each entity\u2019s respective selling and servicing guidelines and failure to meet such guidelines could result in the unilateral termination of our status as an approved seller/servicer. Failure to maintain our relationship with each of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae would result in the termination of many of our agreements with our private label clients and otherwise would materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, changes in existing U.S. government-sponsored mortgage programs or servicing eligibility standards could require us to fundamentally change our business model in order to effectively compete in the market. Congress has held hearings and received reports outlining the long-term strategic plan for, and various options for long-term reform of the U.S. housing finance market, including changes designed to reduce government support for housing finance and the winding down of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae over a period of years. If enacted, this legislation or further regulation that curtails Freddie Mac and/or Fannie Mae\u2019s activities\nand/or results in the wind down of these entities could impact the pricing of mortgage related assets in the secondary market, result in higher mortgage rates to borrowers, and have a resulting negative impact on mortgage origination volumes and margins across the mortgage industry, any one of which could have a negative impact on our business. There is currently uncertainty with respect to the extent, if any, of such reform, and the long-term or short-term impacts of such changes on the housing market, and the related impacts on our operations. There can be no assurances whether we could timely and effectively change our business model in order to remain a competitive mortgage loan originator or servicer, and any such changes to the programs or GSEs may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe private label channel of our Mortgage Production segment has client-concentration risk related to the significant percentage of originations sourced from Merrill Lynch Home Loans, a division of Bank of America, National Association, Morgan Stanley Private Bank, N.A. and HSBC Bank USA. Any declines in the volume of loan originations sourced from these agreements, whether due to termination, non-renewal, or at the election of our counterparty, may materially and adversely impact our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nA significant percentage of originations in our private label business channel are sourced from a small number of client relationships, and this channel accounts for 75% of our total closings for the year ended December 31, 2015. In particular, 26% of our total originations were derived from Merrill Lynch Home Loans, a division of Bank of America, National Association, 20% from Morgan Stanley Private Bank, N.A. and 11% from HSBC Bank USA. None of these agreements contain minimum loan origination commitments. Substantial declines in origination volume sourced from our private label business channel would have a material and adverse impact on the Net revenues and Segment profit of our Mortgage Production segment, as well as our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are also subject to the risk of loss or non-renewal of certain of our private label client agreements, including Morgan Stanley which is scheduled to expire on October 31, 2016 and HSBC which is scheduled to expire on March 30, 2018, in each case unless such agreement is earlier terminated by the client at their convenience and upon payment of a termination fee. In addition, our agreement with Bank of America, National Association that governs our private label relationship with Merrill Lynch Home Loans expires on December 31, 2018, but may be canceled at any time at their convenience upon 180 days' notice. Further, these relationships may be terminated or not renewed, as a result of a variety of factors, including but not limited to our failure to fully satisfy our contractual obligations, or if we are not able to negotiate commercially reasonable terms upon renewal. The loss or non-renewal of our large private label client agreements may materially and adversely impact our mortgage loan originations and resulting Net revenues and Segment profit of our Mortgage Production segment as well as our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe real estate channel of our Mortgage Production segment is substantially dependent upon our relationship with Realogy, and the termination of our contractual agreements with Realogy would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRelationship with Realogy. We are party to a Strategic Relationship Agreement dated as of January 31, 2005 between PHH Mortgage, PHH Home Loans, PHH Broker Partner, Realogy Services Venture Partner Inc. and Cendant Corporation (now known as Avis Budget Group, Inc.). PHH Home Loans is a joint venture that was formed for the purpose of originating and selling mortgage loans that are primarily sourced from Realogy's owned real estate brokerage business. Under the Strategic Relationship Agreement, we are the exclusive recommended provider of mortgage loans to the independent sales associates affiliated with the real estate brokerage business owned and operated by Realogy\u2019s affiliates and certain customers of Realogy.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, 21% of our mortgage loan originations were derived from Realogy\u2019s affiliates, of which 91% were originated by PHH Home Loans. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015, PHH Home Loans originated residential mortgage loans of $7.9 billion, and PHH Home Loans brokered or sold $2.7 billion of mortgage loans to PHH Mortgage under the terms of a loan purchase arrangement.\nContractual Agreements. Unless terminated earlier, our relationship with Realogy continues until January 31, 2055. However, beginning on February 1, 2015 under the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement, Realogy has the right at any time to give us two years notice of its intent to terminate its interest in PHH Home Loans. In addition, the Strategic Relationship Agreement and the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement outline certain terms and events that would give Realogy the right to terminate the PHH Home Loans joint venture for cause. These terms and events include, but are not limited to, if:\n\u2022\nwe materially breach any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the Strategic Relationship Agreement or certain other related agreements, including, without limitation to, our confidentiality agreements in the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement, the PHH Home Loans Trademark License Agreement, and the Strategic Relationship Agreement, and our non-competition agreements in the Strategic Relationship Agreement that is not cured following any applicable notice or cure period;\n\u2022\nwe become subject to any regulatory order or governmental proceeding that prevents or materially impairs PHH Home Loans\u2019 ability to originate mortgage loans for any period of time (which order or proceeding is not generally applicable to companies in the mortgage lending business) in a manner that adversely affects the value of one or more of the quarterly distributions to be paid by PHH Home Loans pursuant to the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement;\n\u2022\nPHH Home Loans fails to make scheduled distributions pursuant to the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement; or\n\u2022\nthere is a change in control of us, PHH Broker Partner Corporation or any other affiliate of ours involving certain competitors or other specified parties.\nUpon a termination of the PHH Home Loans joint venture by Realogy or its affiliates (whether for cause or upon two years\u2019 notice without cause), Realogy will have the right either: (i) to require that we or certain of our affiliates purchase all of Realogy\u2019s interest in PHH Home Loans at the applicable purchase price set forth in the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement; or (ii) to cause us to sell our interest in PHH Home Loans at the applicable sale price set forth in the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement to an unaffiliated third party designated by certain of Realogy\u2019s affiliates. If we were required to purchase Realogy\u2019s interest in PHH Home Loans, such purchase could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. Additionally, any termination of the PHH Home Loans joint venture will also result in a termination of the Strategic Relationship Agreement, including our exclusivity rights thereunder and our other agreements and arrangements with Realogy. Any such termination would likely result in the loss of most, if not all, of our mortgage loan originations and Net revenues derived from Realogy\u2019s affiliates, which would have a material adverse effect on our overall business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nThe volume of our mortgage loan originations is subject to a variety of factors, which include the level of interest rates, overall conditions in the housing market, general economic trends and the marketing efforts of our clients and partners. We may not be able to grow our origination volume to or achieve our desired scale in our originations platform, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates and the level of interest rates are key drivers that impact the volatility of our mortgage loan originations in our Mortgage Production segment and mortgage loan refinancing activity, in particular. Historically, rising interest rates have generally been associated with a lower volume of loan originations and lower pricing margins in our Mortgage Production segment due to a disincentive for borrowers to refinance at a higher interest rate, while falling interest rates have generally been associated with higher loan originations and higher pricing margins, due to an incentive for borrowers to refinance at a lower interest rate. The level of market interest rates are significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the federal government, its agencies and government sponsored entities, which are particularly affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board that regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. The Federal Reserve Board\u2019s policies can affect the size of the mortgage loan origination market, the pricing of our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in any of these policies are beyond our control, difficult to predict, particularly in the current economic environment, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.\nIn addition, mortgage loan origination volume is also subject to other market factors that can impact our ability to grow our mortgage production volume. Competitive pressures from new and existing market participants, the level and composition of new and existing home purchase activity, the health of the overall economy or reductions in the overall level of refinancing activity can impact our ability to grow our loan origination volume, or can impact the total loan margin resulting from originating and selling loans into the secondary market. Our ability to generate Gain on loans held for sale, net in our Mortgage Production segment is significantly dependent on our level of saleable mortgage loan originations and the levels of total loan margin. Increases in interest rates could adversely affect our mortgage loan origination volume, which could have a material and adverse effect on our Mortgage Production segment, as well as our overall business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.\nThe profitability of our Mortgage Servicing segment has been adversely affected by increased costs to service and declines in our capitalized servicing portfolio. Despite these increases in costs, the revenue received for mortgage servicing activities has remained constant for holders of mortgage servicing rights. There can be no assurances that our mortgage servicing rights asset will yield its modeled value, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.\nSince the implementation of new servicing rules and guidelines as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, costs to service performing and delinquent loans have significantly increased over the past five years, which has negatively impacted the results of our Servicing segment. Evolving regulatory changes have increased the cost of compliance with no commensurate change in the servicing compensation earned for our owned servicing portfolio. Further, our compensation as servicer for 55% of our total servicing portfolio (as of December 31, 2015) is driven by the standards defined by the Agencies. While we are monitoring various proposals for servicing compensation reform over the longer term, we have focused on evaluating the composition of our servicing portfolio\nand the underlying expense drivers in the near term to improve profitability. There can be no assurances that the revenue from the capitalized portfolio will exceed our total costs to service in the short term, or that the mortgage servicing rights asset will yield its modeled value over the longer term.\nWe have also implemented a strategy to shift the mix of our servicing portfolio to a greater mix of subserviced loans. To execute this strategy, we have entered into agreements to sell a portion of our newly-created Mortgage servicing rights to third parties, where we will have continuing involvement as subservicer. While we expect this strategy to have longer-term benefits, in the short term it should result in a reduced capitalized portfolio with lower Mortgage Servicing segment profit that would eventually be offset by a higher return on equity in the Mortgage Servicing segment. This strategy may result in a lower replenishment of prepayments and amortization with newly originated servicing rights as well as the increased risk associated with subservicing relationships, as the terms of a substantial portion of our subservicing agreements allow the owners of the servicing to terminate the subservicing agreement without cause. If we were to have our subservicing agreements terminated on a material portion of our subservicing portfolio, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with changes in interest rates.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk and related price risk for many of our assets, including interest rate lock commitments, mortgage loans held for sale and mortgage servicing rights. Interest rate lock commitments generally range between 30 and 90 days, and we typically sell mortgage loans within 30 days of origination. The fair value of our mortgage servicing rights is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates, as borrower prepayment patterns are driven by the relative changes in mortgage interest rates. Historically, the value of our mortgage servicing rights have increased when interest rates rise and have decreased when interest rates decline due to the effect those changes in interest rates have on prepayment estimates, with changes in fair value of our mortgage servicing rights being included in our consolidated results of operations. Our consolidated financial positions, results of operations and cash flows are susceptible to significant volatility due to changes in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights as interest rates change. In addition, changes in interest rates may require us to post additional collateral under certain of our financing arrangements and derivative agreements which could impact our liquidity.\nWe may employ various economic hedging strategies in an attempt to mitigate the interest rate and prepayment risk inherent in many of our assets, including our mortgage loans held for sale, interest rate lock commitments and our mortgage servicing rights. Our hedging activities include entering into derivative instruments, such as forward delivery commitments on mortgage backed-securities or whole loans, futures, and option contracts. We also seek to manage interest rate risk partially without the use of financial derivatives by monitoring and seeking to maintain an appropriate balance between our loan production volume and the size of our capitalized portfolio associated with mortgage servicing rights, as the value of mortgage servicing rights and the income they provide tend to be counter-cyclical to the changes in production volumes and the gain or loss on loans that result from changes in interest rates. This approach requires our management to make assumptions with regards to future replenishment rates for our mortgage servicing rights, loan margins, the value of additions to our mortgage servicing rights and loan origination costs, and many factors can impact these estimates, including loan pricing margins and our ability to adjust staffing levels to meet changing consumer demand. Our decisions regarding the levels and composition of derivatives related to mortgage servicing rights could result in continued volatility in the results of operations for our Mortgage Servicing segment.\nOur hedging strategies, including our decisions whether to use derivative instruments to hedge our Mortgage servicing rights, may not be effective in mitigating the risks related to changes in interest rates, and we may not have sufficient liquidity to exercise our strategies. There have been periods, and it is likely that there will be periods in the future, during which we incur significant losses as a result of our hedging strategies.\nOur hedging strategies also rely on assumptions and projections regarding our assets and general market factors. If these assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes including, but not limited to, interest rates or prepayment speeds, we may incur losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive, and many of our competitors have access to greater financial resources, lower funding costs and greater access to funding sources, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of economic, legislative, regulatory or technological changes. Competition for mortgage loan originations comes primarily from commercial banks and savings institutions, as well as non-bank mortgage originators. Many of our competitors for mortgage loan originations that are commercial banks or savings institutions typically have access to greater financial resources, have more diverse funding sources with lower funding costs, are less reliant than we are on the sale of mortgage loans into the secondary markets to maintain their liquidity, and may be able to participate in government programs that we are unable to participate in because we are not a state or federally\nchartered depository institution, all of which places us at a competitive disadvantage. Further, since we are not a state or federally chartered depository institution, we must comply with the licensing and regulatory requirements of states and other jurisdictions, we may incur increased compliance costs, and we are subject to increased compliance and regulatory risks than many of our competitors.\nOther advantages of our largest competitors include, but are not limited to, their ability to hold new mortgage loan originations in an investment portfolio and their access to lower rate bank deposits as a source of liquidity. Additionally, more restrictive loan underwriting standards and the widespread elimination of certain non-conforming mortgage products throughout the industry have resulted in a more homogeneous product offering, which has increased competition across the industry for mortgage originations.\nRisks Related to Our Strategies\nOur continuing operations have not been profitable over the past two years, and we have taken certain actions, and intend to implement further strategies, to improve our operating results. We may not be able to fully or successfully execute or implement our business strategies or achieve our objectives, and our actions taken may not have the intended result.\nIn 2015, we have taken steps to re-engineer our business towards improving our results of operations, including executing amendments to agreements with our private label clients and completing planned cost reduction actions. While we expect that the combination of those actions will result in up to $225 million annualized operating benefits, there can be no assurances that we will realize the full impact of the projected benefits or that these efforts will achieve the intended results.\nFurther, we have developed strategies and we expect to take further actions to achieve sustained profitability, which may include, but are not limited to: (i) growing our market share in the retail home purchase market through our PHH Home Loans joint venture relationship; (ii) evaluating, and potentially executing, further changes to our private label services business model to offset the increasing cost structure; and (iii) completing acquisitions to achieve inorganic growth and scale. There can be no assurances that we will execute these actions, or that the execution of these actions will achieve the intended results. The achievement of our goals is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally (including market, credit, operational, and legal and compliance risks) and the inherent difficulty associated with implementing these strategic objectives. Furthermore, our success is dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our management team and our ability to negotiate with third parties. We are continuing to consider alternatives to our business strategies, which may include considering acquisitions or sales of assets, exiting certain business lines, and other transformative actions that could include the sale of all or portions of our business.\nOur strategy to achieve growth through acquisitions is subject to both the risks inherent in exploring or executing acquisitions, as well as risks specific to our business and industry.\nOur strategy to achieve growth in the retail origination market through acquisitions is an important part of our current plans to achieve scale and improve our results of operations. We may fail to identify an acquisition target, or if identified, may not succeed in completing and integrating such acquisition. Further, even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, we may not have sufficient capital to fund acquisitions, be able to execute transactions on favorable terms, or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we are seeking. Such an acquisition is subject to general execution risk, but also the acquisition of a retail origination platform has increased integration risks related to the retention of personnel, organizational culture and fit, and other difficulties in the assimilation of the operations and technologies of the acquired entity. Also, depending on the nature of our acquisition, our desired acquisition may be subject to regulatory approval, and our ability to complete the acquisition may be limited.\nThere can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions or other inorganic growth opportunities. The exploration or consummation of any acquisition could consume significant financial resources and result in significant expenses being incurred that may not have been incurred had such activities not been undertaken. Should we make an error in judgment when identifying an acquisition candidate, should the new relationship or acquired assets not perform as anticipated, or should we fail to successfully execute on the new relationship or integrate the acquired business, we will likely fail to realize the benefits we intended to derive from the acquisition and may suffer other adverse consequences. Further, pursuing an acquisition could divert management\u2019s attention towards, and financial resources from, the goals and operations of our existing business and our other strategic priorities.\nWe are subject to inherent risks associated with the sale of our Fleet business, including risks associated with our liabilities under the related agreements and with our tax position, and we could be exposed to losses or liabilities in the future in connection with the sale.\nThe sale of our Fleet business was completed in 2014, and in connection with the sale, we have agreed to indemnify Element Financial Corporation (\u201cElement\u201d) for a breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty or covenant made by us in the purchase agreement, for any liability of ours that is not being assumed, for any claims by our stockholders against Element and for certain additional customary contingencies related to the purchase and sale agreement. Such indemnification terms generally survive through March 31, 2016, subject to certain exceptions. Significant indemnification claims by Element could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn connection with tax amounts recorded related to the sale of the Fleet business, we assumed certain tax positions that, if not withheld under audit, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the payment of additional tax amounts, penalties and interest, or other negative consequences. Such indemnifications for taxes survive until 30 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, or, with respect to any non-United States tax amounts, July 2021.\nLiquidity Risks\nOur mortgage asset-backed debt arrangements, a significant portion of which are short-term agreements, are an important source of our liquidity. If any of our funding arrangements are terminated, not renewed or otherwise become unavailable to us, we may be unable to find replacement financing on economically viable terms, if at all. If a substantial portion of such arrangements are terminated, not renewed, and cannot be replaced, it would adversely affect our ability to fund our operations.\nOur mortgage asset-backed debt arrangements are an important source of liquidity for our origination and servicing activities:\nMost of our mortgage warehouse facilities mature within one year, and generally, these facilities require us to maintain a specified amount of available funding from other facilities. As such, our liquidity profile and compliance with debt covenants depends on our ability to renew multiple facilities within a short time frame. Our access to and our ability to renew our existing mortgage warehouse facilities is subject to prevailing market conditions, and could suffer in the event of: (i) the deterioration in the performance of the mortgage loans underlying the warehouse facilities; (ii) our failure to maintain sufficient levels of eligible assets or credit enhancements or comply with other terms of the facilities; (iii) our inability to access the secondary market for mortgage loans; and (iv) termination of our role as servicer of the underlying mortgage assets.\nOur servicing advance funding facility, PHH Servicer Advance Receivables Trust (\u201cPSART\u201d), is a special purpose bankruptcy remote trust formed for purposes of issuing non-recourse asset-backed notes secured by servicing advance receivables. Our ability to maintain liquidity through issuing asset-backed notes secured by servicing advance receivables is dependent on many factors, including but not limited to: (i) market demand for ABS, specifically ABS collateralized by mortgage servicing-related receivables; (ii) our ability to service in accordance with applicable guidelines and the quality of our servicing, both of which will impact noteholders\u2019 willingness to commit to financing for an additional term; and (iii) our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to us.\nLenders' interest in funding mortgage asset-backed facilities may be impacted by changes in such lenders' regulatory environment and capital requirements or by other changes in such lenders' strategies and lines of business. As a result, we may be exposed to a general decline in lender interest, resulting in fewer counterparties with which we may seek such facilities. If a substantial portion of the committed capacity of our facilities are terminated or are not renewed, we may be unable to find replacement financing on commercially favorable terms, if at all, which could adversely impact our operations and prevent us from executing our business plan, originating new mortgage loans or fulfilling commitments made in the ordinary course of business. These factors could reduce revenues attributable to our business activities or require us to sell assets at below market prices, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our overall business and consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our debt arrangements require us to comply with specific financial covenants and other affirmative and restrictive covenants, termination events, conditions precedent to borrowing, and other restrictions, including, but not limited to, those relating to material adverse changes, our consolidated net worth, liquidity, and restrictions on our indebtedness. An uncured default of one or more of these covenants could result in a cross-default between and amongst our various debt arrangements, including our unsecured term debt. Consequently, an uncured default that is not waived by our lenders and that results in an acceleration of amounts payable to our lenders or the termination of credit facilities would materially and adversely impact our liquidity, could\nforce us to sell assets at below market prices to repay our indebtedness, and could force us to seek relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In addition, certain of our mortgage warehouse arrangements contain borrowing conditions under which our adjusted net income (excluding certain changes in value of mortgage servicing rights and related derivatives) must be $1.00 or more for the quarterly measurement period that must be met in order for us to borrow under the facility. Our inability to satisfy this condition would not result in an event of default but would relieve the lender of its funding commitment, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations.\nWe may be limited in our ability to obtain or renew financing in the unsecured credit markets on economically viable terms or at all, due to our senior unsecured long-term debt ratings being below investment grade and due to our history of reported losses from continuing operations since becoming a standalone mortgage company.\nOur senior unsecured long-term debt ratings are below investment grade and, as a result, our access to the public debt markets may be severely limited in comparison to the ability of investment grade issuers to access such markets. In addition, our historical results of operations have included the operations of the Fleet Management Services segment, which had provided a consistent source of income and cash flows for our business. After the completion of the sale, our access to the credit markets may be more limited than our historical experience, or we may be unable to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Further, we have experienced several quarters of operating losses since the disposition of the Fleet business, and we are continuing our efforts to re-engineer our business to achieve profitability.\nIn order to obtain financing in the future, we may be required to rely on alternative financing, such as bank lines and private debt placements, and may also be required to pledge otherwise unencumbered assets. Furthermore, our cost of financing could rise significantly, thereby negatively impacting our financial results. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to further ratings actions: (i) if our business and financial results deteriorate significantly or do not show improvement over an acceptable period of time; (ii) if we are unable to put in place sources of liquidity to fund our business satisfactory to the rating agencies; and/or (iii) based upon regulatory reviews, investigations, proceedings or other claims and enforcement actions that result in material monetary exposures and/or other negative consequences, among other factors. We cannot predict the impact any further negative debt ratings actions may have on our cost of capital, on our ability to incur new indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness or on our ability to retain or secure customers.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe are not required to complete any future repurchases of our Common stock, and any such repurchases may not result in effects we anticipated.\nWe have authorizations from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to an additional $150 million of our Common stock through December 31, 2016 through an open market repurchase program. There can be no assurances that we will commence further repurchases, and if commenced, we are not obligated to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. The timing and amount of any further repurchases, if any, will depend on several factors, including market and business conditions, the market price of our Common stock and our overall capital structure and liquidity position, including the nature of other potential uses of cash, including investments in growth.\nIn addition, if effected, there can be no assurances that our stock repurchase program will have the effects we anticipated. Repurchases of our common stock could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The completion of any further share repurchases will utilize cash that we will not be able to use in other ways, whether to grow the business or otherwise.\nA change in control transaction may result in a number of significant cash outflows that could reduce the value of our business. Further, the provisions of certain of our agreements could discourage third parties from seeking to acquire us, or could prevent or delay a transaction resulting in a change of control.\nThe net proceeds realized by our shareholders as the result of any change in control transaction or a fundamental change, may be negatively impacted as a result of required payments under our corporate term debt, certain tax impacts or the potential termination of certain client relationships (if consents or waivers are not obtained), among other consequences.\nThe terms of certain of our Senior note agreements and indentures contain provisions that require us to offer to repurchase, for cash, all or a portion of the outstanding notes upon a change of control, as defined in such indentures. Further, a change of control may constitute an event of default under certain of our debt agreements, including our mortgage warehouse facilities.\nWe may need to obtain consents or waivers from the GSEs, state licensing agencies and certain clients or counterparties, in connection with certain change in control transactions. Additionally, the value of our business could be reduced from any lost relationships and/or loss of our approved status as a Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae approved seller/servicer in connection with certain change in control transactions. Our agreements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac require us to provide notice or obtain approvals or consents related to any change in control transaction. Our agreements with Realogy, including the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement, state that Realogy may terminate PHH Home Loans if we effect a change in control transaction involving certain competitors or other third parties. In connection with such termination, we may be required to make a cash payment to Realogy in an amount equal to PHH Home Loans\u2019 trailing 12 months net income multiplied by two.\nIn addition, agreements with some of our financial institution clients governing our private label relationships provide our clients with the right to terminate their relationship with us if we complete certain change in control transactions with certain third parties. The need to obtain waivers or consents from our clients in connection with a change in control transaction may discourage certain third parties from seeking to acquire us or could reduce the amount of consideration they would be willing to pay to our stockholders in an acquisition transaction, or could otherwise reduce the value of the business when separated.\nProvisions in our charter documents, the Maryland General Corporation Law, and New York insurance law may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party.\nOur charter and by-laws contain several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions include, among other things, advance notice for raising business or making nominations at meetings and \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. Blank check preferred stock enables our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to designate and issue additional series of preferred stock with such dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, including the right to issue convertible securities with no limitations on conversion, as our board of directors may determine, including rights to dividends and proceeds in a liquidation that are senior to the Common stock.\nWe are also subject to certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law which could delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their Common stock or may otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. These include, among other provisions:\n\u25aa\nthe \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d statute which prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder and\n\u25aa\nthe \u201ccontrol share\u201d acquisition statute which provides that control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.\nOur by-laws contain a provision exempting any share of our capital stock from the control share acquisition statute to the fullest extent permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law. However, our Board of Directors has the exclusive right to amend our by-laws and, subject to their fiduciary duties, could at any time in the future amend the by-laws to remove this exemption provision.\nIn addition, we are registered as an insurance holding company in the state of New York as a result of our wholly owned subsidiary, Atrium Insurance Corporation. New York insurance law requires regulatory approval of a change in control of an insurer or an insurer\u2019s holding company. Accordingly, there can be no effective change in control of us unless the person seeking to acquire control has filed a statement containing specified information with the New York state insurance regulators and has obtained prior approval. The measure for a presumptive change of control pursuant to New York law is the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting stock or other ownership interest of an insurance company or its parent. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of us, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable.\nOther Risks\nOur financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates made by our management, including those used in determining the fair values of a substantial portion of our assets. If the assumptions or estimates are subsequently proven incorrect or inaccurate, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nPursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we utilize certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including but not limited to, when determining the fair values of certain assets and liabilities, accruals related to litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, and reserves related to mortgage representations and warranty claims. If the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience significant losses as the ultimate realization of value may be materially different than the amounts reflected in our consolidated statement of financial position as of any particular date.\nFor additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing our financial statements, see \u201cPart II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d in this Form 10K.\nFair Value. A substantial portion of our assets are recorded at fair value based upon significant estimates and assumptions with changes in fair value included in our consolidated results of operations. As of December 31, 2015, 45% of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including $880 million of assets representing our Mortgage servicing rights which are valued using significant unobservable inputs and management\u2019s judgment of the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset. The determination of the fair value of our assets involves numerous estimates and assumptions made by our management. Such estimates and assumptions include, without limitation, estimates of future cash flows associated with our mortgage servicing rights based upon model inputs involving interest rates as well as the prepayment rates and delinquencies and foreclosure rates of the underlying serviced mortgage loans. The use of different estimates or assumptions in connection with the valuation of these assets could produce materially different fair values, or our fair value estimates may not be realized in an actual sale or settlement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nLegal and Regulatory Contingencies. Accruals are established for pending or threatened litigation, claims or assessments when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. In light of the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation and other legal proceedings, it is not always possible to determine a reasonable estimate of the amount of a probable loss, and we may estimate a range of possible loss for consideration in these estimates. The estimates are based upon currently available information and involve significant judgment taking into account the varying stages and inherent uncertainties of such matters. Accordingly, our estimates may change from time to time and such changes may be material to our consolidated results of operations. There can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of such matters will not result in losses in excess of our recorded accruals, or in excess of our estimate of reasonably possible losses, and the ultimate settlement of such matters may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRepresentations and Warranties. In connection with the sale of mortgage loans, we make various representations and warranties that, if breached, require us to repurchase the loans or indemnify the purchaser for actual losses incurred in respect of such loans. The estimation of our loan repurchase and indemnification liability requires subjective and complex judgments, and incorporates key assumptions that are impacted by both internal and external factors. Internal factors include, but are not limited to, the level of loan sales and origination volumes, and the quality of our underwriting procedures. External factors include, but are not limited to: (i) the political environment and oversight of the Agencies, and related changes in Agency programs and guidelines; (ii) borrower delinquency levels and default patterns; (iii) home price values and (iv) the overall economic condition of borrowers and the U.S. economy.\nFurther, a significant amount of our exposure to representation and warranty claims relates to loans that are subject to a new representation framework for conventional loans. The full impact of our future loss experience under the new framework remains uncertain, and we will continue to refine our loss estimates as we monitor our experience with file reviews and claims under the new framework. There can be no assurance that we will not realize losses in excess of our recorded reserves, or in excess of our estimate of reasonably possible losses, and that such losses may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur reliance on outsourcing arrangements for information technology services subjects us to significant business process and control risks due to the complexity of our information systems or if our outsourcing counterparties do not meet their obligations to us.\nWe entered into an arrangement to outsource our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) services to a third party as part of an effort to reduce costs and obtain operational benefits. Entering into an outsourcing arrangement for IT services subjects us to significant business process and control risks. If our outsource partner fails to perform their obligations under the terms of the agreement, or if our management of this vendor is not successful, we are subject to operational risk from our IT environment. We are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems which we use to interface with our customers, to maintain compliance with applicable regulations and to manage our internal financial and other systems. Our business model and our reputation as a service provider to our clients, as well as our internal controls over financial reporting, are highly dependent upon these systems and processes. In addition, our ability to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations is dependent on our technology infrastructure.\nAlthough we have service-level arrangements with our counterparties, we do not ultimately control their performance, which may make our operations vulnerable to their performance failures. Any failures in our technology systems, processes or the related internal and operational controls, or the failure of our outsourcing providers to perform as expected or as contractually required could result in the loss of client relationships, damage to our reputation, failures to comply with regulations, failure to prepare our financial statements in a timely and accurate manner, and increased costs, the result of any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nA failure in or breach of our technology infrastructure or information protection programs, or those of our outsource providers, could result in the inadvertent disclosure of the confidential personal information of our customers, as well as the confidential personal information of the customers of our clients. Any such failure or breach, including as a result of cyber-attacks against us or our outsource partners, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nOur business model and our reputation as a service provider to our clients are dependent upon our ability to safeguard the confidential personal information of our customers, as well as the confidential personal information of the customers of our clients. Although we have put in place, and require our outsource providers to follow, a comprehensive information security program that we monitor and update as needed, security breaches could occur through intentional or unintentional acts by individuals having authorized or unauthorized access to confidential information of our customers or the employees or customers of our clients which could potentially compromise confidential information processed and stored in or transmitted through our technology infrastructure. In addition, we have highly complex information systems, certain portions of which we are dependent upon third party outsource providers and other portions of which are self-developed and for which third party support is not generally available.\nA failure in or breach of the security of our information systems, or those of our outsource providers, or a cyber-attack against us or our outsource partners, could result in significant damage to our reputation or the reputation of our clients, could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain clients and could result in increased costs attributable to related litigation or regulatory actions, claims for indemnification, higher insurance premiums and remediation activities, the result of any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.", "PERMNO": 90531, "SIC": 6162, "TIC": "PHH"}
