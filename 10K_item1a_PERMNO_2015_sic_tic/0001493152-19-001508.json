RISK FACTORS\nThe following is a discussion of the primary factors that may affect the operations and/or financial performance of our business. Refer to the section entitled Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report for an additional discussion of these and other related factors that affect our operations and/or financial performance.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have incurred significant net losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve or maintain profitable operations.\nTo date, we have not generated any significant revenues from our operations and have incurred losses since inception. Our net loss was $12,127,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $7,266,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, we had stockholders\u2019 deficit of $5,055,000. We may continue to incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays, and other unknown events.\nWe anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we undertake increased technology and production efforts to support our business and increase our marketing and sales efforts to drive an increase in the number of customers and clients utilizing our services. These expenditures may make it more difficult to achieve and maintain profitability. In addition, our efforts to grow our business may be more expensive than we expect, and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to offset increased operating expenses. If we are forced to reduce our expenses, our growth strategy could be compromised. To offset these anticipated increased operating expenses, we will need to generate and sustain significant revenue levels in future periods in order to become profitable, and, even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase our level of profitability.\nAccordingly, we cannot assure you that we will achieve sustainable operating profits as we continue to expand our infrastructure, restructure our balance sheet, further develop our marketing efforts, and otherwise implement our growth initiatives. Any failure to achieve and maintain profitability would have a materially adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan, our results and operations, and our financial condition, and could cause the value of our Common Stock, to decline, resulting in a significant or complete loss of your investment.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s reports for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 have raised substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d\nOur independent registered public accounting firm indicated in its report on our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. A \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion indicates that the financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result if we do not continue as a going concern. Therefore, you should not rely on our consolidated balance sheet as an indication of the amount of proceeds that would be available to satisfy claims of creditors, and potentially be available for distribution to stockholders, in the event of liquidation. The presence of the going concern note to our financial statements may have an adverse impact on the relationships we are developing and plan to develop with third parties as we continue the commercialization of our products and could make it challenging and difficult for us to raise additional financing, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects and result in a significant or complete loss of your investment.\nOur ability to grow and compete in the future will be adversely affected if adequate capital is not available to us or not available on terms favorable to us.\nWe have limited capital resources. To date, we have financed our operations entirely through equity investments by founders and other investors and the incurrence of debt, and we expect to continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Our ability to continue our normal and planned operations, to grow our business, and to compete in our industry will depend on the availability of adequate capital.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funding from those or other sources when or in the amounts needed, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise capital through the sale of equity, or securities convertible into equity, it would result in dilution to our then-existing stockholders, which could be significant depending on the price at which we may be able to sell our securities. If we raise additional capital through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we would likely become subject to further covenants restricting our business activities, and holders of debt instruments may have rights and privileges senior to those of our then-existing stockholders. In addition, servicing the interest and principal repayment obligations under debt facilities could divert funds that would otherwise be available to support development of new programs and marketing to current and potential new clients. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate development of new programs or future marketing efforts, or reduce or discontinue our operations. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition, and prospects.\nOur business depends on customers increasing their use of our services and/or platform, and we may experience loss of customers or decline in their use of our services and/or platform.\nOur ability to grow and generate revenue depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and grow our relationships with existing customers and convince them to increase their usage of our platform. If our customers do not increase their use of our platform, then our revenue may not grow and our results of operations may be harmed. It is difficult to predict customers\u2019 usage levels accurately and the loss of customers or reductions in their usage levels may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If a significant number of customers cease using, or reduce their usage of, our platform, then we may be required to spend significantly more on sales and marketing than we currently plan to spend in order to maintain or increase revenue from customers. These additional expenditures could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Most of our customers do not have long-term contractual financial commitments to us and, therefore, most of our customers could reduce or cease their use of our platform at any time without penalty or termination charges.\nThe market in which we operate is dominated by large, well established competitors.\nThe CRM industry is currently dominated by Salesforce.com, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP SE, and Adobe, which collectively account for approximately 40% of industry sales. The CRM applications offered by these companies, as well as by many others, have numerous differences in feature sets and functionality, but all share certain basic attributes. Most of them were designed before the advent and proliferation of mobile phones, social media, and the technology behind the current ubiquity of video over the internet and more recently on mobile devices. While many of our competitors have attempted to incorporate video capabilities into their respective CRM platforms, none of them utilize interactive video technology similar to that of ours. In addition, our Tagg interactive videos are viewable on both mobile and desktop devices regardless of operating system and without the need to download a proprietary player or program.\nThe market in which we operate is intensely competitive and, if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe market for CRM applications is intensely competitive and rapidly changing, barriers to entry are relatively low, many of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do, and, with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. If we fail to compete effectively, our operating results will be harmed.\nNotwithstanding the competitive edge that we believe our Tagg interactive video capability provides our CRM applications, many of our competitors enjoy other substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources. In addition, many of our potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators, and resellers.\nAs a result, our competitors may be able to respond more effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or customer requirements. Furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our products and services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our products and services. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors\nWe may not be able to increase the number of our partners or grow the revenues received from our current partnership relationships.\nThe differences between our Tagg interactive video CRM applications and many of the larger, more established providers of CRM software may serve to highlight the reasons we have chosen not only to develop our own stand-alone SaaS cloud CRM platform, but also to incorporate and integrate our interactive video technology into the platforms of many of these large, long-term leaders in the CRM industry. This allows them to offer Tagg interactive video capabilities to their large enterprise clients and customers as an upgrade feature to their CRM platform subscriptions. The viability of this strategy is evidenced by the partnerships we currently enjoy with Oracle NetSuite and Adobe Marketo, as well as new partnerships with Salesforce.com. and Microsoft, among others. There can be no assurance, however, that those relationships will result in material revenues for us or that we will be able to generate any other meaningful partnerships.\nWe may not be able to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments.\nEven though we believe that our Tagg interactive video CRM applications are currently unsurpassed in features and ease of use, technology invariably advances. If we are unable to develop enhancements to, and new features for, our Tagg interactive video CRM applications that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features, and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of the feature or edition. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market at a competitive price or at all. Furthermore, notwithstanding that our Tagg interactive videos are currently viewable on both mobile and desktop devices regardless of operating system, potential uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction, and harm our business.\nOur ability to deliver our services is dependent on the maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet by third parties.\nThe Internet\u2019s infrastructure is comprised of many different networks and services that, by design, are highly fragmented and distributed. This infrastructure is run by a series of independent, third-party organizations that work together to provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the Internet under the governance of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Numbers and Names (ICANN) and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which is now related to ICANN.\nThe Internet has experienced, and will continue to experience, a variety of outages and other delays due to damages to portions of its infrastructure, denial-of-service attacks, or related cyber incidents. These scenarios are not under our control and could reduce the availability of the Internet to us or our customers for delivery of our services. Any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. The secure processing, maintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Advanced attacks are multi-staged, unfold over time, and utilize a range of attack vectors with military-grade cyber weapons and proven techniques, such as spear phishing and social engineering, leaving organizations and users at high risk of being compromised. The vast majority of data breaches, whether conducted by a cyber attacker from inside or outside of the organization, involve the misappropriation of digital identities and user credentials. These credentials are used to gain legitimate access to sensitive systems and high-value personal and corporate data. Many large, well-known organizations have been subject to cyber-attacks that exploited the identity vector, demonstrating that even organizations with significant resources and security expertise have challenges securing their identities. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, a disruption of our operations, damage to our reputation, or a loss of confidence in our business, any of which could adversely affect our business, revenues, and competitive position.\nOrganizations face growing regulatory and compliance requirements.\nNew and evolving regulations and compliance standards for cyber security, data protection, privacy, and internal IT controls are often created in response to the tide of cyber-attacks and will increasingly impact organizations. Existing regulatory standards require that organizations implement internal controls for user access to applications and data. In addition, data breaches are driving a new wave of regulation, such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, with stricter enforcement and higher penalties. Regulatory and policy-driven obligations require expensive and time-consuming compliance measures. The fear of non-compliance, failed audits, and material findings has pushed organizations to spend more to ensure they are in compliance, often resulting in costly, one-off implementations to mitigate potential fines or reputational damage. The high costs associated with failing to meet regulatory requirements, combined with the risk of fallout from security breaches, has elevated this topic from the IT organization to the executive and board level.\nOur business is highly competitive and any failure to adapt to changing consumer preferences may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven, and rapidly changing environment. Our success will, to a large extent, be dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt, upgrade, and exploit new and existing technologies to address consumers\u2019 changing demands and distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new products and services. If we choose technologies or equipment that are less effective, cost-efficient, or attractive to our customers than those chosen by our competitors, or if we offer products or services that fail to appeal to consumers, are not available at competitive prices, or that do not function as expected, our competitive position could deteriorate, and our business and financial results could suffer.\nThe ability of our competitors to introduce new technologies, products, and services more quickly than we do may adversely affect our competitive position. Furthermore, advances in technology, decreases in the cost of existing technologies, or changes in competitors\u2019 product and service offerings may require us in the future to increase research and development expenditures or to offer products and services at no or a reduced additional charge or at a lower price. In addition, the uncertainty of our ability, and the costs, to obtain intellectual property rights from third parties could impact our ability to respond to technological advances in a timely and effective manner. If we are unable to compete with existing companies successfully and new entrants to the markets in which we compete in, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe expect that the success of our business will be highly correlated to general economic conditions.\nWe expect that demand for our products and services will be highly correlated with general economic conditions, as we expect a substantial portion of our revenue will be derived from discretionary spending by individuals, which typically falls during times of economic instability. Declines in economic conditions in the United States or in other countries in which we may operate may adversely impact our financial results. Because such declines in demand are difficult to predict, we or our industry may have increased excess capacity as a result. An increase in excess capacity may result in declines in prices for our products and services. Our ability to grow or maintain our business may be adversely affected by sustained economic weakness and uncertainty, including the effect of wavering consumer confidence, high unemployment, and other factors. The inability to grow or maintain our business would adversely affect our business, financial conditions, and results of operations, and thereby an investment in our Common Stock.\nWe do not currently have any patents to protect our technologies and thus, we may not gain market share from our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our rights to the technologies used in our products and services. We recently filed a patent application with the PTO with respect to our interactive video technology. Currently, we do not have any issued patents and we rely on copyright, trade secrets, and nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology and intellectual property rights. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or maintain any competitive advantage. In addition, we cannot be assured that our pending patent application, or any future patent applications, will result in the issuance of a patent to us in a timely manner, or at all, or that we will have the financial or operational resources successfully to prosecute any patents that we may undertake. The PTO may deny or require significant narrowing of claims in our currently pending or any future patent applications, and patents issued as a result thereof, if any, may not provide us with significant commercial protection or be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. We could also incur substantial costs in proceedings before the PTO. Our pending patent application, and any future patent applications, may be challenged, which could reduce our ability to stop competitors from marketing related technologies. There can also be no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around any patents that may be issued to us in the future. In addition, we rely on unpatented proprietary technology. We cannot assure you that we can meaningfully protect all our rights in our unpatented proprietary technology or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary products or processes or otherwise gain access to our unpatented proprietary technology.\nWe seek to protect our know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology with confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, our partners, independent distributors, and consultants. However, such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements or in the event that our competitors discover or independently develop similar or identical designs or other proprietary information. We currently do not utilize any registered or common law trademarks to protect or brand the name of any of our products.\nAlthough we believe that we have a proprietary platform for our technologies and products, we cannot determine with certainty whether any existing third-party patents or the issuance of any third-party patents would require us to alter our technology, obtain licenses, or cease certain activities. We may become subject to claims by third parties that our technology infringes their intellectual property rights.\nWe do not own any patents relating to our Tagg interactive video CRM platform.\nWe do not currently own any domestic or foreign patents relating to our Tagg interactive video CRM applications platform; however, we recently filed a patent application with the PTO with respect to our interactive video technology. We also do not currently have any licenses to use any third-party intellectual property. As such, if we are not successful in obtaining intellectual property rights covering our products or obtaining licenses to use a third-party\u2019s intellectual property on reasonable and acceptable terms, it could result in lawsuits against us for trademark and/or intellectual property infringement, and we may not be able to counterclaim with our own infringement allegations. Any such infringement, litigation, or adverse proceeding could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could seriously harm our business operations or results of operations. There can also be no assurance that competitors will not be able to duplicate our interactive video technology or that our competitors will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary products or processes or otherwise gain access to our unpatented proprietary technology.\nIf we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, we may be unable to compete effectively.\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our success and our competitive position, and we rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Although we have devoted substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our intellectual property rights, the actions taken by us may be inadequate to prevent imitation or improper use of our products and services by others or to prevent others from claiming violations of their intellectual property rights by us. We also rely on confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions with our employees, consultants, and corporate partners to protect our proprietary rights, but we cannot assure the compliance by such parties with their confidentiality obligations, which could be very time consuming and expensive to enforce.\nLegal challenges to our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our financial results and operations.\nWe rely on licenses and other agreements in respect of our intellectual property with our partners and other parties and other intellectual property rights to conduct our operations. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on the capacity, reliability, and security of our information technology hardware and software infrastructure, as well as our ability to adapt and expand our infrastructure.\nThe capacity, reliability, and security of our information technology hardware and software infrastructure are important to the operation of our current business, which would suffer in the event of system failures. Likewise, our ability to expand and update our information technology infrastructure in response to our growth and changing needs is important to the continued implementation of our new service offering initiatives. Our inability to expand or upgrade our technology infrastructure could have adverse consequences, including the delayed provision of services or implementation of new service offerings, and the diversion of development resources. We rely on third parties for various aspects of our hardware and software infrastructure. Third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control. Interruption and/or failure of any of these systems could disrupt our operations and damage our reputation, thus adversely impacting our ability to provide our products and services, retain our current users, and attract new users. In addition, our information technology hardware and software infrastructure may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other events that could have a security impact. If one or more of such events occur, our customer and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our information technology hardware and software infrastructure, or otherwise, could be compromised, which could result in significant losses or reputational damage. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses, any of which could substantially harm our business and our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on third parties to, among other things, maintain our servers, provide the bandwidth necessary to transmit content, and utilize the content derived therefrom for the potential generation of revenues.\nWe depend on third-party service providers, suppliers, and licensors to supply some of the services, hardware, software, and operational support necessary to provide some of our products and services. Some of these third parties do not have a long operating history or may not be able to continue to supply the equipment and services we desire in the future. If demand exceeds these vendors\u2019 capacity, or if these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or services we need in a timely manner, at our specifications and at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some products and services might be materially adversely affected, or the need to procure or develop alternative sources of the affected materials or services might delay our ability to serve our users. These events could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract users, and have a material negative impact on our operations, business, financial results, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to find suitable software developers at an acceptable cost.\nWe currently rely on certain key suppliers and vendors in the coding and maintenance of our software. We will continue to require such expertise in the future. Due to the current demand for skilled software developers, we run the risk of not being able to find or retain suitable and qualified personnel at an acceptable price, or at all. Without these developers, we may not be able to further develop and maintain our software, which is the most important aspect of our business development\nOur business may be affected by changing consumer preferences or by failure of the public to accept any new product offerings we may pursue.\nThe production and distribution of entertainment content is an inherently risky business because the revenue that may be derived depends primarily on the content\u2019s acceptance by the public, which is difficult to predict. Consumer and audience tastes change frequently, and it is a challenge to anticipate what offerings will be successful at a certain point in time. In addition, competing entertainment content, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions, piracy, and increasing digital and on-demand distribution offerings may also affect the audience for our content. Our expenses may increase as we invest in new programming ideas, and there is no guarantee that the new programming will be successful or generate sufficient revenue to recoup the expenditures.\nOur future success depends on our key executive officers and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel.\nOur future success largely depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and management team, especially our Chief Executive Officer and President, Mr. Rory J. Cutaia. If one or more of our executive officers are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them readily, if at all. Additionally, we may incur additional expenses to recruit and retain new executive officers. If any of our executive officers joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose some or all of our customers. Finally, we do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on any of our executive officers. Because of these factors, the loss of the services of any of these key persons could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and thereby an investment in our stock.\nOur continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel will also be critical to our success because we will need to hire and retain additional personnel as our business grows. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified personnel. We face significant competition for skilled personnel in our industries. This competition may make it more difficult and expensive to attract, hire, and retain qualified managers and employees. Because of these factors, we may not be able to effectively manage or grow our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition or business. As a result, the value of your investment could be significantly reduced or completely lost.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Securities\nOur board of directors is authorized to issue additional shares of our Common Stock that would dilute existing stockholders.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of which 12,213,670 shares of Common Stock and no shares of preferred stock are currently issued and outstanding as of February 1, 2019. The number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of February 1, 2019 excludes 2,315,640 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of stock options, 168,600 shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Plan, 778,443 shares of Common Stock potentially issuable upon the exercise of all outstanding warrants, and 516,078 shares of Common Stock potentially issuable upon the conversion of all outstanding convertible notes. We expect to seek additional financing in order to provide working capital to our business. Our board of directors has the power to issue any or all of such authorized but unissued shares of our Common Stock at any price and, in respect of the preferred stock, at any price and with any attributes, our board of directors considers sufficient, without stockholder approval. The issuance of additional shares of Common Stock in the future will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of current stockholders and may negatively impact the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe may issue additional securities with rights superior to those of our Common Stock, which could materially limit the ownership rights of our stockholders.\nWe may offer additional debt or equity securities in private and/or public offerings in order to raise working capital or to refinance our debt. Our board of directors has the right to determine the terms and rights of any debt securities and preferred stock without obtaining the approval of our stockholders. It is possible that any debt securities or preferred stock that we sell would have terms and rights superior to those of our Common Stock and may be convertible into shares of our Common Stock. Any sale of securities could adversely affect the interests or voting rights of the holders of our Common Stock, result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders, or adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nTrading on the OTC Markets Group Inc.\u2019s OTCQB\u00ae tier Venture Market (the \u201cOTCQB\u201d) may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQB. Trading in stock quoted on over-the-counter markets is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our Common Stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTCQB is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on this market is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a national securities exchange like, NASDAQ or the NYSE. Accordingly, stockholders may have difficulty reselling any of our shares.\nWe have applied for listing of our Common Stock on NASDAQ. We can provide no assurance that our Common Stock will qualify to be listed, and, if listed, that our Common Stock will thereafter always meet NASDAQ continued listing standards.\nOur Common Stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB. We anticipate that our Common Stock will be eligible to be listed on NASDAQ in the near future; however, we can provide no assurance that our application will be approved, and that an active trading market on NASDAQ for our Common Stock will develop and continue. If our Common Stock remains quoted on or reverts to an over-the-counter system rather than being listed on a national securities exchange, you may find it more difficult to dispose of shares of our Common Stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our Common Stock.\nIf NASDAQ approves our application to list our Common Stock and we are not able to comply with the applicable continued listing standards of NASDAQ, NASDAQ could delist our Common Stock.\nRecently, we have applied to list our Common Stock on NASDAQ. There is no assurance that our Common Stock will ever be listed on NASDAQ. Should our Common Stock be listed on NASDAQ, in order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing standards, including those regarding director independence and independent committee requirements, minimum stockholders\u2019 equity, minimum share price, and certain corporate governance requirements. There can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with such applicable continued listing standards.\nThe market price of our Common Stock has been, and may continue to be, subject to substantial volatility.\nThe market price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including;\n\u25cf volatility in the trading markets generally and in our particular market segment;\n\u25cf limited trading of our Common Stock;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u25cf the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet those projections;\n\u25cf announcements regarding our business or the business of our customers or competitors;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or our offerings, or third-party proprietary rights;\n\u25cf announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u25cf any major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u25cf sales of shares of our Common Stock by us or by our stockholders;\n\u25cf lawsuits threatened or filed against us; and\n\u25cf other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events.\nStatements of, or changes in, opinions, ratings, or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the markets in which we operate or expect to operate could have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock. In addition, the stock market as a whole, as well as our particular market segment, has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may affect the market price for the securities of many companies, and which often have appeared unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. Any of these factors could negatively affect our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares of Common Stock at the time and price they desire.\nA decline in the price of our Common Stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital, which could adversely impact our ability to continue operations.\nA prolonged decline in the price of our Common Stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our Common Stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. We may attempt to acquire a significant portion of the funds we need in order to conduct our planned operations through the sale of equity securities; thus, a decline in the price of our Common Stock could be detrimental to our liquidity and our operations because the decline may adversely affect investors\u2019 desire to invest in our securities. If we are unable to raise the funds we require for all of our planned operations, we may be forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations, including our ability to develop new products or services and continue our current operations. As a result, our business may suffer, and we may be forced to reduce or discontinue operations. We also might not be able to meet our financial obligations if we cannot raise enough funds through the sale of our Common Stock and we may be forced to reduce or discontinue operations.\nBecause we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our shares of Common Stock in the near future, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless and until they sell them.\nWe intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock in the near future. The declaration, payment, and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and, if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. Unless our board of directors determines to pay dividends, our stockholders will be required to look to appreciation of our Common Stock to realize a gain on their investment. There can be no assurance that this appreciation will occur.\nIf we are unable to establish appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures, it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, result in the restatement of our financial statements, harm our operating results, subject us to regulatory scrutiny and sanction, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the market price for shares of our Common Stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. We maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, which is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d).\nAs a public company, we have significant requirements for enhanced financial reporting and internal controls. We are required to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. The process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and economic and regulatory environments, and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company.\nWe cannot assure you that we will, in the future, identify areas requiring improvement in our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot assure you that the measures we will take to remediate any areas in need of improvement will be successful or that we will implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future as we continue our growth. If we are unable to establish appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures, it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, result in the restatement of our financial statements, harm our operating results, subject us to regulatory scrutiny and sanction, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the market price for shares of our Common Stock.\nWe lack sufficient internal controls over financial reporting and implementing acceptable internal controls will be difficult with a limited number of directors and management personnel, which will make it difficult to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed and submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported as and when required.\nAs of the date of this filing, we currently lack certain internal controls over our financial reporting. While we have recently appointed two independent directors to our board of directors, one of whom was appointed to chair our audit committee, and have hired a new Chief Technology Officer, we still have a limited number of directors and management personnel, which may make it difficult to implement such controls at this time. The lack of such controls makes it difficult to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed and submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported as and when required.\nThe reasons we believe that our disclosure controls and procedures are not fully effective are because:\n\u25cf there is a lack of segregation of duties necessary for a good system of internal control due, to insufficient accounting staff due to our size;\n\u25cf the staffing of our accounting department is weak due to the lack of qualifications and training, and the lack of formal review process;\n\u25cf our control environment is weak due to the lack of an effective risk assessment process, the lack of internal audit function, and insufficient documentation and communication of the accounting policies; and\n\u25cf failure in the operating effectiveness over controls related to recording revenue.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and implement the necessary internal controls over financial reporting. The absence of such internal controls may inhibit investors from purchasing our shares and may make it more difficult for us to raise debt or equity financing.\nBecause our directors and executive officers are among our largest stockholders, they can exert significant control over our business and affairs and have actual or potential interests that may depart from those of investors.\nCertain of our executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock. As of the date of this Annual Report, we estimate that our executive officers and directors and their respective affiliates beneficially own approximately 34.4% of our outstanding voting stock, on a fully-diluted basis, as of February 1, 2019. The holdings of our directors and executive officers may increase further in the future upon vesting or other maturation of exercise rights under any of the options or warrants they may hold or in the future be granted, or if they otherwise acquire additional shares of our Common Stock. The interests of such persons may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. As a result, in addition to their board seats and offices, such persons will have significant influence and control over all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, irrespective of how our other stockholders may vote, including the following actions:\n\u25cf\nto elect or defeat the election of our directors;\n\u25cf to amend or prevent amendment to our Articles of Incorporation (\u201cArticles of Incorporation\u201d) or Bylaws (\u201cBylaws\u201d);\n\u25cf to effect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and\n\u25cf to control the outcome of any other matter submitted to our stockholders for a vote.\nThis concentration of ownership by itself may have the effect of impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business consolidation, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our Common Stock, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nOur Common Stock historically has been categorized as \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares of Common Stock due to suitability requirements.\nUntil February 1, 2019, the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split, our Common Stock was categorized as \u201cpenny stock.\u201d The SEC adopted Rule 15g-9, which generally defines \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Historically, the price of our Common Stock has been significantly less than $5.00 per share and we did not qualify for any of the other exceptions; therefore, prior to the Reverse Stock Split, our Common Stock was considered \u201cpenny stock.\u201d This designation imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors\u201d. The term \u201caccredited investor\u201d refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 jointly with his or her spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer buying our securities, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability and/or willingness of broker-dealers to trade our securities, either directly or on behalf of their clients, may discourage potential investor\u2019s from purchasing our securities, or may adversely affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (\u201cFINRA\u201d), has adopted sales practice requirements that historically may have limited a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our Common Stock, which could depress the price of our Common Stock.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that, in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives, and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, the FINRA requirements historically has made it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our Common Stock, which could limit your ability to buy and sell our Common Stock, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares, and thereby depress our price per share of Common Stock.\nThe elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers, and employees under Nevada law and the existence of indemnification rights for our obligations to our directors, officers, and employees may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers, and employees.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions permitting us to eliminate the personal liability of our directors and officers to us and our stockholders for damages for the breach of a fiduciary duty as a director or officer to the extent provided by Nevada law. We may also have contractual indemnification obligations under any future employment agreements with our officers. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in us incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and the resulting costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders.\nAnti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Nevada state law hinder a potential takeover of us.\nNevada has a business combination law that prohibits certain business combinations between Nevada corporations and \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d for three years after an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d first becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d unless the corporation\u2019s board of directors approves the combination in advance. For purposes of Nevada law, an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is any person who is (i) the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation or (ii) an affiliate or associate of the corporation and at any time within the three previous years was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of the corporation. The definition of the term \u201cbusiness combination\u201d is sufficiently broad to cover virtually any kind of transaction that would allow a potential acquirer to use the corporation\u2019s assets to finance the acquisition or otherwise to benefit its own interests rather than the interests of the corporation and its other stockholders.\nThe potential effect of Nevada\u2019s business combination law is to discourage parties interested in taking control of us from doing so if these parties cannot obtain the approval of our board of directors. Both of these provisions could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 18568, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "VERB"}
