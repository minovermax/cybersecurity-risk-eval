RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report and our other reports and filings made with the SEC, in evaluating our business and prospects. If any of the risks discussed in this Annual Report occur, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, in which case the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. Some statements in this Annual Report, including statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a limited history with respect to the implementation of our principal PTT business plans and with the spectrum realignment efforts we are pursuing with the FCC, which makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects and future financial results, and our business activities, strategic approaches and plans may not be successful.\nAlthough we were incorporated in 1997, our business model and strategy changed significantly following our acquisition of 900 MHz spectrum licenses in September 2014. Following this acquisition, we have commenced deploying PTT networks in major metropolitan markets in the United States and pursuing an FCC rulemaking process aimed at realigning our spectrum from narrowband to broadband. As a result, the ability to forecast our future operating results is limited and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including our ability to accurately forecast and estimate our future revenue growth and the expenses of deploying our PTT networks and pursuing our broadband spectrum initiatives. We have encountered, and expect to continue to encounter, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by new businesses in highly competitive and technical markets. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or change in reaction to changes in our markets, in our FCC rulemaking process, in our business plans or opportunities, in PTT or other communications technologies, in economic conditions, or if we do not manage or address these risks and uncertainties successfully, our results of operations could differ materially and adversely from our expectations.\nAs a new and unproven business, any future success will depend, in large part, on our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nbuildout our PTT dispatch-centric networks on a timely and cost-effective basis;\n\u00b7\nexpand and retain a customer base for our DispatchPlus service on a timely and cost-effective basis;\n\u00b7\nattract and incentivize indirect dealers to successfully act as our primary sales representatives for our DispatchPlus service;\n\u00b7\nadd new DispatchPlus customers and increase revenues from existing DispatchPlus customers by adding additional users, devices and services;\n\u00b7\nobtain FCC approval for our Joint Petition for Rulemaking requesting the realignment of a portion of the 900 MHz spectrum from narrowband to broadband;\n\u00b7\nmaintain our existing pdvConnect services business, which requires the continuation of our existing relationships with Tier 1 wireless carrier partners;\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully compete in the PTT market against competitors with significantly greater resources and pricing flexibility;\n\u00b7\ncontinue to add features and functionality to our workforce management and other business communications solutions to meet customer demand; and\n\u00b7\nscale our internal business operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner.\nAny failure to achieve one or more of these objectives could adversely affect our business, our results of operations and our financial condition.\nWe have had net losses each year since our inception, and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses each year since our inception, including net losses of $21,827,967, $14,714,168, and $1,211,821 in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant net losses in the future for a number of reasons, including without limitation the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report related to the deployment of our PTT networks, the commercialization of our DispatchPlus service and the pursuit of our broadband spectrum initiatives. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may result in levels of revenue below our current expectations, or losses or expenses that exceed our current expectations. If our losses or expenses exceed our expectations or our revenue growth assumptions are not met in future periods, we may never achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe rely on the selling efforts of third-party sales representatives, such as Motorola\u2019s dealer network, and if these parties do not perform, our business will be adversely affected.\nWe primarily offer our DispatchPlus services to customers indirectly through third-party sales representatives selected from Motorola\u2019s nationwide dealer network and from other select third-party wireless dealers. To date, sales of our DispatchPlus service have been slower to ramp-up than our initial expectations for a number of reasons, including but not limited to, the performance of our indirect third-party sales representatives, longer initial sales cycle, and coverage gaps in certain markets due to delays in our deployment of planned sites that were not or have not yet been completed. We may not be successful in incentivizing our third-party sales representatives to promote our DispatchPlus services at the levels necessary to grow our business. Moreover, our third-party sales representatives may receive better incentives from our competitors or other service providers. In addition, the efforts and programs we implement, including our sales training, lead generation and marketing and advertising initiatives, may not be successful in increasing sales through our third-party sales representatives. The failure by these parties to meet our sales expectations, or to effectively promote our DispatchPlus services, will adversely affect our business and our results of operations. In addition, if our indirect sales channel fails to perform satisfactorily, we may be required to hire a direct sales force or otherwise increase our spending on initiatives to support our indirect sales channel, which would impose significant additional costs on us and could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on Motorola to design, develop and supply our PTT network equipment and mobile handsets and devices.\nMotorola has developed and designed the digital technology and equipment we are utilizing for our PTT network and the mobile handsets and devices we offer to our DispatchPlus customers. In addition, we have entered into agreements with Motorola in which we have agreed to purchase our existing and future network equipment and the mobile handsets and devices we offer to our customers from Motorola, subject to certain terms and conditions. As a result, our business is substantially dependent on Motorola\u2019s ability and willingness to deliver high-quality network equipment and mobile handsets and devices in the quantities and on the time frames we require for our existing and future business. Our business and operations would be negatively impacted by any failure by Motorola to meet our design, development and supply requirements. Moreover, Motorola is also a significant supplier of wireless communications equipment and devices to our competitors. Motorola may elect to focus a greater amount of their financial and other resources on the development of enhanced features and improved functionality for the wireless networks and equipment used by our competitors or on developing alternative technologies, rather than the network, equipment and technology used by us. In such an event, we might be forced to supply our customers with services, equipment or devices that are either more costly or qualitatively inferior to the services, equipment or technologies offered by our competitors. As a result, our arrangements with Motorola may reduce our operational flexibility and may delay or prevent us from employing new or different technologies that perform better or are available at a lower cost, because of the additional economic costs and other impediments to change generally, as well as those that arise under our agreements with Motorola. In the event that Motorola or another one of our suppliers is unable to deliver the network equipment and the mobile devices and handsets required by our existing and future operations, we may not be able to deploy our existing and future networks and offer services to our customers on a timely basis and with the competitive features, functionality and costs our business requires, any of which would adversely affect our future growth and our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully operate our PTT business.\nOur PTT networks and our DispatchPlus service target a very specific niche of potential customers within the existing market for wireless communications services. The subset of the market we are targeting with our PTT networks and our DispatchPlus service may not prove to be as large or as easy to convert from other competitive service offerings as we initially estimated. For example, we have experienced slower customer growth than we initially anticipated in the seven markets in which we have deployed our PTT networks. Because of this, we have implemented a number of sales, marketing and advertising initiatives and programs to increase sales in these markets and to supplement our indirect sales network. Additionally, we have elected to delay the deployment of our PTT networks in additional markets until we have had time to evaluate these new initiatives and programs and assessed our ability to operate a profitable PTT business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the past experience of our management team will be sufficient to enable us to successfully deploy and operate our DispatchPlus business. Furthermore, our sales, marketing and advertising strategies and initiatives may not increase our revenues or allow us to increase our revenues at a pace that will enable us to pay our operating expenses or service any indebtedness we may incur. As a result, we cannot assure you that we can grow our PTT business at a rate sufficient to achieve and maintain profitability.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe wireless communications industry is highly competitive, and in order for us to build a successful business we will need to convert customers to our DispatchPlus service from the services offered by our competitors.\nThere are currently a number of national wireless communications services providers, including certain Tier 1 carriers, and local two-way SMR radio operators that offer two-way PTT dispatch services. We believe that a significant majority of our targeted DispatchPlus customers will be existing users of the PTT services offered by our competitors and may be difficult to attract away from the services offered by our competitors. We have always expected, and we continue to believe, that to build a successful PTT business we will need to convert customers to our DispatchPlus service from the services offered by our competitors. In order for us to compete effectively, we will need to demonstrate the superiority of our service offerings, and may be required to offer competitive or discounted prices in order to convert our targeted customers from the services they are receiving from our competitors. In addition, our targeted customers operate in different industry verticals, and as a result, we will need to tailor our sales and marketing approach to many different categories of customers. If we are unable to convert customers to our DispatchPlus service from the services they are receiving from our competitors, our ability to grow our DispatchPlus business and our operating results will suffer.\nMany of our competitors are financially stronger and have more resources than we do, which may limit our ability to compete with their service and product offerings and their spectrum initiatives.\nBecause of their resources and, in some cases, ownership by larger companies, many of our competitors are financially stronger and have more resources than we do, which may enable them to offer services and products to our targeted customers at prices that are below the prices at which we can offer comparable services or products. In addition, these competitors may be able to use their greater resources to build networks and offer devices that are more robust, provide higher quality operation or offer enhanced features and functionality than the services and products we can offer to our targeted customers. If we cannot compete effectively based on the price, quality and functionality of our service and product offerings, our revenues and growth may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, national wireless communications service providers that offer cellular phone services that do not incorporate a PTT function, or that incorporate a PTT function that we consider inferior to our own in important areas, often provide customers with free or significantly discounted or subsidized handsets as an enticement to sign up for their particular suite of services, which can include services in addition to those offered by us. In contrast, our customers typically purchase mobile handsets or devices from us or our dealers in order to utilize our DispatchPlus service. The cost of the handsets that we offer our customers, as compared to cellular handsets that do not incorporate a PTT dispatch-centric, multi-function capability similar to that which is provided in our handsets, may make it more difficult or less profitable for us to attract customers. Moreover, the cost of our handsets combined with the offering of free handsets by some wireless communications services providers may require us to adopt subsidy programs that would cause us to absorb part of the cost of offering our handsets to new and existing customers. These increased costs for our targeted customers to acquire handsets for use on our PTT networks and any handset subsidy expenses we may need to absorb to offset a portion of these increased costs may reduce our growth and profitability.\nFurther, with respect to our spectrum initiatives, we compete with the Tier 1 carriers, local SMR operators and other public and private companies that are in the business of acquiring and developing spectrum assets. In addition, our broadband spectrum initiatives may be opposed by incumbents and other third parties with conflicting business interests. Many of the third parties who are not supportive of our broadband initiatives or with whom we compete against for spectrum opportunities may have more resources, and greater political and regulatory influence, than we do, which could prevent, delay or increase the cost of any spectrum initiatives.\nIf other wireless vendors or service providers improve their existing PTT dispatch services or we fail to keep pace with rapid technological changes, we may not be able to attract or retain our targeted customers.\nA number of Tier 1 carriers already offer or plan to offer wireless equipment that is capable of providing PTT services or technologies that compete or could compete with our PTT service and product offerings. In addition, a number of third parties have developed mobile communication and workforce management applications that offer comparable functionality to pdvConnect, our suite of mobile resource management applications included with our DispatchPlus service. Moreover, future technological advancements may occur quickly and may render our services or technology obsolete or enable other wireless technologies to offer services or functionalities that are equal to or better than those available in our PTT offerings. In addition, competition among the differing wireless communications technologies could:\n\u00b7\nfurther segment the industry markets in which our target customers operate, which could reduce the demand for, and competitiveness of, our services and technology; and\n\u00b7\nreduce the resources devoted by third party suppliers, such as Motorola, to developing or improving the technology for our network and PTT offerings.\nIf the services, technologies or applications offered by our competitors are perceived to be or become, or if any such services, technologies or applications introduced in the future are, largely comparable or superior to the PTT services, technologies or applications we offer, we may not be able to attract or retain sufficient numbers of our targeted customers or grow our business.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMoreover, the largest national wireless communications service providers by revenue, including the Tier 1 carriers, do not currently focus on PTT dispatch services as a primary component of their businesses. However, if that were to change, it would likely be difficult for us to compete effectively with such providers. These larger service providers have larger existing customer bases that they will be able to introduce PTT dispatch services to, have more money to spend on research and development that may enable them to create services and products that are qualitatively superior to ours, have the ability to conduct nationwide sales and marketing campaigns and may have the ability to operate successfully on a smaller profit per user margin due to the larger volume of customers they service.\nIf our customers do not renew their services with us, our future growth and operating results will be harmed.\nWe do not require our customers to enter into long-term contracts (unlike most of our local SMR system operator competitors) for our DispatchPlus service. As a result, our business strategy depends on building and maintaining a loyal customer base. Our ability to retain customers depends on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to offer our customers high-quality, robust and cost-effective services, the effectiveness of our customer support, the budgeted amounts that our targeted customers are prepared to devote to obtaining their mobile communications solutions and the service and product offerings of our competitors. In addition, we may lose customers if we do not develop new solutions, features and functionality that meet their evolving needs. Given our limited operating history in our recently launched DispatchPlus business, we are unable to accurately predict our customer renewal rates. If our customers do not renew their services with us, our future growth and operating results will be harmed.\nWe may face pressure to reduce our per user prices for our DispatchPlus service, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur competitors may decrease prices or increase the features and functionality of their service and product offerings at an existing price, which could require us to reduce the per user price for our DisptachPlus service. Competition in pricing and service and product offerings may also adversely impact our customer retention and churn rate. We may encounter market pressures to:\n\u00b7\nmigrate existing customers to lower priced service offering packages;\n\u00b7\nrestructure our service offering packages to offer more value;\n\u00b7\nreduce our service offering prices; or\n\u00b7\nrespond to particular short-term, market specific situations, such as special introductory pricing or particular new product or service offerings, in a particular market.\nTo the extent that we are required to offer more competitive pricing packages, our average monthly revenue per user may decrease, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, any future pricing pressure could make it increasingly difficult for us to remain competitive.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf we do not successfully deploy our PTT networks in our existing and future markets, it may not be possible for us to compete effectively.\nIn June 2015, we commercially launched our PTT service in our first major market located in the greater, Houston, Texas metropolitan area. Subsequently, we have commenced service in six additional major metropolitan market areas, including Dallas, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Chicago, the greater New York area, and Baltimore/Washington. We previously announced that we have slowed our deployment of new markets until we have an opportunity to test and optimize the activities we are implementing to increase customer sales, including additional sales training to our indirect sales representatives, lead generation, and marketing and advertising campaigns. In addition to containing a large number of potential customers, we intend to deploy our PTT networks in select major metropolitan markets that are strategically located throughout the United States to support our brand and our sales and marketing efforts. However, if we are not able to deploy our PTT networks quickly enough, or if we do not achieve satisfactory levels of penetration in our identified targeted customer verticals in our deployed markets, other competing services providers may be able to deploy their services and products and capture significant market share before we are able to enter particular markets or to achieve sufficient scale and penetration rates in particular markets, which could make it impossible for us to enter or to achieve satisfactory operating results in our existing and future markets. If we are unable to enter into or to achieve satisfactory operating results after entering, a market, we believe that our overall ability to compete effectively, and our overall profitability and growth will be negatively affected.\nThe products and services utilized by us and our suppliers may infringe on intellectual property rights owned by others.\nWe purchase network equipment and mobile products from Motorola and other suppliers that incorporate or utilize intellectual property which we do not own. From time to time our suppliers have received, and we and our suppliers may receive in the future, assertions and claims from third parties that the products or software utilized by us or our suppliers and service providers infringe on the patents or other intellectual property rights of these third parties. These claims could require us or an infringing supplier or service provider to discontinue certain activities or to discontinue using or selling the relevant products and services. Even when unsuccessful, these claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend, and divert management resources. If these claims are successful, we could be forced to pay significant damages or stop selling certain products or services or stop using certain trademarks, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by disruptions arising from causes beyond our control.\nMajor equipment failures, catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, including severe weather, terrorist acts or breaches of network or information technology security that affect wireless networks, including transport facilities, communications switches, routers, microwave links, cell sites or other equipment or third party owned local and long-distance networks on which we rely, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may be limited in our ability to grow unless we can timely and cost effectively expand our network capacity and coverage and address increased demands on our business systems and processes as needed.\nOur business model depends on our ability to build and grow our customer base and to increase the usage of our services by our existing and future customers, on a timely and cost effective basis. To successfully increase our customer base and pursue our business plan, we must timely and economically:\n\u00b7\nexpand the capacity and coverage of our network in each market we select for deployment;\n\u00b7\nsecure sufficient transmitter and receiver sites at appropriate locations to meet planned system coverage and capacity targets;\n\u00b7\nobtain adequate quantities of base radios and other system infrastructure equipment;\n\u00b7\nobtain an adequate volume and mix of handsets, other user devices and related accessories to meet customer demand; and\n\u00b7\npotentially obtain additional spectrum in some or all of our markets.\nIf we are unable to achieve increased network capacity, or there are substantial delays in doing so, we could be required to invest additional capital in our infrastructure to satisfy our network capacity needs and otherwise may not be able to successfully increase our number of customers on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, our operating performance and ability to retain our customers may be adversely affected unless we are able to timely and efficiently meet the demands for our services and address any increased demands on our customer service, billing and other back-office functions. If we outsource aspects of our customer care function to third parties, we cannot be sure that this outsourcing will not heighten these risks.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur reputation and business may be harmed and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss, disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our, or our customers\u2019, information or other breaches of our information security.\nWe make extensive use of online services and centralized data processing, including through third-party service providers. The secure maintenance and transmission of customer information is an important element of our operations. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit customer information, including location or personal information, or those of service providers, may be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security, or that of a third-party service provider, or impacted by unauthorized intentional or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees, or those of a third-party service provider. Cyber-attacks, which include the use of malware, computer viruses and other means for disruption or unauthorized access, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber- attacks or other cyber incidents which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology resources and networks may be insufficient to repel a major cyber attack in the future. As a result, our customers\u2019 information may be lost, disclosed, accessed, used, corrupted, destroyed or taken without the customers\u2019 consent.\nIn addition, we and third-party service providers process and maintain our proprietary business information and data related to our business-to-business customers or suppliers. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit this information, or those of service providers, may also be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security or that of a third-party service provider, or impacted by unauthorized intentional or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees or those of a third-party service provider. We also purchase equipment from third parties that could contain software defects, malware, or other means by which third parties could access our network or the information stored or transmitted on our or our suppliers\u2019 networks or equipment. We also may face increased risks of becoming subject to cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents as we expand our business model and activities to include establishing and operating our own dedicated network. As a result, our business information, or subscriber or supplier data, may be lost, disclosed, accessed, used, corrupted, destroyed or taken without consent. Any major compromise of our data or network security, failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of our services or customer information and delays in detecting any such compromise or loss could disrupt our operations, impact our reputation and customers\u2019 willingness to purchase our service and subject us to additional costs and liabilities, including litigation, which could produce material and adverse effects on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our FCC Rulemaking Request, Our Spectrum Initiatives and Our Use of Spectrum\nSpectrum is a limited resource, and we may not be able to obtain sufficient spectrum to support our spectrum initiatives and our planned business operations and future growth.\nSpectrum is a limited resource that is regulated in the United States by the FCC. The 900 MHz spectrum licenses we purchased from Sprint include geographic SMR licenses and site-specific B/ILT licenses. We believe we now own approximately 6 MHz of spectrum on average in the top 20 metropolitan markets in the United States, although we might not achieve 6 MHz of spectrum in each of the top 20 metropolitan markets. We believe this non-contiguous spectrum is more than sufficient to allow us to operate dedicated PTT networks using proven narrowband technologies in major markets throughout the United States. Nevertheless, we will need to acquire additional spectrum to support our broadband and the other spectrum initiatives we elect to pursue, and may need to acquire additional spectrum to support our future business plans and growth or our introduction of new products and technologies. We intend to prioritize our future acquisition of additional FCC licenses for spectrum, including SMR blocks and site specific licenses that we believe will ease the process of realigning a portion of the 900 MHz band from narrowband to broadband if and when the FCC approves our Joint Petition for Rulemaking. We have and intend to continue to acquire additional spectrum through negotiated purchases. We also may elect to acquire additional spectrum in government-sponsored auctions of spectrum. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be successful in acquiring the additional spectrum we may need to support our realignment efforts, our future growth, our spectrum initiatives, our future network rollout plans or our future product and technology introductions on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any failure to obtain the spectrum required for our current and future business plans will adversely impact our revenues and our future growth potential and may adversely impact our ability to realign our 900 MHz spectrum and pursue our broadband spectrum initiatives.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur Joint Petition for Rulemaking may not be successful, or may take more time or be more costly than anticipated.\nIn November 2014, we and the Enterprise Wireless Alliance submitted a Joint Petition for Rulemaking to the FCC to realign a portion of the 900 MHz band from narrowband to broadband. We believe this realignment is consistent with the FCC\u2019s mandate to promote more efficient use of limited spectrum resources generally and its ongoing efforts to make more spectrum available for broadband services specifically, particularly in the spectrum bands below 1 GHz. In response to the Joint Petition for Rulemaking, the FCC issued a public notice requesting comments from interested third parties and asked a number of questions about the proposal. A number of interested third parties, including several incumbent licensees, filed comments with the FCC expressing their views, including both support and opposition, and asking a number of technical questions about our Joint Petition for Rulemaking. In May 2015, we and the Enterprise Wireless Alliance filed proposed rules with the FCC related to our Joint Petition for Rulemaking. Comments on the proposed rules were filed in June 2015 and reply comments in July 2015. The proposed rules outline our recommended procedural and technical operating parameters, including field strength limits, processes related to the administration and sequencing of the proposed realignment of the 900 MHz band and requirements for the broadband operators to provide comparable facilities to incumbent licensees, to pay the cost of their realignment and to utilize an emission mask with advanced filtering capability specifically designed to protect licensees adjacent to the proposed broadband portion of the 900 MHz band.\nWe have now responded to all outstanding requests for information from the FCC, and we currently are awaiting FCC action on our Joint Petition for Rulemaking. The FCC\u2019s action may take a number of forms: ranging from a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, to a Notice of Inquiry, to a dismissal of the Joint Petition without further action. To our knowledge, the FCC has not reached a decision on the Joint Petition. We currently believe that the most likely outcome is that the FCC will adopt a Notice of Inquiry as the next step in the process. We, however, do not know the content or scope of a potential Notice of Inquiry. A Notice of Inquiry is a vehicle for the FCC to gather additional information for the record. If the FCC elects to adopt a Notice of Inquiry, it could request additional information and input on the optimal use of the 900 MHz band generally. A Notice of Inquiry could also request information on the specific issues and proposed solutions raised by us and other commentators in the proceeding. The adoption of a Notice of Inquiry does not mean that the FCC has denied our Joint Petition, or that our Joint Petition will not ultimately result in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. We continue to believe in the merits of our proposal, and that our Joint Petition is consistent with the FCC\u2019s past practices and policies. Nevertheless, obtaining a favorable result from the FCC may take a significant amount of time and resources. Even if the FCC does decide to move to a rulemaking proceeding, the FCC\u2019s decision may be subject to legal objections from other licensees and users of licensed spectrum in the 900 MHz band not held by us. As a result, there is no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in obtaining the necessary approvals required to realign a portion of the 900 MHz spectrum from narrowband to broadband. Further, the FCC may impose a number of requirements or restrictions on our business as a condition of its potential approval of our realignment request, which may include provisions in addition to those procedural and technical parameters and requirements already recommended in our proposed rules. Any such requirements or restrictions may impede or delay our realignment plans, result in our realignment plans being more costly than we currently anticipate or impede our ability to pursue or implement our future broadband initiatives. Moreover, we believe we will be required to make additional spectrum purchases and to reconfigure our non-contiguous spectrum to achieve a contiguous 3x3 MHz position in markets throughout the U.S. Our ability to successfully implement this strategy may take more time and be more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we ultimately may not be able to complete the necessary spectrum acquisitions and reconfiguration.\nOur spectrum initiatives may not be successful, may require us to raise significant additional capital or may require us to materially change our business plans and operations.\nIn connection with our Joint Petition for Rulemaking, we are engaged in a number of initiatives to facilitate our ability to deploy a broadband network in the 900 MHz band and enhance the long-term value of our spectrum assets, including acquiring additional spectrum to support our realignment efforts and the deployment of a future broadband network, attempting to build consensus with incumbents, developing a strategic plan for our future deployment of a broadband network in the 900 MHz band, and evaluating whether existing technologies and equipment can be used to support such a 900 MHz broadband network. In addition to our broadband opportunities in the 900 MHz band, we are pursuing additional spectrum and related wireless service opportunities. The potential opportunities we have been exploring include several surrounding the First Responder Network Authority (\u201cFirstNet\u201d), which involves government plans and a related process to provide a substantial amount of funding for the build-out and operation of a dedicated Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (\u201cNPSBN\u201d) that also may be used, on a non-priority, excess capacity basis, to meet the wireless service needs of a variety of commercial customers. There is no assurance, however, that we will be successful in our pursuit of spectrum opportunities related to FirstNet or any other spectrum opportunities that we identify, in converting our non-contiguous licensed spectrum holdings to contiguous spectrum allocations suitable for broadband uses, or in deploying any broadband mobile wireless communications network. In addition, any spectrum opportunities we pursue may require us to raise significant additional capital or to materially change our business plans and operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nGovernment regulations or actions taken by governmental bodies could adversely affect our business prospects, future growth and results of operations.\nThe licensing, construction, operation and sale of wireless telecommunications systems are regulated by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how the spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, including resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands. If we fail to comply with applicable FCC regulations, we may be subject to sanctions, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal and revocation. There is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed. Failure to comply with FCC requirements applicable to a given license could result in revocation or non-renewal of the license, depending on the nature and severity of the non-compliance.\nFuture changes in regulation or legislation could impose significant additional costs on us either in the form of direct out of pocket costs or additional compliance obligations. We may be subject to FCC regulations that impose obligations on wireless providers, such as federal Universal Service Fund obligations, which require communications providers to contribute to a fund that supports subsidized communications services to underserved areas and users; rules governing billing, subscriber privacy and customer proprietary network information; rules prescribing roaming service obligations; rules that require wireless service providers to configure their networks to facilitate electronic surveillance by law enforcement officials; rules governing spam, telemarketing and truth-in-billing; and rules requiring us to offer equipment and services that are accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, among others. In addition, some state and local jurisdictions have adopted legislation that could affect our costs and operations in those areas, including certain billing practices and consumer-related issues that may not be pre-empted by federal law. Further, the FCC and other federal, state and local governmental authorities could adopt new regulations or take actions, including imposing taxes or fees on our business or that we must pass through to our customers, that could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. For example, some jurisdictions have adopted laws restricting or prohibiting the use of portable communications devices while driving motor vehicles, often including PTT devices. If similar laws are enacted in other jurisdictions, we may experience reduced subscriber usage and demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFurther, the FCC and Congress may make additional spectrum available for communications services, which may result in the introduction of additional competitive entrants to the already crowded wireless communications marketplace in which we compete. For example, the federal government recently created and funded the First Responder Network Authority (\u201cFirstNet\u201d), which the federal government authorized to help accomplish, fund and oversee the deployment of a dedicated Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (\u201cNPSBN\u201d). Such an NPSBN may provide an additional source of competition to the 900 MHz broadband network we intend to deploy if the FCC approves our Joint Petition for Rulemaking. Please see the risk factor \u201cOur Joint Petition for Rulemaking may not be successful, or may take more time or be more costly than anticipated\u201d above regarding the impact government regulations and actions may have on our request to realign a portion of the 900 MHz band from narrowband to broadband.\nOur spectrum is a key asset, and the value of our spectrum may fluctuate significantly based on supply and demand, as well as technical and regulatory changes.\nThe FCC spectrum licenses we hold are a key asset of the Company. The value of our spectrum may fluctuate based on various factors, including, among others: the regulatory status of our Joint Petition for Rulemaking; potential uses of our spectrum based on FCC rules and regulations and available technology; the market availability of spectrum; existing demand for spectrum resources; regulatory changes by the FCC to make additional spectrum available or to promote more flexible uses of existing spectrum; the fluctuation of auction prices of spectrum in neighboring bands or any unsuccessful auctions of such spectrum. Similarly, the price of any additional spectrum we desire to purchase to support our spectrum initiatives or our future business plans and growth will also fluctuate based on similar factors. Any decline in the value of our spectrum or increases in the costs of spectrum we decide to acquire could have an adverse effect on our market value and our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nWe depend on our executive officers and key personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of our executive officers and key personnel. Although we have adopted a severance plan for our executive officers, we do not otherwise have long-term employment agreements with any of our executive officers or key personnel. In addition, there is no guarantee that these individuals will remain employed with us. If any of our executive officers or key personnel were to cease employment with us, our operating results could suffer. Further, the process of attracting and retaining suitable replacements for our executive officers and key personnel whose services we may lose would result in transition costs and would divert the attention of other members of our senior management team from our existing operations. The loss of services from our executive officers or key personnel or a limitation in their availability could materially and adversely impact our business, prospects and results of operations. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets. We have not obtained and do not expect to obtain key man life insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of any of our executive officers or key personnel.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may change our operational policies, spectrum initiatives and business and growth strategies without stockholder consent, which may subject us to different and more significant risks in the future.\nOur executive management team, with oversight from our board of directors, establishes our operational policies, spectrum initiatives and business and growth strategies. Our board of directors and executive management team may make changes to, or approve transactions that deviate from, our current policies, initiatives and strategies without a vote of, or notice to, our stockholders. This could result in us conducting operational matters, making investments or pursuing different initiatives, business or growth strategies than those we are currently pursuing. Under any of these circumstances, we may expose ourselves to different and more significant risks and increase our expenses and financial requirements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately determine our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial results, which would materially and adversely affect our value and our ability to raise any required capital in the future.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. We have discovered and may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement or additional documentation. For example, in April 2015, our management identified an error in our calculation and reporting of the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, and the related net loss per common share (basic and diluted), for the six month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2014, the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2013 and the nine month period ended December 31, 2014, as reported in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). Specifically, in calculating the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, management incorrectly considered the effect of two corporate actions the Company completed in connection with its June 2014 private placement, including: (i) the conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock into common stock and (ii) the exchange of nearly all outstanding warrants to purchase preferred stock for shares of common stock (the \u201cCorporate Actions\u201d), as if such events occurred at the beginning of each of these reporting periods, instead of only considering the effect of these Corporate Actions after their actual effective date in June 2014. As a result, our disclosure of the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the six month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2014, the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2013 and the nine month period ended December 31, 2014 were higher, and our disclosure of the related net loss per common share (basic and diluted) were lower, than they should have been if we correctly gave effect to the Corporate Actions only after their actual effective date in June 2014. Although the corrections had no impact on the Company\u2019s net loss reported in the statements of operations, balance sheets or the statements of cash flows for the above mentioned periods and our audit committee did not determine that our financial statements for such periods should no longer be relied upon as a result of the errors in the presentation of the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, our management identified a significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting. To remediate the significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we implemented additional internal control procedures, including additional training and review procedures, to ensure we appropriately track, calculate and report the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, and related net loss per common share (basic and diluted), in future reporting periods.\nPrior to becoming a public company in February 2015, we had not been subject to public reporting requirements and had not been required to assess our internal controls. In addition, we previously had operated with a limited internal accounting team. In the process of preparing to become a public company, we strengthened our internal accounting team and resources and our internal controls. Nevertheless, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in implementing or maintaining effective internal controls for all financial periods. As we grow our business, our internal controls will become more complex, and we will require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective. The existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency in the future may require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner. In addition, the existence of any material weakness in our internal controls could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect our value and our ability to raise any required capital in the future.\nChanges in accounting rules, assumptions and/or judgments could materially and adversely affect us.\nAccounting rules and interpretations for certain aspects of our operations are highly complex and involve significant assumptions and judgments. Our reported financial statements have been and will continue to be based on our assumptions and judgments, and any changes in these assumptions or judgments could have a material impact on our results of operations and the other information contained in our financial statements. The complexities of these assumptions and judgments could also lead to a delay in the preparation and dissemination of our financial statements, or could subject our financial statements to restatement if our independent auditors, the SEC or we determine such assumptions or judgments must be changed. Furthermore, changes in accounting rules and interpretations could significantly impact our financial statements. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in restating prior period financial statements. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial condition and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe have a concentration of risk related to the accounts receivable from two of our third-party carriers and failure to fully collect outstanding balances from these carriers may adversely affect our results of operations in the near term.\nWe offer pdvConnect as a mobile workforce management application directly through our sales force and indirectly through third-party carriers. As of March 31, 2016, we have accounts receivable balances owed to us by two of our carriers representing approximately 49% and 32%, respectively, of our accounts receivable balances. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the credit risk, historical trends, and other information, as well as for any specific instances we become aware of that may preclude us from reasonably assuring collection on outstanding balances. Determining the allowance for doubtful accounts is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates. A determination that requires a change in our estimates for the accounts receivable from either of these two carriers, or a failure by these carriers to pay a significant portion of outstanding accounts receivable balances, could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition in the near term as we are in the early stages of pursuing our DispatchPlus business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe have a limited trading history and there is no assurance that a robust market in our common stock will develop or be sustained.\nOur common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market in February 2015. Since our common stock began trading, we have had limited daily trading volume and we cannot assure you that a more active or liquid trading market for our common stock will develop, or will be sustained if it does develop either of which could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, our ability to raise capital in the future and the ability of stockholders to sell their shares at the volume, prices and times desired. In addition, our lack of significant operating history relevant to our DispatchPlus business and the early stage of development of our spectrum initiatives makes it difficult to evaluate our business, our future prospects and the valuation of our Company, which limits the liquidity and volume of our common stock, and may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock prices may be volatile which could cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nPrior to the listing of our shares of common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market in February 2015, there was no public market for our common stock. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Our financial performance, spectrum initiatives, tax laws, interest rates and market conditions in general could have a significant impact on the future market price of our common stock.\nSome of the factors that could negatively affect or result in fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include:\n\u00b7\nthe rate of customer adoption of our DispatchPlus service, the rate of our deployment of our PTT networks or actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7\nthe status of our FCC petition for rulemaking, including any actions that may delay the rulemaking process, or any requirements or restrictions the FCC imposes on the future use of our spectrum in any proposed rulemaking;\n\u00b7\nmarket reaction to our spectrum initiatives and any changes in our business plans;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7\nactions by our stockholders;\n\u00b7\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u00b7\ngeneral market, economic and political conditions, including an economic slowdown or dislocation in the global credit markets;\n\u00b7\nour operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting principles, judgments or assumptions; and\n\u00b7\npassage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nConcentration of ownership will limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nBased on our review of publicly available filings as of May 12, 2016, funds affiliated with Cerberus Capital Management beneficially owned approximately 24.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock. In addition, our next five largest stockholders beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 42.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock based on publicly available filings as of May 12, 2016 (including, 12.7% by funds affiliated with Owl Creek; 10.5% by funds affiliated with Pacific Investment Company; 7.8% by funds affiliated with American Financial Group; 6.0% by funds affiliated with QVT Financial LP; and 5.8% by funds affiliated with Credit Suisse). In addition, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately 9.51% of our outstanding capital stock. Although we are not aware of any voting arrangements between these stockholders, they have the ability to determine (if acting together) or significantly influence (if acting as a group of two or more): (i) the outcome of any corporate actions submitted by our Board of Directors for approval by our stockholders and (ii) any proposals or director nominees submitted by a stockholder. Further, they could place significant pressure on our Board of Directors to pursue corporate actions, director candidates and business opportunities or initiatives they identify. For example, these stockholders could effectively block the proposed sale of the company recommended by our Board of Directors. Alternatively, these stockholders could place pressure on our Board of Directors to pursue a sale of the company or its assets. As a result of this concentration of ownership, our other stockholders may have no effective voice in our corporate actions or the operations of our business, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and may remain an emerging growth company for up to five years. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:\n\u00b7\nNot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u00b7\nReduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u00b7\nExemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we continue to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. Nevertheless, at this time, we have elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the development and expansion of our business and pursuit of our strategic initiatives and, therefore, do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions contained in any financing instruments and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant in its discretion. Accordingly, you may need to sell your shares of our common stock to realize a return on your investment, and you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or preferred stock, or of other securities convertible into our common stock or preferred stock, could cause the market value of our common stock to decline and could result in dilution of your shares.\nOur Board of Directors is authorized, without stockholder approval, to permit us to issue additional shares of common stock or to raise capital through the creation and issuance of preferred stock, other debt securities convertible into common stock or preferred stock, options, warrants and other rights, on terms and for consideration as our Board of Directors in its sole discretion may determine. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or of preferred stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly. We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of our common stock, or the availability of our common stock for future sales, on the value of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by Sprint or Motorola or another large stockholder, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn connection with becoming a public company, we filed a registration statement on Form S-8 to register the total number of shares of our common stock that may be issued under our 2004 Stock Plan, 2010 Stock Plan and 2014 Stock Plan, including the equity awards issued to our executive officers and directors. Additionally, in January 2016, we filed a registration statement on Form S-8 to register 714,583 additional shares of common stock made available under the 2014 Stock Plan\u2019s evergreen provisions, which provide for an annual increase on January 1 under the 2014 Stock Plan by an amount equal to the smaller of 5% of the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31 or a lesser amount determined by the Board. These shares of common stock are eligible for sale without restriction.\nAs of May 12, 2016, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned an aggregate of 9.51% of the equity interests in our Company, including restricted stock units and stock options. Subject to vesting and to transfer restrictions set forth in our insider trading policy, our directors and executive officers may immediately sell their shares of common stock into the public market.\nIn addition, we may also issue additional shares of our capital stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our capital stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees or for other business purposes, including future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of capital stock will result in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders and may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock.\nFuture offerings of debt securities or preferred stock, which would rank senior to our common stock upon our bankruptcy or liquidation, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making offerings of debt securities or otherwise incurring debt. Upon bankruptcy or liquidation, holders of our debt securities and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. In addition, we may offer preferred stock that provides holders with a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments or both or that could otherwise limit our ability to pay dividends or make liquidating distributions to the holders of our common stock. Although we have no present plans to do so, our decision to issue debt securities or to issue preferred stock in any future offerings or otherwise incur debt may depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control. As a result, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings, and investors in our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and/or diluting their ownership interest in us.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company with securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), we need to comply with certain laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), related regulations of the SEC, and the requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements will occupy a significant amount of time from our Board of Directors and executive management team, and will significantly increase our costs and expenses going forward.\nWe are subject to Section 404 of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, and the related rules of the SEC, which generally require our management and independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Beginning with this Form 10-K, which is the second annual report that we will be required to file with the SEC, Section 404 requires an annual assessment by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for so long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company or, if prior to such date, we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption, we will be required to include an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (a) the last day of the fiscal year following January 26, 2020, (b) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, (c) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior second fiscal quarter (currently September 30th), or the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCertain anti-takeover defenses and applicable law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. These provisions, among other things:\n\u00b7\nallow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of our Board of Directors;\n\u00b7\nauthorize our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock, the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the board of directors and that, if issued, could operate as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors does not approve;\n\u00b7\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our Board of Directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings; and\n\u00b7\nlimit who may call a stockholders meeting.\nIn addition, we have elected to be subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) by provision of our charter. In general, Section 203 of the DGCL prevents an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (as defined in the DGCL) from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d (as defined in the DGCL) with us for three years following the date that person becomes an interested stockholder unless one or more of the following occurs:\n\u00b7\nBefore that person became an interested stockholder, our Board of Directors approved the transaction in which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder or approved the business combination;\n\u00b7\nUpon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the interested stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) stock held by directors who are also officers of our Company and by employee stock plans that do not provide employees with the right to determine confidentially whether shares held under the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or\n\u00b7\nFollowing the transaction in which that person became an interested stockholder, the business combination is approved by our Board of Directors and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder.\nThe DGCL generally defines \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d as any person who, together with affiliates and associates, is the owner of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or is our affiliate or associate and was the owner of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock at any time within the three-year period immediately before the date of determination. As a result, our election to be subject to Section 203 of the DGCL could limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. In addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and officers provide that:\n\u00b7\nWe will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful.\n\u00b7\nWe may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.\n\u00b7\nWe are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.\n\u00b7\nWe will not be obligated pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person against us or our other indemnitees, except with respect to proceedings authorized by our Board of Directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nThe rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.\n\u00b7\nWe may not retroactively amend our bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.\nAs a result, claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 15226, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "ATEX"}
