RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting the Company and its customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers, and the full extent of the adverse impacts on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects are unknown and could be significant.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has created a global public-health crisis that has resulted in widespread volatility and deterioration in business, economic, and market conditions and household incomes, including in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts where the Company conducts nearly all of its business. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's capital and liquidity, and on its business, results of operations, financial position and prospects generally will depend on a number of evolving factors, including:\nThe duration, extent, and severity of the pandemic and any resurgences. COVID-19 has not yet been contained and could affect significantly more households and businesses. The duration and severity of the pandemic, including recent resurgences and the potential for seasonal or other resurgences after any containment, continue to be impossible to predict. In addition, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved various COVID-19 vaccines, the timing of distribution and availability and efficacy of such vaccines remain uncertain. Following any containment, there is also substantial uncertainty surrounding the pace of economic recovery and the return of business and consumer confidence.\nThe response of governmental and nongovernmental authorities. Many of the actions intended to contain the spread of COVID-19 have been directed toward curtailing household and business activity while simultaneously deploying fiscal and monetary-policy measures to partially mitigate the adverse effects on individual households and businesses. These actions are not always coordinated or consistent across jurisdictions and, in general, have changed rapidly in scope and intensity, contributing to substantial market volatility.\nThe effect on the Company's customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers. COVID-19 and its associated consequences and uncertainties, including increased unemployment rates, are affecting individuals, households, and businesses differently and unevenly. Many, however, have changed their behavior in response to governmental mandates and advisories to sharply restrain commercial and social interactions and discretionary spending. As a result, in the near term, the Company's credit, operational, and other risks have generally increased and, for the foreseeable future, may remain elevated or increase further.\nThe effect on economies and markets. Whether the actions of governmental and nongovernmental authorities will be successful in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19 is unclear. National, regional, and local economies (including the local economies in the markets areas which the Company serves) and markets have suffered disruptions and these disruptions could be long lasting. Governmental actions are meaningfully influencing the interest-rate environment and financial-market activity, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nDuring 2020, the most notable impact arising from the pandemic to the Company's results of operations was a higher provision expense for credit losses. The Company's provision expense was $52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $6.0 million in the comparable year ago period. With the continued spread of COVID-19 in the United States, the Company's forecast of macroeconomic conditions and operating results including expected lifetime credit losses on the Company's loan portfolio, is subject to meaningful uncertainty.\nGovernments have taken unprecedented steps to partially mitigate the adverse effects of their containment measures. For example, on March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") was enacted to inject more than $2 trillion of financial assistance into the U.S. economy, and included the $349 billion PPP loan program administered through the SBA. The FRB has taken decisive and sweeping actions as well. Since March 15, 2020, these have included a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to 25 basis points, a program to purchase an indeterminate amount of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, and numerous facilities to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. On December 27, 2020, the COVID-19 Economic Relief Bill was signed into law, creating a $900 billion COVID-relief and $1.4 trillion government funding package to provide additional financial assistance in the U.S., including an opportunity for certain businesses to seek a second PPP loan if they meet specified financial requirements.\nThe degree to which the Company's actions and those of governments and others will directly or indirectly assist the Company's customers, counterparties, and third-party service providers and advance the Company's business and the economy generally is not yet clear. For example, while the Company's loan-deferral programs may better position customers to resume their regular payments to the Company in the future and enhance the Company's brand and customer loyalty, these programs\nmay negatively impact the Company's revenue and other results of operations at least in the near term, may produce a higher degree of enrollment and other requests for extensions and rewrites than the Company anticipated, and the Company may not be as successful as expected in managing credit risk. In addition, while the FRB\u2019s accommodative monetary policy may benefit the Company to some degree by supporting economic activity among its customers, this policy and sudden shifts in it may inhibit the Company's ability to grow or sustain net interest income and effectively manage interest-rate risk.\nAdditional factors related to the credit quality of certain commercial real estate loans include the duration of moratoriums on evictions for non-payment of rent or other fees. The payment on these loans that are secured by income producing properties are typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate property and may subject the Company to risks from adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy, including decreases in collateral values associated with existing loans and the ability to liquidate the real estate collateral securing commercial real estate loans, or the acceleration in macroeconomic trends such as increased remote work arrangements and online shopping. Such trends could ultimately result in a shrinkage of the commercial real estate market to the extent that there is a reduced need for office and retail space as a result of changed operating preferences, which could materially impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition and possibly the Company\u2019s long-term business strategy because commercial real estate loans are the Company\u2019s largest loan category.\nThe Company is unable to estimate the near-term and ultimate impacts of COVID-19 on the Company's business and operations at this time. The pandemic could cause the Company to experience higher credit losses in its lending portfolio, additional increases in the allowance for credit losses, impairment of goodwill and other financial assets, diminished access to capital markets and other funding sources, further reduced demand for the Company's products and services, and other negative impacts on the Company's financial position, results of operations, and prospects. In addition, while the Company continues to anticipate that its capital and liquidity positions will be sufficient, sustained adverse effects may impair these positions, prevent the Company from satisfying its minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements, and result in downgrades in its credit ratings.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental mandates and advisories also have necessitated changes in the way the Company and its third party service providers continue operations, and the length of time that it may be required to operate under these circumstances, as well as the potential for conditions to worsen or for significant disruptions to occur, remains unpredictable. All of these risks and uncertainties can be expected to persist at least until the pandemic is demonstrably and sustainably contained, authorities cease curbing household and business activity, and consumer and business confidence recover. COVID-19 and the volatile economic conditions stemming from it could also precipitate or contribute to the other risk factors identified in this Report, which in turn could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial position, results of operations, prospects, and its stock price, and may also affect the Company's business in a manner that is not presently known to it or that the Company currently does not consider to present significant risks to its business, financial position, results of operations or prospects.\nAs a participating lender in the SBA PPP, including the second round PPP commencing subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company is subject to additional risks of litigation from its customers or other parties regarding the processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties, which could have a significant adverse impact on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe CARES Act included a $349 billion loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals can apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. On April 16, 2020, the SBA notified lenders that the original $349.0 billion of funding under the PPP was exhausted, and on April 24, 2020, Congress allocated an additional $310.0 billion to the program. The Company participated as a lender in both rounds of the PPP. In 2020, the Company made over 6,100 PPP loans for approximately $810 million, with $791.9 million outstanding at December 31, 2020. Additionally in December 2020, the COVID-19 Economic Relief Bill provided an additional $284.5 billion to the PPP loan program.\nThe Company may be exposed to the risk of litigation, from both clients and non-clients that approached us regarding PPP loans, regarding its process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. If any such litigation is filed against the Company and is not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the Company's reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP-related litigation could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.\nThe Company may have a credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Company, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, or as a result of a civil or criminal enforcement action against borrowers who obtained loans through fraud or other misconduct. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Company, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Company, which could adversely impact the Company's business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.\nThe Company has a high concentration of commercial loan balances and exposures within industries negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and continued weaknesses in these sectors could result in additional credit losses in this portfolio.\nThe Company\u2019s commercial loan portfolio is subject to greater credit risk as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and sustained weaknesses could result in an increased rate of delinquencies in, and increased losses from, this portfolio, which, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Commercial real estate markets have been particularly impacted by the economic disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and the federal banking regulatory agencies have expressed concerns about weaknesses in the current commercial real estate market. In addition, management identified approximately $1.3 billion of loans within highly impacted industries, including Accommodations, Food Services, Retail Trade, Other Services (except Public Administration), and Arts, Entertainment & Recreation. Although management enhanced monitoring of loan portfolios in these industries, management is unable to predict or estimate the full impact of all industries affected by the pandemic, which is dependent on factors outside of the Company\u2019s control, including the extent and duration of the resulting economic disruption that has particularly impacted the commercial industries identified above. For more information about the credit risks posed by the Company\u2019s commercial loan portfolio and management\u2019s pandemic response, see Table 14 in Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nRisks Related to Changes in Interest Rates\nChanges in interest rates and other factors could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The Company\u2019s ability to make a profit, like that of most financial institutions, substantially depends upon its net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. However, certain assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in market interest rates. Further, interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate prior to changes in broader market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind. Additionally, some assets such as adjustable-rate mortgages have features, such as rate caps and floors, which restrict changes in applicable interest rates. The Federal Reserve acted to decrease targeted short-term interest rates to 0% - 0.25% in March 2020, and it is anticipated that interest rates could remain near zero through 2023. Some foreign central banks have moved to a negative interest rate environment, which has exerted downward pressure on the profitability of banks in those regions and this interest rate trend could extend to the United States. Any substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFactors such as inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, global disorder, instability in domestic and foreign financial markets, political uncertainty, and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, may affect interest rates. Changes in market interest rates also affect the level of voluntary prepayments on loans and the receipt of payments on mortgage-backed securities, which can impact the expected timing of receipt of proceeds. Particularly in a decreasing interest rate environment, prepayments may result in proceeds having to be reinvested at a lower rate than the loan or mortgage-backed security being prepaid.\nPotential sovereign debt defaults may severely impact global and domestic economies and may lead to significantly tighter liquidity and impact the availability of credit. Economic growth may slow down and the national or global economy may experience additional downturns, including recessionary periods. Market disruption, including potential disruption resulting from the United Kingdom's decision to exit the European Union known as \"Brexit,\" government and central bank policy actions designed to counteract the effects of recession, changes in investor expectations regarding compensation for market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk and changing economic data could impact both the volatility and magnitude of the directional movements of interest rates. Although the Company pursues an asset/liability management strategy designed to manage its risk arising from changes in interest rates, the Company's strategy may not be fully effective, or may be effective in part, and changes in market interest rates can have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability.\nRisks Related to the Company's Lending Activities\nIf the Company experiences credit losses at a level higher than anticipated in the Company's models, its earnings could materially decrease. The Company\u2019s loan customers may not repay loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of loans may be insufficient to assure repayment or cover losses. If loan customers fail to repay loans according to the terms of the loans, the Company may experience significant credit losses that could have a material adverse effect on its operating results and capital ratios. The Company makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers, the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans, and the enforce ability of its loan documents. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, the Company, in addition to assessing the collectability of its loan portfolio, relies on experience and evaluation of economic conditions. If the assumptions underlying the determination of its allowance for credit losses prove to be incorrect, the current allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio and an adjustment may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in its loan portfolio. A problem with one or more loans could require the Company to significantly increase the level of its allowance for credit losses. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses and may require it to increase its allowance for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease the Company\u2019s net income.\nA significant amount of the Company\u2019s loans are concentrated in the Bank\u2019s geographic footprint and adverse conditions in this geographic footprint could negatively impact its results of operations. Substantially all of the loans the Company originates are secured by properties located in, or are made to businesses that operate in, Massachusetts and, to a lesser extent, Rhode Island. Because of the current concentration of the Company\u2019s loan origination activities in its geographic footprint, in the event of adverse economic conditions impacting the region (including, but not limited to, increased unemployment, downward pressure on the value of residential or commercial real estate, or political or business developments that may affect the ability of property owners and businesses to make payments of principal and interest on the underlying loans in the Bank\u2019s geographic footprint), the Company would likely experience higher rates of loss and delinquency on its loans than if its loan portfolio were more geographically diversified, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and events that negatively impact the real estate market could adversely affect the Company\u2019s asset quality and the profitability of loans secured by real property and increase the number of defaults and the level of losses within the Company\u2019s loan portfolio. The real estate collateral securing the Company's loans provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower. Should real estate values deteriorate during the time the credit is extended, the Company is potentially exposed to greater losses. A downturn in the real estate market in the Company\u2019s primary market areas could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing loans, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability and asset quality. Further, if the Company is required to liquidate collateral securing a loan to satisfy the related debt during a period of reduced real estate values, the Company may experience higher credit losses than expected and its earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity could be adversely affected. Any declines in real estate prices in the Company\u2019s primary markets may also result in increases in delinquencies and losses in its loan portfolios. Unanticipated decreases in real estate prices coupled with a prolonged economic downturn and elevated levels of unemployment could drive credit losses beyond the level provided for in the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses. If this occurs, the Company\u2019s earnings could be adversely affected.\nThe Company's emphasis on originating commercial loans may increase lending risks. At December 31, 2020, 74.8% of the Company's loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans. The Company's commercial loan portfolio includes commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial constructions, and small business banking loans. Commercial and industrial loans may expose the Company to additional risks since their underwriting is typically based on the borrower's ability to make repayments from the cash flow of its business and are secured by non-real estate collateral that may depreciate over time. Commercial real estate loans and small business loans generally expose the Company to greater risk of non-payment and loss than residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the continuity of tenant rental payments. Commercial real estate loans also typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential mortgage loans. Commercial construction loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on owner-occupied residential real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property's value at completion of construction as compared to estimated costs. Changes in economic conditions that are out of the control of the borrower and lender could impact the value of the future cash flow and value of the involved property that serves as loan collateral. Additionally, some commercial borrowers may have more than one outstanding loan with the Company and, as a result, an adverse development with respect to a commercial credit relationship may expose the Company to greater risk of loss\nas compared to an adverse development associated with a consumer loan borrower. At December 31, 2020, nonperforming commercial loans comprised 68.4% of total nonperforming loans.\nThe Company may experience losses and expenses if security interests granted for loans are not enforceable. When the Bank makes loans, it sometimes obtains liens, such as real estate mortgages or other asset pledges, to provide the Bank with a security interest in collateral. If there is a loan default the Bank may seek to foreclose upon collateral and enforce the security interests to obtain repayment and eliminate or mitigate the Company's loss. Drafting errors, recording errors, other defects or imperfections in the security interests granted to the Bank and/or changes in law may render liens granted to the Bank unenforceable. The Company may incur losses or expenses if security interests granted to the Bank are not enforceable.\nRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Policy Matters\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely impacted by changes in law, regulations, and accounting policies. The Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination. See \"Regulation\" in Item 1 Business. Any change in the laws or regulations, including as a result of the change in the U.S. presidential administration, or failure by the Company to comply with applicable law and regulation, or a change in regulators\u2019 supervisory policies or examination procedures, whether by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, other state or federal regulators, the U.S. Congress, or the Massachusetts legislature could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Changes in accounting policies, practices and standards, as may be adopted by the regulatory agencies, as well as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and other accounting standard setters, could also impact the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company is subject to heightened regulatory requirements and expectations, increased supervision and increased costs because the Company\u2019s total assets exceed $10 billion. Because the Company\u2019s total assets exceed $10 billion, the Company and the Bank are subject to heightened requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations. The Company is subject to additional regulatory requirements and expectations, increased supervision and increased costs, including: supervision, examination and enforcement by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with respect to consumer financial protection laws; annual stress testing using assumptions for baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios; a modified methodology for calculating FDIC insurance assessments and potentially higher assessment rates; enhanced supervision as a larger financial institution; and a cap on the interchange fees that may be charged in certain electronic debit and prepaid card transactions under the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act.\nWith respect to deposit-taking activities, banks with more than $10 billion in assets are subject to two primary requirements. The first is a deposit assessment based on a scorecard issued by the FDIC which considers, among other things, the Bank\u2019s CAMELS rating, results of asset-related stress testing and funding-related stress, as well as the use of core deposits, among other things. Depending on performance results under that scorecard, the total base assessment rate is between 1.5 to 40 basis points. Any increase in the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance assessments may result in an increased expense related to the use of deposits as a funding source. The second requirement eliminates the exemption from the requirements of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rules on interchange transaction fees for debit cards. As a result, since July 1, 2020, the Bank has been limited to receiving no more than $0.21 plus 5 basis points of the transaction plus a $0.01 fraud adjustment for an interchange transaction fee for debit card transactions. This reduction in the amount of interchange fees received has reduced the Company's revenues.\nThe Company\u2019s regulators may also consider compliance with heightened regulatory requirements when examining its operations generally or considering any request for regulatory approval made by the Company or Bank, which may delay or otherwise impact needed regulatory approvals.\nThe Company has hired additional personnel and implemented structural initiatives to address heightened regulatory requirements and expectations and in the future may need to hire additional personnel, design and implement additional internal controls and structural initiatives, or otherwise commit significant financial resources to regulatory compliance, any of which could have a significant impact on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe impact of changes to the Internal Revenue Code or federal, state or local taxes may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results or business. The Company is subject to changes in tax law, including as a result of the change in the U.S. presidential administration, which could impact the Company's effective tax rate. Tax law changes may or may not be retroactive to previous periods and could negatively affect the current and future financial performance of the Company. Changes in enacted tax rates are recognized when promulgated and therefore could have a material impact on the Company's results.\nChanges to and replacement of the LIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), a regulator of financial services firms in the United Kingdom, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The FCA and the submitting LIBOR banks have indicated they will support the LIBOR indices through 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate. Subsequently, on November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited announced its plan to extend the date that most U.S. dollar LIBOR values would cease being computed and announced from December 31, 2021 to June 30, 2023. On the same date, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC issued a Joint Statement on LIBOR transition, which instructs banks to cease entering into new contracts that use U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate by no later than December 31, 2021, and if practicable, as far in advance of that deadline as possible, notwithstanding its publication until June 30, 2023 In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve. Other financial services regulators and industry groups are evaluating the possible phase-out of LIBOR and the development of alternate reference rate indices or reference rates. The Company has loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. Although the Company has incorporated LIBOR replacement language in many of its governing documents, the transition to a new rate could impact the Company's Market Risk profile and will require changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of the possible replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, but is not able to predict whether the alternative rates the Federal Reserve proposes to publish will become market benchmarks in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a transition will have on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nClaims and litigation could result in losses and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. From time to time as part of the Company\u2019s normal course of business, customers, bankruptcy trustees, former customers, contractual counterparties, third parties and former employees make claims and take legal action against the Company based on its actions or inactions. If such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they may result in financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of the Company and its products and services. This may also impact customer demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. Any financial liability could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Any reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies and other global political factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, may adversely impact the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. There have been changes and discussions with respect to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries, including China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico and retaliatory tariffs by certain of these countries, and there may be further changes as a result of the change in the U.S. presidential administration. Tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that customers import or export, or a trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies have the potential to negatively impact the Company's and/or the Bank's customers' costs, demand for the Bank's customers' products, and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, could adversely impact the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent changes in the global political environment have a negative impact on the Company or on the markets in which the Company operates, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future.\nThe Company may not be able to detect money laundering and other illegal or improper activities fully or on a timely basis, which could expose it to additional liability and could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company is required to comply with anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and other laws and regulations in the United States. These laws and regulations require the Company, among other things, to adopt and enforce \"know-your-customer\" policies and procedures and to report suspicious and large transactions to applicable regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations have become increasingly complex and detailed, require improved systems and sophisticated monitoring and compliance personnel and have become the subject of enhanced government supervision.\nThe policies and procedures the Company has adopted for the purposes detecting and preventing the use of its banking network for money laundering and related activities may not completely eliminate instances in which the Company may be used by customers to engage in money laundering and other illegal or improper activities. To the extent the Company fails to fully comply with applicable laws and regulations, banking agencies have the authority to impose fines and other penalties on the Company. In addition, the Company\u2019s business and reputation could suffer if customers use its banking network for money laundering or illegal or improper purposes.\nRisks Related to the Company's Strategic Activities\nPart of the Company\u2019s business strategy is growth through acquisitions, and the failure to execute effectively on acquisitions could have an impact on its earnings and results of operations. While focusing on organic growth, the Company's strategy also includes, in part, growth through acquisitions. The Company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or complete acquisitions. Further, the success of any acquisition depends on the ability to effectively integrate the acquired business, including integrating operations and achieving synergies and cost efficiencies. Acquisitions can be disruptive as they result in diversion of management's attention from other business activities and can consume significant executive and employee resources as the Company integrates the target's operations and functional business into its operations and business. The Company may experience complications or delays while integrating. In addition, once integrated, acquired businesses may not achieve levels of expected profitability or profitability comparable to those achieved by the Company\u2019s existing operations, or otherwise may not perform as expected. Further acquisitions involve numerous risks, including lower than expected performance or higher than expected costs, potential dilution of stockholder value, changes in relationships with customers, and the potential loss of key employees. In addition, the Company may not be successful in mitigating deposit erosion or loan quality deterioration at acquired institutions. Competition for acquisitions can be highly competitive, and the Company may not be able to acquire other institutions on acceptable terms. The ability to grow may be limited if the Company is unable to successfully make acquisitions in the future.\nThe Company's ability to make opportunistic acquisitions is contingent on regulators granting any requisite approvals. Part of the Company's business strategy includes seeking to make opportunistic whole or partial acquisitions of other banks, branches, financial institutions, or related businesses from time to time. Any possible acquisition may be subject to regulatory approval, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain any such approval in a timely manner or at all.\nRisks Related to Financial and Accounting Matters\nThe Company\u2019s securities portfolio performance in difficult market conditions could have adverse effects on the Company\u2019s results of operations. Under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), the Company measures expected credit losses on its securities portfolios in accordance with the CECL methodology, taking into consideration current market conditions, the extent and nature of changes in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, volatility of earnings, current analysts\u2019 evaluations, the Company\u2019s ability and intent to hold investments until a recovery of amortized cost, as well as other factors. Adverse developments with respect to one or more of these factors could require the Company to recognize an allowance for credit losses, with the credit related portion of the reduction in the value required to be recognized as a charge to the Company\u2019s earnings. Market volatility can make it extremely challenging to accurately value certain securities the Company holds. Subsequent periodic valuations of securities, taking into consideration then prevailing factors, may result in changes to valuations. Significant negative changes to valuations could result in the recognition of an allowance for credit losses within the Company\u2019s securities portfolio, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial conditions.\nImpairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets could require charges to earnings, which could result in a negative impact on the Company's results of operations. Goodwill arises when the Company acquires a business for an amount greater than the net fair value of the assets of the acquired business. The Bank has recognized goodwill as an asset on the balance sheet in connection with several acquisitions. Goodwill is an intangible asset. When an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life, it is not amortized, and instead is evaluated for impairment. The Company conducts goodwill impairment tests annually, or more frequently if necessary. The Company evaluates goodwill using a combined qualitative and quantitative impairment approach. A significant and sustained decline in the Company\u2019s stock price and market capitalization, a significant decline in the Company\u2019s expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or other factors could result in a finding of impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. If the Company were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary, then the Company would record the appropriate charge to earnings, which could have material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\nDeterioration in the performance or financial position of the Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") of Boston might restrict the FHLB of Boston\u2019s ability to meet the funding needs of its members, cause a suspension of its dividend, and cause its stock to be determined to be impaired. Significant components of the Bank\u2019s liquidity needs are met through its access to funding pursuant to its membership in the FHLB of Boston. The FHLB of Boston is a cooperative that provides services to its member banking institutions. The primary reason for joining the FHLB of Boston is to obtain funding. The purchase of stock in the FHLB of Boston is a requirement for a member to gain access to funding. Any deterioration in the FHLB of Boston\u2019s performance or financial condition may affect the Company\u2019s ability to access funding and/or require the\nCompany to deem the required investment in FHLB of Boston stock to be impaired. If the Company is not able to access funding, it may not be able to meet its liquidity needs, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition. Similarly, if the Company deems all or part of its investment in FHLB of Boston stock impaired, such action could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\nReductions in the value of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. A deferred tax asset is created by the tax effect of the differences between an asset\u2019s book value and its tax basis. The Company assesses the deferred tax assets periodically to determine the likelihood of the Company\u2019s ability to realize the benefits. These assessments consider the performance of the associated business and its ability to generate future taxable income. If the information available to the Company at the time of assessment indicates there is a greater than 50% chance that the Company will not realize the deferred tax asset benefit, the Company is required to establish a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset and reduce its future deferred tax assets to the amount the Company believes could be realized. Recording such a valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, the deferred tax assets are determined using effective tax rates expected to apply to the Company's taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Accordingly, a change in statutory tax rates may result in a decrease or increase to the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets. A decrease in the Company's deferred tax assets could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\nSome of the Company's accounting policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the value of the Company's assets and liabilities and results of operations and if actual events differ from the Company's estimates and assumptions, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Certain accounting policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities and results of operations. The Company identified the accounting policies regarding the allowance for credit losses, security valuations and allowance for credit losses, goodwill and other intangible assets, and income taxes to be critical because these policies require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments, estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Under each of these policies, it is possible that materially different values and results of operations would be reported under different conditions, different judgments, or different estimates or assumptions. Further, as new information becomes available, the Company may make a determination to refine or change its judgments, estimates and assumptions, any of which could materially adversely affect the value of the Company's assets and liabilities or its results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the FASB and the SEC change applicable guidance governing the form and content of the Company\u2019s financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret U.S. GAAP, such as the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators, may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Such changes are expected to continue, and may accelerate, dependent upon the FASB and International Accounting Standards Boards commitment to achieving convergence between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Changes in U.S. GAAP and current interpretations are beyond the Company\u2019s control, can be hard to predict and could materially impact how the Company reports its financial results and condition. In certain cases, the Company could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively or apply existing guidance differently (also retroactively), which may result in the Company restating prior period financial statements for material amounts. Additionally, significant changes to U.S. GAAP may require costly technology changes, additional training and personnel, and other expenses that could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nChanges in debt and equity markets or economic downturns could affect the level of assets under management and the demand for other fee-based services. Economic downturns could affect the volume of income earned from and demand for fee-based services. Revenues from the investment management business depend in large part on the level of assets under management and administration. Market volatility that results in customers liquidating investments, as well as lower asset values, can reduce the level of assets under management and administration and decrease the Company's investment management and administration revenues, which could materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations.\nRisks Related to Information Security and Technology\nEvolving information technologies, the need to mitigate against and react to cyber-security risks, and electronic fraud risks require significant resources, and the Company remains subject to cyber-security risks and electronic fraud. The risk of electronic fraudulent activity within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector, due to cyber-attacks (crime committed through or involving the internet, such as phishing, hacking, denial of service attacks, stealing information, unauthorized intrusions into internal systems or the systems of the Company's third party vendors) could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations or damage its reputation. The Company's information technology infrastructure and systems may be vulnerable to cyber-terrorism, computer viruses, system failures and other intentional or unintentional interference, fraud and other unauthorized attempts to access or interfere with the systems.\nThe Company regularly collects, processes, transmits and stores confidential information regarding its customers and employees. In some cases, this confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on the Company\u2019s behalf.\nInformation security risks have increased because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. Many financial institutions and service providers to financial institutions have reported significant breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, denial-of-service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. The Company frequently experiences attempted cyber-security attacks against its systems, and expects such attacks will continue, and may intensify, in the future.\nThe Company expects risk exposure to cyber-attacks will remain elevated or increase in the future due to, among other things, the increasing size and prominence of the Company in the financial services industry, its expansion of Internet and mobile banking tools and products based on customer needs, and its increasing use of operational software hosted on the Internet as more and more software solutions used in the Company\u2019s operations migrate from solutions hosted within the Company\u2019s firewalls to internet-hosted solutions at third party locations.\nTo help manage the Company\u2019s cyber-risks, when entering a new vendor relationship, the Company reviews and assesses the cyber-security risk of third-party service providers. A successful cyber-security attack on one of the Company\u2019s third-party service providers could disrupt operations, adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, or result in the disclosure or misuse of the Company\u2019s confidential information, including customer confidential information. There can be no assurance that the precautions the Company takes to seek to manage cyber risk related to third party service providers will be effective or prevent a cyber-attack that could expose the Company to significant operational costs and damages or reputational harm.\nThe Company\u2019s risk-based technology and systems or the personnel who monitor such technology and systems may not identify and prevent or effectively mitigate successful cyber-attacks when they occur. Significant operational costs and damages or reputational harm may occur if the Company fails to identify and prevent or effectively mitigate, or there is a delay in identifying, a cyber-attack on its systems, or those of its third-party service providers.\nThe Company relies on its systems, employees and certain service providers, and if the Company experiences a system failure or if the Company's security measures are compromised or inadequate, the operations could be disrupted or the customer data could be improperly divulged. The Company faces the risk that the design of its controls and procedures, including those designed to mitigate the risk of fraud by employees or outside third parties, may be inadequate or be circumvented, thereby causing delays or failures in detection of errors or inaccuracies in data and information. The Company regularly reviews and updates the Company's internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Company's controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of the Company\u2019s employees have been working remotely, which arrangements contribute to heightened cybersecurity, information security and operational risks. The Company has not experienced any material impact to the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting due to the fact that most of the Company\u2019s employees responsible for financial reporting are working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the Company is continually monitoring and assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting to minimize any impact on the design and operating effectiveness. The Company may also be subject to disruptions of the systems arising or originating from third party services providers or from events that are wholly or partially beyond the Company's control (including, for example, electrical, internet or telecommunications outages), which may adversely impact the Company's ability to provide service to customers and result in loss, cost and expense or liability. Additionally, the Company's risk exposure to security matters may increase in the future if the Company increases in size and prominence in the financial services industry, as the Company expands internet based and mobile banking tools and products and services, and as a consequence of the risk inherent in system and customer account conversions associated with the integration of acquisition targets. The Company is further exposed to the risk that external service providers may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations on matters of internet security and adequacy of services. (The Company's third party service providers are subject to many, if not all, of the same risks, including internet vulnerability and fraud operational errors by their respective employees.) The Company's due diligence on service providers and other vendor management risk migration activities designed to mitigate service provider risk may not provide full protection against all risks, and the Company's (or service providers) business continuity plans, risk management processes and procedures or security systems (including security against cyber-crime) could be inadequate. While the Company maintains a control framework designed to monitor service provider risks, the failure of a service provider to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements and, if applicable, under\nservice level agreements could be disruptive to the Company's operations, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Liquidity\nThe Company may be unable to adequately manage its liquidity risk, which could affect its ability to meet its obligations as they become due, capitalize on growth opportunities, or pay dividends on its common stock. Liquidity risk refers to managing the Company's liquidity so that it can meet its obligations as the obligations become due, opportunistically capitalize on potential growth opportunities as they arise, or pay dividends on its common stock. The Company's liquidity arises from its ability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding in a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit commitments to borrowers, mortgage and other loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of borrowings, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures. The Company's liquidity is derived primarily from funding obtained from the FHLB of Boston; retail deposit growth and retention; principal and interest payments on loans; principal and interest payments on investment securities the Company issues; sale, maturity and prepayment of investment securities the Company holds; net cash provided from operations; and access to other funding sources. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged changes in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. Factors that could detrimentally impact the Company\u2019s access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which the Company's loans are concentrated or an adverse regulatory action against the Company. The Company\u2019s ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to the Company, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry generally.\nRisks Related to Environmental and Social Matters\nThe Company is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Company may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, the Company may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Company to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit the Company\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Company\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. Environmental reviews conducted prior to originating certain commercial real estate loans, as well as before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, as required by Company policies and procedures, may not detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nSocietal responses to climate change could adversely affect the Company's business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on its customers. Concerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. The Company and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. The Company and its customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions, operating process changes, and the like. Among the impacts to the Company could be a drop in demand for its products and services, particularly in certain sectors. In addition, the Company could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans.\nRisks Related to the Company's Business and Industry Generally\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on maintaining the trust and confidence of customers and other market participants, and the Company's reputation is critical to its business. The Company\u2019s ability to originate and maintain accounts and business is highly dependent upon the perceptions of borrowers and deposit holders and other external perceptions of the Company\u2019s business practices and financial health. The Company\u2019s reputation is vulnerable to threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate. Regulatory inquiries, actual or alleged incidents of employee misconduct and rumors, among other things, can substantially damage the Company\u2019s reputation, even if the inquiries, allegations, or rumors are baseless or satisfactorily addressed. Adverse perceptions regarding the Company\u2019s reputation in the consumer, commercial and funding markets could result in difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts\nand business, as well as in financing accounts and the Company's business. Further, adverse perceptions can result in decreases in the levels of deposits that customers and potential customers choose to maintain with the Company, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nIf the Company\u2019s risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate the Company\u2019s risks, the Company could suffer unexpected losses and the results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The Company\u2019s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. The Company has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor and report the types of risk to which it is subject, including credit risk, operations risk, compliance risk, reputation risk, strategic risk, market risk and liquidity risk. The Company seeks to monitor and control its risk exposure through a framework of policies, procedures and reporting requirements. Management of the Company\u2019s risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models, which, in turn, rely on assumptions and estimates. If the models used to mitigate these risks are inadequate, or the assumption or estimates are inaccurate or otherwise flawed, the Company may fail to adequately protect against risks and may incur losses. In addition, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that the Company has not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated, which could lead to unexpected losses and the Company's results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company has strong competition within its market area which may constrain the Company\u2019s ability to grow and achieve profitability. The Company faces significant competition both in attracting deposits and in the origination of loans. See \"Market Area and Competition\" in Item 1. Business of this Report. Mergers and acquisitions of financial institutions within the Company\u2019s market area may occur, which could add more competitive pressure as the Company would be competing with the resultant larger financial institutions with greater financial resources on a combined basis. Additionally, the Company's market share and income may be adversely affected by its inability to successfully compete against larger and more diverse financial service providers. If the Company is unable to compete effectively, it may lose market share or fail to maintain its market share, and income generated from loans, deposits, and other financial products may decline.\nThe Company continually encounters technological change. The failure to understand and adapt to these changes could negatively impact the Company's business. Financial services industries continually experience rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. An effective use of technology can increase efficiency, enable financial institutions to better serve customers, and reduce costs. However, some new technologies needed to compete effectively result in incremental operating costs and capital investments. The Company's future success depends in part upon its ability to continue to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations. Many of the Company's competitors, because of their larger size and available capital, have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers within the same time frame as its large competitors. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could lead to loss of customers and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business and, in turn, its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of the Company is dependent on the Company's ability to attract, hire and retain certain key personnel. The Company\u2019s business is complex and specialized and performance is largely dependent on the knowledge, talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. The Company relies on key personnel to manage and operate its business, including major revenue producing functions, such as loan and deposit generation. The loss of key personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain and manage these functions effectively, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s net income. In addition, loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s net income. The Company\u2019s continued ability to compete effectively depends on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate its existing key employees.\nAdverse weather, changes in climate, natural disasters, public health crises or man-made events could negatively affect the Company's local economies or disrupt operations, which would have an adverse effect on the Company's business or results of operations. The Company's market area includes coastal regions that are susceptible natural disasters including, but not to limited to, hurricanes, blizzards and northeasters and related flooding and wind damage. The nature and level of such natural disasters, public health crises, such as pandemics or epidemics, or man-made events, including political events such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks, cannot be predicted and may be exacerbated by global climate change. Such events can disrupt operations, result in damage to properties and negatively affect the local economies in the markets where the Company operates. The Company's borrowers may suffer property damage, experience interruption of their businesses or lose their jobs, which may negatively impact the ability of these borrowers to make deposits with the Company or repay their loans or negatively impact values of collateral securing loans, any of which could result in losses and increased provisions for credit\nlosses. Additionally, the occurrence of natural disasters could harm the Company's operations thorough interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of its computer systems which could prevent the gathering of deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling business flow, as well as through the destruction of facilities and operational, financial and management information systems.", "PERMNO": 10252, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "INDB"}
