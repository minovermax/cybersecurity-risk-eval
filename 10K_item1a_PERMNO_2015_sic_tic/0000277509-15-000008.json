{"cik": "277509", "company": "FEDERAL SIGNAL CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe may occasionally make forward-looking statements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of our future performance or statements of our plans and objectives. These forward-looking statements may be contained in, but are not limited to, filings with the SEC, including this Form 10-K, press releases made by us and oral statements made by our officers. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contained in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risks described below.\nOur financial results are subject to U.S. economic uncertainty.\nIn 2014, we generated approximately 65% of our net sales in the U.S. Our ability to be profitable depends heavily on varying conditions in the U.S. governmental and municipal markets, as well as the overall U.S. economy. The industrial markets in which we compete are subject to considerable cyclicality, and move in response to cycles in the overall business environment. Many of our customers are municipal government agencies, and as a result, we are dependent on municipal government spending. Spending by our municipal customers can be affected by local political circumstances, budgetary constraints and other factors. The U.S. government and municipalities depend heavily on tax revenues as a source of spending and accordingly, there is a historical correlation of a one or two-year lag between the condition of the U.S. economy and our sales to the U.S. government and municipalities. Therefore, downturns in the U.S. economy are likely to result in decreases in demand for our products. During previous economic downturns, we experienced decreases in sales and profitability, and we expect our business to remain subject to similar economic fluctuations in the future.\nWe have international operations that are subject to compliance with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, economic and political uncertainties and foreign currency rate fluctuations.\nOur business is subject to fluctuations in demand and changing international economic, legal and political conditions that are beyond our control. In 2014, approximately 35% of our net sales were generated outside the U.S. and we expect a significant portion of our revenues to come from international sales in the foreseeable future. Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks, including the need to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act and their counterparts in other foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, restrictive domestic and international trade regulations, including the imposition of tariffs and trade barriers on our products, changes in these laws, regulations and policies by the U.S. and foreign governments, political and economic instability in the jurisdictions in which we operate, foreign receivables collection risk, local labor market conditions, and, in some cases, international hostilities. The costs of compliance with these various laws, regulations and policies can be significant and penalties for non-compliance could significantly impact our business.\nTo the extent that our international operations are affected by adverse foreign economic or political conditions, we may experience disruptions and losses which could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. To mitigate the risk of foreign receivables collection, we typically obtain letters of credit from international customers to satisfy concerns regarding the collectibility of amounts billed to customers.\nSome of our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies, which exposes us to the risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. Changes in the value of foreign currencies over the long term could increase our U.S. dollar costs for, or reduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants.\nIn March 2013, we entered into a credit facility with a term ending in March 2018. The proceeds from this credit facility were used to refinance the majority of our then-existing indebtedness. The credit facility contains certain restrictive debt covenants and other customary events of default. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants may be affected by the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and other factors outside of our control. Failure to comply with one or more of these restrictive covenants may result in an event of default upon which, if not cured by us or waived by our lenders, our lenders may declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable. Such an acceleration of the maturity of our indebtedness may prevent or limit us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions and taking advantage of attractive business opportunities.\nThe execution of our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued availability of credit and third-party financing arrangements for our customers.\nEconomic downturns result in tighter credit markets, which could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to secure financing or to secure financing at favorable terms or interest rates necessary to proceed or continue with purchases of our products and services. Our customers\u2019 or potential customers\u2019 inability to secure financing for projects could result in the delay, cancellation or downsizing of new purchases or the suspension of purchases already under contract, which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and services and negatively impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.\nOur efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing products and services involve substantial research, development and marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to justify the expense.\nWe place a high priority on developing new products and services, as well as enhancing our existing products and services. As a result of these efforts, we may be required to expend substantial research, development and marketing resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new product or service or enhance an existing product or service are difficult to predict. We may not succeed in developing, introducing or marketing new products or services or product or service enhancements. In addition, we cannot be certain that any new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient revenue to justify the expense and resources devoted to this product diversification effort.\nWe could incur restructuring and impairment charges as we continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure.\nWe continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure. These actions could result in significant charges that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to impairments, employee termination costs and charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits and pension curtailments that could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do. The intensity of this competition, which is expected to continue, can result in price discounting and margin pressures throughout the industry and may adversely affect our ability to increase or maintain prices for our products. In addition, certain of our competitors may have lower overall labor or material costs. In some cases, our contracts with municipal and other governmental customers are awarded and renewed through competitive bidding. We may not be successful in obtaining or renewing these contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.\nWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability, warranty, recall claims, client service interruption or other lawsuits or claims that may be brought against us.\nWe are exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the normal course of business in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. For example, we have been sued by firefighters seeking damages claiming that exposure to our sirens has impaired their hearing and that the sirens are, therefore, defective. In addition, we are subject to other claims and litigation from time to time as further described in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. We could experience material warranty or product liability costs in the future and incur significant costs to defend ourselves against these claims. While we carry insurance and maintain reserves for product liability claims, our insurance coverage may be inadequate if such claims do arise, and any defense costs and liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. A future claim could involve the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which, pursuant to state laws, may not be covered by insurance. In addition, warranty and certain other claims are not typically covered by insurance. Any product liability or warranty issues may adversely impact our reputation as a manufacturer of high quality, safe products and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to keep pace with technological developments may adversely affect our operations.\nWe are engaged in an industry that will be affected by future technological developments. The introduction of products or processes utilizing new technologies could render our existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis new products, applications and processes that keep pace with technological developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. We may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and product or process enhancements. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes. Our products, applications or processes may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes or product or process enhancements, or if our products do not gain market acceptance.\nIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated cyber-attacks pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and operations.\nWe have observed a global increase in information technology security threats and more sophisticated cyber-attacks. Our business could be impacted by such disruptions, which in turn could pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, accessibility and integrity of information stored and transmitted on those systems and networks. We have adopted measures to prevent cyber-attacks and mitigate potential risks to our systems from these information technology-related disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, our systems and networks remain potentially vulnerable to attacks. Depending on their nature and scope, such attacks could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, misuse of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, production stoppages and supply shortages, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.\nInfringement of, or an inability to protect, our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems, physical security and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property and the intellectual property of certain customers and suppliers. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts to protect these intellectual property rights will be sufficient. Intellectual property protection is subject to applicable laws in various jurisdictions where interpretations and protections differ or can be unpredictable and costly to enforce. Further, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain foreign jurisdictions that do not have, or do not enforce, strong intellectual property rights. Any failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.\nThe inability to obtain raw materials, component parts and/or finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner from suppliers would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products.\nWe purchase from suppliers raw materials and component parts to be used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we purchase certain finished goods from suppliers. Changes in our relationships with suppliers, shortages, production delays, regulatory restrictions or work stoppages by the employees of such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely manufacture and market products. In addition, increases in the costs of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or our inability to market products. In addition, our profit margins would decrease if prices of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods increase and we are unable to pass on those increases to our customers.\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur ability to operate our businesses and implement our strategies depends in part on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including finance personnel, research professionals, technical sales professionals and engineers. The loss of the services of any key employee or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects.\nDisruptions within our dealer network could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on a national and global dealer network to market certain of our products and services. A disruption in our dealer network with a significant dealer or within a specific market could have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market. In addition, the loss or termination of a significant dealer, or significant number of dealers, could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters.\nWe are subject to risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters because a portion of our workforce is unionized. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 24% of our U.S. hourly workers were represented by labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Many of these agreements include provisions that limit our ability to realize cost savings. Any strikes, threats of strikes or other organized disruptions in connection with the negotiation of new labor agreements or other negotiations could materially adversely affect our business as well as impair our ability to implement further measures to reduce costs and improve production efficiencies.\nOur pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside of our control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory changes.\nOur funding obligations and pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans\u2019 liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements. Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. In addition, a portion of our pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if financial markets weaken. The level of the funding of our defined benefit pension plan liabilities was approximately 77% as of December 31, 2014. The current year funding status was impacted by lower discount rates and revised mortality assumptions which project longer life expectancy. Our future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate, asset values or the estimated expected return on plan assets. In addition, we could be legally required to make increased cash contributions to the pension plans, and these contributions could be material and negatively affect our cash flow.\nThe costs associated with complying with environmental and safety regulations could lower our margins.\nWe, like other manufacturers, continue to face heavy governmental regulation of our products, especially in the areas of the environment and employee health and safety. Complying with environmental and safety requirements has added and will continue to add to the cost of our products, and could increase the capital required to support our business. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these laws and regulations, we may be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to our operations under existing laws or those that may be adopted. These requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Therefore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions as a result of violation of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and safety regulations.\nOur ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future tax payments could be negatively impacted if there is a change in our ownership or a failure to generate sufficient taxable income.\nPresently, the only U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) we have remaining are from previously acquired companies and hence are limited to specific annual amounts as permitted by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d). If an ownership change, as defined in Section 382, occurs with respect to our capital stock, our ability to use these NOLs could be further limited to more restrictive specific annual amounts. Generally, an ownership change occurs if certain persons or groups increase their aggregate ownership by more than 50% of our total capital stock in a three-year period. If more than a 50% ownership change were to occur, use of our NOLs to reduce payments of federal tax may be deferred to later years within the 20-year carryover period; however, if the carryover period for any loss year expires, the use of the remaining NOLs for the loss year will be prohibited. If we should fail to generate a sufficient level of taxable income prior to the expiration of the applicable NOL carryforward periods, then we will lose the ability to apply the NOLs as offsets to future taxable income. We also have a significant amount of tax credit carryforwards (\u201ctax credits\u201d) which are generally available to offset future U.S. income tax. The usage of these tax credits is subject to similar limitations upon a change in ownership. At December 31, 2014, our tax credits totaled $30.8 million and had carryforward periods generally ranging from 3 to 20 years.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe have a substantial amount of goodwill, which is recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, competition and market and general economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about our sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill recoverability. Goodwill reviews are prepared using estimates of the fair value of reporting units, which incorporate estimates of the present value of future discounted cash flow. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business or market capitalization declines.\nIf the future operating performance of our reporting units is not consistent with our assumptions, we could be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Impairment charges could substantially affect our total consolidated assets and results of operations in the periods such charges are recorded. As of December 31, 2014, total consolidated goodwill was approximately 40% of total consolidated assets.\nWe may be unsuccessful in our future acquisitions, if any, which may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur long-term strategy includes exploring acquisition of companies or businesses to facilitate our growth, enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Such acquisitions may help us expand into adjacent markets, add complementary products and services or allow us to leverage our distribution channels. In connection with this strategy, we could face certain risks and uncertainties in addition to those we face in the day-to-day operations of our business. We also may be unable to identify suitable targets for acquisition or to make acquisitions at favorable prices. If we identify a suitable acquisition candidate, our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. In addition, our acquisition activities could be disrupted by overtures from competitors for the targeted companies, governmental regulation and rapid developments in our industry that decrease the value of a potential target\u2019s products or services.\nAcquisitions involve risks, including those associated with the following:\n\u2022\nintegrating the operations, financial reporting, disparate systems and processes and personnel of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nmanaging geographically dispersed operations;\n\u2022\ndiverting management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nentering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience; and\n\u2022\nlosing key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies.\nWe also may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits associated with our acquisitions. Acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of, among other things, the incurrence of debt, acquisition costs, impairment of goodwill and amortization of other intangible assets. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities.\nBusinesses acquired by us may have liabilities that are not known to us.\nWe may assume liabilities in connection with the acquisition of businesses. There may be liabilities that we fail or are unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the acquired businesses. In these circumstances, we cannot assure that our rights to indemnification from the sellers of the acquired businesses to us will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the businesses or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.", "PERMNO": 47706, "SIC": 3711, "TIC": "FSS"}
