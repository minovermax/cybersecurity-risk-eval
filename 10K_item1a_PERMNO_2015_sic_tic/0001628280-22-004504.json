Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRISKS RELATED TO RENEWABLE FUEL AND LOW CARBON FUEL INCENTIVES\nThe Renewable Fuel Standard Program, a federal law requiring the consumption of qualifying biofuels, could be repealed, curtailed or otherwise changed, which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating margins and financial condition.\nWe and other participants in the bio-based diesel industry rely on governmental programs requiring or incentivizing the consumption of biofuels. Bio-based diesel has historically been more expensive to produce than petroleum-based diesel fuel and these governmental programs support a market for bio-based diesel that might not otherwise exist.\nOne of the most important of these programs is the RFS2, a federal law that requires that transportation fuels in the United States contain a minimum amount of renewable fuel. This program is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"). The EPA's authority includes setting annual minimum aggregate levels of consumption in four renewable fuel categories, including the two primary categories in which our fuel competes bio-based diesel and advanced biofuel. The parties obligated to comply with this RVO are petroleum refiners and petroleum fuel importers.\nThe petroleum industry is strongly opposed to the RFS2 and can be expected to continue to press for changes both in the RFS2 itself and in the way that it is administered by the EPA. One key point of contention is the rate of growth in the annual RVO. The RVO for bio-based diesel was set at steadily rising levels beginning at 1.00 billion gallons in 2012 and increasing to 2.00 billion gallons in 2017. However, growth in the RVO for bio-based diesel was constrained in years 2017 through 2019, as the bio-based diesel RVO increased by only 100,000 gallons from 2.00 billion to 2.10 billion gallons while the advanced biofuel RVO increased from 4.28 billion gallons to 4.92 billion gallons. For 2020 and 2021, the EPA set the bio-based diesel RVO at 2.43 billion gallons. The 2020 advanced biofuel RVO was set at 4.63 billion gallons which represents zero growth in the advanced biofuels category after taking into account the increase in the cellulosic volumes. We believe that growth in the annual RVOs strongly influences our ability to grow our business and supports the price of our fuel through the RINs. The EPA's future decisions regarding the RVO will significantly influence our revenues and profit margins.\nThe RFS2 also grants to the EPA authority to waive a qualifying refiner's obligation to comply with RFS2, through a small refinery exemption (\"SRE\"), based on a determination that the program is causing severe economic harm to that refinery. SREs can significantly harm demand for bio-based diesel and the value of RINs. In December 2019, the EPA issued a ruling on the reallocation of the required volumes under RFS2 in an attempt to offset the effect of the SREs. The ruling detailed the intent to redistribute the exempt volumes granted through the SRE to non-exempt obligated parties. This redistribution will be calculated on a three-year rolling average, based on the U.S. Department of Energy (\"DoE\") recommended relief. The EPA has consistently granted more relief through small refinery waivers than recommended by the DoE.\nThe table below summarizes the small refinery waiver petitions requested, granted, denied or pending and the impacted volumes as of February 17, 2022, according to the EPA's website:\nSubsequent to the EPA's December 2019 ruling, in January 2020, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling invalidating the process the EPA had been using to grant SREs. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned this ruling in June 2021. This ruling invalidated the requirement to have a continuous trend of applications for SREs. The EPA could change their procedures to permit more SREs and that has the potential to cause further harm to RIN values.\nThe EPA released its proposed RVO for 2021 and 2022 with increases in bio-based diesel and advanced categories. The EPA also proposed to retroactively reduce the 2020 RVO as part of the announcement. In addition, EPA sought comments on denying more than 60 pending SRE's between 2016 and 2021. If finalized, these developments will provide more certainty to the industry to know what the requirement of the obligated parties will be in 2022.\nThe U.S. Congress could repeal, curtail or otherwise change the RFS2 program in a manner adverse to us. Similarly, the EPA could curtail or otherwise change its administration of the RFS2 program in a manner adverse to us, including by not increasing or even decreasing the RVO, by waiving compliance with the RVO or otherwise. In addition, while Congress specified RFS2 volume requirements through 2022 (subject to adjustment in the rulemaking process), beginning in 2023 required volumes of renewable fuel will be largely at the discretion of the EPA (in coordination with the Secretary of Energy and Secretary of Agriculture). We cannot predict what changes, if any, will occur, or the impact of any changes on our business, although adverse changes could seriously harm our revenues, earnings and financial condition.\nLoss of or reductions in federal and state government tax incentives for bio-based diesel production or consumption may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating margins.\nFederal and state tax incentives have assisted the bio-based diesel industry by making the price of bio-based diesel more cost competitive with the price of petroleum-based diesel fuel.\nFederal Tax Incentives\nThe most significant tax incentive program has been the federal biodiesel mixture excise tax credit, referred to as the Biodiesel Tax Credit (\"BTC\"). Under the BTC, the first person to blend pure bio-based diesel with petroleum-based diesel fuel receives a $1.00-per-gallon refundable tax credit.\nThe BTC was established on January 1, 2005 and has lapsed and been reinstated retroactively and prospectively several times. Most recently in December 2019, the BTC was retroactively reinstated for 2018 and 2019 and is in effect from January 2020 through December 2022. Unlike the RFS2 program, the BTC has a direct effect on federal government spending and changes in federal budget policy could result in its elimination or in changes to its terms that are less beneficial to us. We cannot predict what action, if any, Congress may take with respect to the BTC after 2022. There is no assurance that the BTC will be reinstated, that it will be reinstated on the same terms or, if reinstated, that its application will be retroactive, prospective or both. Any adverse changes in the BTC can be expected to harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nState Tax Incentives\nSeveral states have enacted tax incentives for the use of biodiesel. For example, Illinois has a generally applicable 6.25% sales tax, but offers an exemption from this tax for a blend of fuel that consists of greater than 10% biodiesel that is set to expire at the end of 2022. In Iowa, for 2018 through 2025, retailers earn $0.035 per gallon for 5%-10% biodiesel blends and $0.055 per gallon for 11% and above blends. Iowa also has a bio-based diesel production incentive that provides $0.02 per gallon of production capped at the first 25 million gallons per production plant. The biodiesel and RD portion of fuel blends are exempt from Texas state excise tax, which results in a $0.20 per gallon incentive. Minnesota law requires a 5% biodiesel blend except during the summer months when a 20% biodiesel blend is required. State budget or other considerations could cause the modification or elimination of tax incentive programs. The curtailment or elimination of such incentives could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales of our renewable fuel in the State of California primarily as a result of California\u2019s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (\"LCFS\"); adverse changes in this law or reductions in the value of LCFS credits would harm our revenues and profits.\nWe estimate that our revenues from the sale of renewable fuel in California and from sales of credits received under LCFS were approximately $593 million in 2021. The LCFS is designed to reduce greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions associated with transportation fuels used in California by ensuring that the total amount of fuel consumed meets declining targets for such emissions. The regulation quantifies lifecycle GHG emissions by assigning a \u201ccarbon intensity\u201d (\"CI\") score to each transportation fuel based on that fuel\u2019s lifecycle assessment. Each petroleum fuel provider, generally the fuel\u2019s producer or importer is required to ensure that the overall CI score for its fuel pool meets the annual carbon intensity target for a given year. This obligation is tracked through credits and deficits and credits can be traded. We receive LCFS credits when we sell qualified fuels in California. As a result of the trading price of LCFS credits, California has become a desirable market in which to sell our bio-based diesel and an increasing percentage of our revenue and profit is related to sales to California and LCFS credit values. In 2021, LCFS credit prices ranged from a high of $201 per credit in January to a low of $142 per credit in November. If the value of LCFS credits were to materially decrease as a result of over-supply or a lack of demand, our revenues and profits would be seriously harmed. Furthermore, if we experienced reduced demand for our fuels or LCFS credits in California, either as a result of oversupply, competitive pressure, lack of market liquidity, or regulatory change, or for other reasons including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenues and profits would be seriously harmed. In addition, if the fuel we produced is deemed not to qualify for LCFS credits, or if the LCFS or the manner in which it is administered or applied were otherwise changed in a manner adverse to us, our revenues and profits would be seriously harmed.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales of our renewable fuel in Canada and Europe; adverse changes in the programs requiring the use of renewable and lower carbon fuels or reductions in the value of credits would harm our revenues and profits.\nWe estimate that our revenues from the sale of renewable fuels in Canada and Europe were approximately $544 million in 2021. Canadian provinces and certain European countries have policies designed to increase the level of renewable content in transportation fuels and/or reduce GHG emissions associated with such fuels. As a result of these policies, these markets have become increasingly important for our bio-based diesel and an increasing percentage of our revenue and profit is related to sales into these markets. If the value of bio-based diesel in these markets were to materially decrease, as a result of reduced demand or increased supply by competitors, or for other reasons including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, if the fuel we produce is deemed not to qualify for compliance in those markets, or those policies are otherwise changed in a manner adverse to us, our revenues and profits could be seriously harmed.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy. While we did not incur significant, unmanageable operational or financial disruptions during the year ended December 31, 2020 or 2021 from the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants as well as those measures to address the pandemic, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly unpredictable.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants on our business, including our planned site improvement and capacity expansion at our Geismar, Louisiana facility, is highly uncertain, as information is evolving with respect to the duration and severity of the pandemic. We cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, or its impact, which may be significantly harmful to our operations and profitability.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our profitability from the production of RD at our plant in Geismar, Louisiana and any interruption in our operations would have a material adverse effect on operations and financial conditions.\nRD carries a premium price compared to biodiesel as a result of a variety of factors including its ability to be blended with petroleum diesel, better cold weather performance, and generation of more RINs on a per gallon basis. We estimate that our RD production in Geismar, Louisiana generated a significant portion of our net income from continuing operations and our non-GAAP adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, (\"EBITDA\") for 2021 and 2020. We experienced two fires at this facility in 2015 that each resulted in the plant being shut down for a lengthy period. If production at this facility were interrupted again due to any reason, such as due to natural disasters, it would have a disproportionately significant and material adverse impact on our operations and financial conditions.\nOur planned capacity expansion at our Geismar, Louisiana facility will require significant capital expenditures and there is no guarantee that the project will be completed on time or on budget, which could have a negative effect on revenues and operations.\nIn October 2020, we announced our plan to expand the effective capacity of our Geismar, Louisiana biorefinery. The Geismar project involves both an improvement project for the existing operations at site with the capacity expansion. The Geismar project is expected to take total annual site production capacity from 90 million to 340 million gallons, enhance existing operations and improve operational reliability and logistics. The improvement and expansion is expected to be mechanically complete in 2023 with full operations in early 2024. We have received all required permits to proceed with construction and officially broke ground to start the construction process in the fourth quarter of 2021. The capital cost for the Geismar project is estimated to be $950 million. We have obtained funding to finance the project with a combination of cash on hand, marketable securities, borrowings under our credit facilities, and proceeds from our public offering of common stock that closed in March 2021 and proceeds from our issuance of Green Notes that closed in May 2021. In addition, in connection with the expansion, we have entered into an agreement for a long-term marine terminal lease for terminal and logistics services that will require a separate capital outlay. There is no guarantee that the project will be completed timely or within budget. If there are cost overruns or construction delays, delays due to natural disaster or other reasons, or if we are not able to obtain the governmental permits and third party easements required or necessary to initiate or complete the project, there could be a negative effect on our revenues and operations.\nIncreased industry-wide production of biodiesel due to potential utilization of existing excess production capacity, announced plant expansions of RD and potential co-processing of RD by petroleum refiners, could reduce prices for our fuel and increase costs of feedstocks, which would seriously harm our revenues and operations.\nIf additional volumes of advanced biofuel RIN production comes online and the EPA does not increase the RVO in accordance with the increased production, the volume of advanced biofuel RINs generated could exceed the volume required under the RFS2. In the event this occurs, bio-based diesel and advanced biofuel RIN prices would be expected to decrease, potentially significantly, harming demand for our products and our profitability.\nSeveral leading bio-based diesel companies have announced their intention to expand production of RD for the U.S. market. World Energy has announced that it will expand capacity at its Los Angeles area biorefinery from 45 mmgy to over 300 mmgy. Diamond Green Diesel, the largest U.S. producer of RD, has expanded its 275 mmgy capacity by 400 mmgy as well as constructing an additional 470 mmgy biorefinery in Texas. Neste, the largest global producer of RD, is expanding its Singapore facility which exports a significant portion of its production to the U.S. West Coast. Traditional petroleum refiners are also entering the RD market with CVR, Holly Frontier, Marathon Petroleum and Philips 66 converting existing refineries to RD production facilities.\nFurther, due to economic incentives available, several petroleum refiners have started or may soon start to produce co-processed RD, or CPRD. CPRD uses the same feedstocks to produce bio-based diesel and it generates an advanced biofuel RIN. CPRD may be more cost-effective to produce than bio-based diesel, particularly biodiesel.\nIf production of competitive advanced biofuels increases significantly as a result of utilization of existing excess production capacity or new capacity as described above, competition for feedstocks would increase significantly, harming margins. Furthermore, if supply of advanced biofuels exceeds demand, prices for RD and for RINs and other credits may decrease significantly, harming profitability and potentially forcing us to idle, reduce capacity, or shut down facilities.\nOur gross margins are dependent on the spread between bio-based diesel prices and feedstock costs, each of which are volatile and can cause our results of operations to fluctuate substantially.\nBio-based diesel has traditionally been marketed primarily as an additive or alternative to petroleum-based diesel fuel, and, as a result, bio-based diesel prices have been heavily influenced by the price of petroleum-based diesel fuel, adjusted for government incentives supporting renewable fuels, more so than bio-based diesel production costs. The absence of a close correlation between production costs and bio-based diesel prices means that we may be unable to pass increased production costs on to our customers in the form of higher prices. If there is a decrease in the spread between bio-based diesel prices and feedstock costs, whether as a result of an increase in feedstock prices, availability of feedstocks, or as a result of a reduction in bio-based diesel and credit prices, gross margins, cash flow and operations would be adversely affected.\nEnergy prices, particularly the market price for crude oil, are volatile. The NYMEX ULSD prices increased throughout 2021 as a result of slow economic recover from the pandemic and continued increases in commodity prices, ranging from a high of $2.59 per gallon to a low of $1.46 per gallon.\nIn addition, an element of the price of bio-based diesel that we produce is the value of the associated credits, including RINs. RIN prices in the bio-based diesel category, as reported by the OPIS, have been sharply trending higher in 2021, ranging\nfrom $0.94 to $2.05 per RIN, while in 2020, RIN prices were highly volatile ranging from $0.37 to $1.03 per RIN. For the past several years, there has been significant volatility in RIN prices. Reductions in RIN values, such as those experienced in prior years, may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits as they directly reduce the value that we are able to capture for our bio-based diesel.\nA decrease in the availability or an increase in the price of feedstocks may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. The price and availability of feedstocks and other raw materials may be influenced by general economic, market, environmental, and regulatory factors. During periods when the BTC has lapsed, bio-based diesel producers may elect to continue purchasing feedstock and producing bio-based diesel at negative margins under the assumption the BTC will be retroactively reinstated, and consequently, the price of feedstocks may not decrease to a level proportionate to current operating margins. Increasing production of bio-based diesel puts pressure on feedstock supply and availability to the bio-based diesel industry. The bio-based diesel industry may have difficulty in procuring feedstocks at economical prices if competition for bio-based diesel feedstocks increases due to newly added capacity.\nHistorically, the spread between bio-based diesel prices and feedstock costs has varied significantly. Although actual yields vary depending on the feedstock quality, the average monthly spread between the price per gallon of B100 as reported by OPIS, and the price per gallon for the amount of choice white grease necessary to produce one gallon of B100 was $0.97 in 2019, $1.12 in 2020 and $1.34 in 2021, assuming eight pounds of choice white grease yields one gallon of bio-based diesel. The average monthly spread for the amount of crude soybean oil required to produce one gallon of B100, based on the nearby futures contract as reported on the Chicago Board of Trade, was $0.59 in 2019, $0.70 in 2020 and $0.89 in 2021, assuming 7.5 pounds of soybean oil yields one gallon of bio-based diesel. For 2019, 2020 and 2021, approximately 71%, 65% and 78%, respectively, of our annual total feedstock usage was distillers corn oil, used cooking oil or inedible animal fat, and approximately 29%, 35% and 22%, respectively, was virgin vegetable oils. When the spread between bio-based diesel prices and feedstock prices narrows, our profitability will be harmed.\nRisk management transactions could significantly increase our operating costs and may not be effective.\nIn an attempt to partially offset the effects of volatile feedstock costs and bio-based diesel fuel prices, we enter into contracts that establish market positions in feedstocks, such as distillers corn oil, used cooking oil, inedible animal fats and soybean oil, along with related commodities, such as heating oil and ULSD. The financial impact of such market positions depends on commodity prices at the time that we are required to perform our obligations under these contracts as well as the cumulative sum of the obligations we assume under these contracts.\nRisk management activities can themselves result in losses when a position is purchased in a declining market or a position is sold in a rising market. Risk management arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss where the counterparty defaults on its contract or, in the case of exchange-traded or over-the-counter futures or options contracts, where there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the contract and the actual prices paid or received by us. Changes in the value of these futures instruments are recognized in current income and may result in margin calls. We had risk management gains of $2.4 million from our derivative financial instrument trading activity for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to risk management gains of $36.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, the net notional volumes of NY Harbor ULSD, CBOT Soybean Oil and NYMEX Natural Gas covered under our open risk management contracts were approximately 62.7 million gallons, 133.7 million pounds and 3.2 million million British thermal units, respectively. A 10% positive change in the prices of NYMEX NY Harbor ULSD would have a negative effect of $14.6 million on the fair value of these instruments at December 31, 2021. A 10% positive change in the price of CBOT Soybean Oil would have had a positive effect of $7.6 million on the fair value of these instruments at December 31, 2021. A 10% positive change in the price of NYMEX Natural gas would not have a material impact on the fair value of these instruments. If these adverse changes in derivative instrument fair value were to occur in larger magnitude or simultaneously, a significant amount of liquidity would be needed to fund margin calls. In addition, we may also vary the amount of risk management strategies we undertake, or we may choose not to engage in risk management transactions at all. Our results of operation may be negatively impacted if we are not able to manage our risk management strategy effectively.\nOne customer accounted for a meaningful percentage of revenues and a loss of this customer could have an adverse impact on our total revenues.\nOne customer, Pilot Travel Centers LLC (\"Pilot\"), the largest operator of travel centers in North America, accounted for 15%, 19% and 17% of our total biodiesel gallons sold in each of 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In the event we lose Pilot as a customer or Pilot significantly reduces the volume of bio-based diesel purchased from us, it could be difficult to replace the lost revenues, and our profitability and cash flow could be materially harmed. We do not have a long-term contract with Pilot that ensures a continuing level of business from Pilot.\nOur facilities and our business, and our customers' facilities, are subject to risks associated with fire, explosions, leaks, natural disasters, including climate change, and political turmoil, which may disrupt our business and increase costs and liabilities.\nBecause bio-based diesel and some of its inputs and outputs are combustible and/or flammable, a leak, fire or explosion may occur at a plant or customer\u2019s, supplier's or vendor's facility which could result in damage to the plant and nearby properties, injury or death to employees and others, cause environmental contamination, and interruption of operations. For example, we experienced fires at our Geismar facility in April 2015 and again in September 2015 and there was a fire at our Madison facility in June 2017. As a result of these fires, people were injured, and the affected facilities were shut down for lengthy periods while repairs and upgrades were completed.\nThe operations at our facilities are also subject to the risk of natural disasters. Our Geismar facility, due to its Gulf Coast location, is vulnerable to hurricanes, tropical storms and flooding, which may cause plant damage, injury or death to employees and others and interruption of operations. For example, in August 2021, Hurricane Ida hit Louisiana causing reduced operating days at our Geismar facility as a result of the damaging winds and flooding that created necessary safety checks for our employees and the facility before it was deemed safe to restart operations. As another example, in August 2016 we experienced reduced operating days at our Geismar facility as a result of local area flooding and reduced operating days at our former Houston facility as a result of Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. A majority of our facilities are located in the Midwest and are subject to tornadic activity. In addition, California has become one of our largest markets, serviced by our Geismar and Midwest facilities. An earthquake, fires, or other natural disaster could disrupt our ability to transport, store and deliver products to California. Changing weather patterns and climatic conditions, such as global warming, have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters and have created additional uncertainty. The Company's operations could be exposed to a number of physical risks from climate change, such as changes in rainfall rates, rising sea levels, reduced water availability, higher temperatures, fire and other extreme weather events. We are not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential losses or costs associated with the physical effects of climate change.\nIf we experience a fire or other serious incident at our facilities or if any of our facilities is affected by a natural disaster, we may incur significant additional costs, including, loss of profits due to unplanned temporary or permanent shutdowns of our facilities, loss of the ability to transport products or increased costs to do so, cleanup costs, liability for damages or injuries, legal and reconstruction expenses. The incurrence of significant additional costs would harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are reliant on a number of consumables and other components as well as services that are provided by third party suppliers that are critical to our manufacturing processes and overall supply chain. The loss of one of these suppliers may have a significant impact on our business and result in production delays while we seek alternative sources for supply. For\nexample, our European operations rely on the availability of a particular catalyst. In 2021, the supplier of the catalyst experienced a large explosion at its facility resulting in the interruption of supply of the catalyst. The resulting disruption resulted in the suspension of operations at our facilities in Germany for a period of time while replacement solutions and other suppliers were located.\nPolitical and economic instability (such as the recent events in Ukraine), as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the countries in which we or our suppliers are located, the availability of feedstocks, disruption or delay in the transportation of our products, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition, the U.S. foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting us or our suppliers could adversely affect our financial performance.\nCyberattacks targeting our process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThere are numerous and evolving risks to our cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to us, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access our information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom we conduct business. Although we devote resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect our systems and data, whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties, it is possible we may experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of our business. Cyber threat actors could compromise our process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to our business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or our assets, disruptions in access to our financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of our critical data and proprietary information, including our intellectual property and business information and that of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and other third parties. Any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident or the full extent of such incident.\nFurther, we have exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to our critical data and proprietary information housed on third-party IT systems, including the cloud. Additionally, authorized third-party IT systems or software and open source platforms used by third parties can be compromised and used to gain access or introduce malware to our IT systems that can materially impact our business. Regardless of the precise method or form, cyber events could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition to biodiesel and RD, we store and transport petroleum-based fuels. The dangers inherent in the storage and transportation of fuels could cause disruptions in our operations and could expose us to potentially significant losses, costs or liabilities.\nWe store fuel in above ground storage tanks, underground storage tanks and transport fuel in our own trucks and rail cars as well as with third-party truck and rail carriers. Our operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in transporting and storing fuel. These hazards and risks include, but are not limited to, accidents, fires, explosions, spills, leaks, discharges, and other releases, any of which could result in distribution difficulties and disruptions, environmental pollution, governmentally-imposed fines or clean-up obligations, personal injury or wrongful death claims, and other damage to property. Any such event not covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance may not protect us against our business and operating risks.\nWe maintain insurance for some, but not all, of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business. For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance policies may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. As a result, we may not be able to renew our existing insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Although we intend to maintain insurance at levels that we believe are appropriate for our business and consistent with industry practice, we will not be fully insured against all risks. In addition, pollution, environmental risks and the risk of natural disasters generally are not fully insurable. Losses and liabilities from uninsured and underinsured events and the delay in the payment of insurance proceeds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and expect that competition in our industry will increase.\nThe bio-based diesel industry has historically been primarily comprised of smaller entities that engage exclusively in biodiesel production, large integrated agribusiness companies that produce biodiesel along with their soybean and other crop crush businesses. More recently, integrated petroleum companies have announced construction of RD facilities. We face competition for capital, labor, feedstocks and other resources from these companies. In the United States, we compete with processors, including Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Cargill, and Louis Dreyfus Commodities. In Europe, we compete directly with Greenergy, KFS, Mercuria, Neste and Sunoil. Our indirect competitors in the European market are British Petroleum, Cargill, Shell and Vitol.\nIn addition, petroleum refiners across the globe are increasingly entering into the bio-based diesel or advanced biofuels business, and many petroleum refiners are converting their existing plants to produce biofuels. Such petroleum refiners include Neste Corporation with RD production in both Asia and Europe, and Valero Energy Corporation through its Diamond Green Diesel joint venture in the United States. In addition, petroleum refiners such as British Petroleum, Eni SPA, Holly Frontier, Philips 66, Marathon Petroleum, Repsol, Saras SRS, Shell, and Total SE, have announced that they have begun or have plans to begin producing RD at a new facility or at a current refinery and/or co-processing bio-based diesel or advanced biofuels at certain of their refineries. All of these existing competitors and potential competitors may have more significant financial resources than we do and may be able to produce bio-based diesel at a lower cost or be more resilient due to their integrated operations, procurement organizations, greater refining capacity and greater financial resources.\nAccording to EIA's Short Term Energy Outlook projections, production of bio-based diesel and advanced biofuels is expected to increase by 19% in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increased production of bio-based diesel or advanced biofuels may increase the demand and prices for feedstocks and other inputs which may materially adversely affect our profitability and results of operations. For example, the combination of increasing margin pressure, driven by higher feedstock costs, and a high fixed cost lease structure made the operation of our Houston, Texas biodiesel facility economically unattractive, and as such we have shutdown of the facility.\nPetroleum companies and diesel retailers form the primary distribution networks for marketing bio-based diesel through blended petroleum-based diesel. If these companies increase their direct or indirect bio-based diesel production, including in the\nform of co-processing, there will be less need to purchase bio-based diesel and credits from independent bio-based diesel producers like us. Such a shift in the market would materially harm our operations, cash flows and profitability.\nWe are dependent upon one supplier to provide hydrogen necessary to execute our RD production process and the loss of this supplier could disrupt our production process.\nOur Geismar facility relies on one supplier to provide hydrogen necessary to execute the production process. Any disruptions to the hydrogen supply during production from this supplier will result in the shutdown of our Geismar plant operations.\nTechnological advances and changes in production methods in the bio-based diesel industry could render our plants obsolete and adversely affect our ability to compete.\nAdvances in the process of converting oils and fats into biodiesel and RD, including CPRD, could allow our competitors to produce bio-based diesel faster and more efficiently and at a substantially lower cost. In addition, we currently produce bio-based diesel to conform to or exceed standards established by the American Society for Testing and Materials (\"ASTM\"), whose standards for bio-based diesel and bio-based diesel blends may be modified in response to new technologies from the industries involved with diesel fuel.\nNew standards or production technologies may require us to make additional capital investments in, change equipment and processes, or otherwise modify plant operations to meet these standards. If we are unable to adapt or incorporate technological advances into our operations, our production facilities could become less competitive or obsolete. Further, it may be necessary for us to make significant expenditures to acquire any new technology, acquire licenses or other rights to technology and retrofit our plants in order to remain competitive. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such technologies, licenses or rights on favorable terms. If we are unable to obtain, implement or finance new technologies, our production facilities could be less efficient, and our ability to produce bio-based diesel on a competitive level may be harmed, negatively affecting our revenues and profitability.\nOur intellectual property is integral to our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or others assert that our operations violate their intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets in the United States and in select foreign countries to protect our intellectual property. Effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited, subject to challenge or not obtained in some countries.\nWe rely in part on trade secret protection to protect our knowhow, confidential and proprietary information and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, but these measures may not be effective. For example, we require new employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment or consulting arrangement with us. These agreements generally require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements also generally provide that knowhow and inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us or during the course of employment are our exclusive property. Nevertheless, these agreements may be breached, expire, or may not be enforceable, and our proprietary information may be disclosed. Despite the existence of these agreements, third parties may independently develop or acquire from others equivalent proprietary information and techniques.\nIt may be difficult to protect and enforce our intellectual property and litigation initiated to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights can be costly and time-consuming. Adverse judicial decision(s) in any legal action could limit our ability to assert our intellectual property rights, limit our ability to develop new products, limit the value of our technology, reduce the scope of coverage of our rights, or otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA competitor could seek to enforce intellectual property claims against us. Defending intellectual property claims asserted against us, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, divert management resources and attention and force us to acquire intellectual property rights and licenses, which may involve substantial royalty payments or settlement fees. Further, a third party claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay significant damages, limit our operations or obtain injunctive relief requiring a design around or other solutions and options to be developed.\nIncreases in transportation costs or disruptions in transportation services could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business depends on transportation services. The costs of these transportation services are affected by the volatility in fuel prices or other factors. Prices per Platts Group 3 (Midwest) decreased steadily in the first two months of 2020 and then plummeted to its low point in late April 2020 of $0.62 and prices slowly increased through mid-November 2020 and then increased more rapidly ending 2020 at $1.46. In 2021, the price of diesel continued to climb from $1.46 at the start of the year to $2.31 at December 31, 2021.\nOur transportation costs are also affected by U.S. oil production in the Bakkens, which has had a significant impact on tank car availability and prices. If oil production from this area increases, the demand for rail cars will rise and will significantly increase rail car prices. We have not been able in the past, and may not be able in the future, to pass along part or all of any of these price increases to customers.\nIf we continue to be unable to increase our prices as a result of increased fuel costs charged to us by transportation providers, or transportation services are unable to provide trucks due to labor shortages, work stoppages or strikes, our gross margins may be materially adversely affected. If any transportation providers fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to manufacture products on a timely basis. Shipments of products and raw materials may be delayed and any such delay or failure could harm our reputation, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon our key management personnel and other personnel, and the loss of these personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur success depends on the abilities, expertise, judgment, discretion, integrity and good faith of our management and employees. We are highly dependent upon key members of our relatively small management team and employee base that possess unique technical skills for the operation of our facilities and the execution of our business plan. The inability to retain our management team and employee base or attract suitably qualified replacements and additional staff could adversely affect our business. The loss of management and employees could delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial position.\nWe may encounter difficulties in integrating the businesses we acquire, including our international businesses where we have limited operating history.\nWe may face significant challenges in integrating entities and businesses that we acquire, and we may not realize the benefits anticipated from such acquisitions. Our integration of acquired businesses involves a number of risks, including:\n\u2022difficulty in integrating the operations and retaining of personnel, customers and suppliers of the acquired company;\n\u2022difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies, products or services with our current technologies, products or services;\n\u2022demands on management related to the increase in our size after an acquisition and integration of the acquired business and personnel;\n\u2022failure to achieve expected synergies and costs savings;\n\u2022difficulties in the assimilation of different cultures and practices, as well as in the assimilation of broad and geographically dispersed personnel and operations;\n\u2022difficulties in the integration of departments, systems, including accounting systems, technologies, books and records and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards and controls, including internal control over financial reporting, and related procedures and policies;\n\u2022the incurrence of acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results;\n\u2022the need to fund significant working capital requirements of any acquired production or other facilities;\n\u2022potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including but not limited to, issues with the acquired company\u2019s intellectual property, product quality, environmental liabilities, data back-up and security, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, employee, customer or partner issues or legal and financial contingencies;\n\u2022exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition, including but not limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, suppliers, or other third parties;\n\u2022the incurrence of significant exit charges if products or services acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful;\n\u2022challenges caused by distance, language, cultural differences, political economic and social instability;\n\u2022difficulties in protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights;\n\u2022the inability to extend proprietary rights in our technology into new jurisdictions;\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations and foreign tax consequences;\n\u2022general economic and political conditions in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022foreign exchange controls or U.S. tax laws in respect of repatriating income earned outside the United States;\n\u2022compliance with the U.S.'s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, and\n\u2022higher costs associated with doing business internationally, such as those associated with complying with export, import regulations and trade and tariff restrictions.\nOur failure to successfully manage and integrate our acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our operating results, ability to recognize international revenue, and our overall financial condition.\nWe incur significant expenses to maintain and upgrade our operating equipment and plants, and any interruption in the operation of our facilities may harm our operating performance.\nThe facilities, processes, machines and equipment that we use to produce our products are complex, have many parts and some operate on a continuous basis. We must perform routine maintenance on our equipment and will have to periodically replace a variety of parts, consumables and components. In addition, our facilities require periodic shutdowns to perform major maintenance, consumable replacement and upgrades. Other equipment may have a long lead time requirement if equipment is damaged and needs to be replaced or may otherwise be unavailable to continue operations. These scheduled shutdowns of facilities result in decreased sales and increased costs in the periods in which a shutdown occurs and could result in unexpected operational issues as a result of changes to equipment, operational and mechanical processes made during the shutdown.\nGrowth in the use, sale and distribution of biodiesel is dependent on the expansion of related infrastructure which may not occur on a timely basis, if at all, and our operations could be adversely affected by infrastructure limitations or disruptions.\nWhile RD has a similar chemical composition as petroleum diesel and can utilize the same distribution infrastructure, biodiesel has a different chemical composition and may require separate or additional infrastructure. Growth in the biodiesel market depends on continued development and expansion of infrastructure for the distribution of biodiesel, which may or may not occur and which is outside of our control. Also, we compete with other biofuel companies for access to some of the key infrastructure components, and the increased production of biodiesel will increase the demand and competition for necessary infrastructure. Any delay or failure in expanding distribution infrastructure could hurt the demand for or prices of biodiesel, impede delivery of our biodiesel, and impose additional costs, each of which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to seasonal changes based on regulatory factors and weather conditions and this seasonality could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate.\nOur operating results are influenced by seasonal fluctuations in the price of and demand for bio-based diesel. Seasonal fluctuations may be based on both the weather and the status of both the BTC and RVO.\nDemand for our bio-based diesel may be higher in the quarters leading up to the expiration of the BTC as customers seek to purchase bio-based diesel when they can benefit from the agreed upon value sharing of the BTC with producers. This higher demand prompted by an expiring BTC has often resulted in reduced demand for biodiesel in the following quarter. In addition, RIN prices may also be subject to seasonal fluctuations. The RIN is dated for the calendar year in which it is generated. Since 20% of an obligated party's annual RVO can be satisfied by prior year RINs, most RINs must come from biofuel produced or imported during the RVO year. As a result, RIN prices can be expected to increase as the calendar year progresses if the RIN market is undersupplied compared to that year's RVO and decrease if it is oversupplied.\nWeather also impacts our business because biodiesel typically has a higher cloud point than petroleum-based or RD. The cloud point is the temperature below which a fuel exhibits a noticeable cloudiness and eventually gels, leading to fuel handling and performance problems for customers and suppliers. Reduced demand in the winter for our higher cloud point biodiesel may result in excess supply of such higher cloud point biodiesel and lower prices for such higher cloud point biodiesel. Most of our production facilities are located in colder Midwestern states and our costs of shipping biodiesel to warmer climates generally increase in cold weather months.\nThe tendency of biodiesel to gel in colder weather may also result in long-term storage problems. In cold climates, fuel may need to be stored in a heated building or heated storage tanks, which results in higher storage costs. Higher cloud point biodiesel may have other performance problems, including the possibility of particulate formation above the cloud point which may result in increased expenses as we try to remedy these performance problems, including the costs of extra cold weather treatment additives. Remedying these performance problems may result in decreased yields, lower process throughput or both, as well as substantial capital costs. Any reduction in the demand for our biodiesel product, or the production capacity of our facilities will reduce our revenues and have an adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with governmental and state regulations, including EPA requirements relating to RFS2, BTC, LCFS and other programs or new laws designed to deal with climate change, could result in the imposition of higher costs, penalties, fines, or restrictions on our operations and remedial liabilities.\nThe bio-based diesel industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, and we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination, and regardless of whether current or prior operations were conducted consistent with the accepted standards of practice. Many of our assets and plants were acquired from third parties and we may incur costs to remediate property contamination caused by previous owners. In addition, we are subject to similar laws and regulations in Europe and Canada for the renewable fuels we sell there. Compliance with these laws, regulations and obligations could require substantial capital expenditures.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and changes resulting in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance. In January 2021, the Biden Administration issued an executive order directing all federal agencies to review and take action to address any federal regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies and any similar agency actions promulgated during the prior administration that may be inconsistent with the current administration's policies. As a result, it is unclear the degree to which certain recent regulatory developments may be modified, extended, or rescinded.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable attention globally. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional, state and local levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHGs as well as to restrict or eliminate future emissions. In January 2021, the Biden Administration issued another executive order focused on addressing climate change. Among other things, the 2021 climate change executive order directed the federal government to identify \"fossil fuel subsidies\" to take steps to ensure that, to the extent consistent with applicable law, federal funding is not directly subsidizing fossil fuels. As a result, our operations are subject to a series of regulatory, litigation and financial risks associated with the production and transportation of biofuel products and emission of GHGs. The potential effects of GHG emission limits on our business are subject to significant uncertainties based on, among other things, the timing of the implementation of any new requirements, the required levels of emission reductions, and the nature of any market-based or tax-based mechanisms adopted to facilitate reductions. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations relating to climate change could increase our costs of operating and could require us to make significant financial expenditures that cannot be predicted with certainty at this time. We are subject to various laws and regulations including RFS2, BTC, LCFS, and other jurisdictions. These regulations are highly complex and continuously evolving, requiring us to periodically update our systems to maintain compliance, which could require significant expenditures. In 2014, the EPA issued a final rule to establish a quality assurance program and also implemented regulations related to the generation and sale of bio-based diesel RINs. Any violation of these regulations by us, could result in significant fines and harm our customers\u2019 confidence in the RINs we issue, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRD fuel is superior to biodiesel in certain respects and if RD production capacity increases to a sufficient extent, it could largely supplant biodiesel; we may not be successful in expanding our RD production capacity.\nRD is not as widely available as biodiesel, but it has certain characteristics that favorably distinguish it from biodiesel and as a result RD carries a price premium compared to biodiesel. For example, RD has similar chemical properties to petroleum-based diesel, which permits 100% RD (unlike 100% biodiesel) to flow through the same fuel storage and distribution network as petroleum diesel. RD can be used in its pure form in modern engines rather than as a blend with petroleum diesel and has similar cold weather performance as petroleum diesel. RD and CPRD may receive 1.6 or 1.7 RINs per gallon, whereas biodiesel receives 1.5 RINs per gallon. As the value of RINs increases, this RIN advantage makes RD more valuable. If RD proves to be preferred over biodiesel by market participants, revenues from our biodiesel plants and our results of operations would be adversely impacted.\nNitrogen oxide emissions from biodiesel may harm its appeal as a renewable fuel and increase costs.\nIn some instances, biodiesel may increase emissions of nitrogen oxide as compared to petroleum-based diesel fuel, which could harm air quality. Nitrogen oxide is a contributor to ozone and smog. While newer diesel engines are believed to eliminate any such increase, emissions from older vehicles may decrease the appeal of biodiesel to environmental groups and agencies who have been historic supporters of the biodiesel industry, potentially harming our ability to market biodiesel.\nIn addition, several states may act to regulate potential nitrogen oxide emissions from biodiesel. California adopted regulations that limit the volume of biodiesel that can be used or requires an additive to reduce potential emissions. In states where such an additive is required to sell biodiesel, an additive may not be available or if available, the additional cost of the additive may make biodiesel less profitable or make biodiesel less cost competitive against petroleum-based diesel or RD, which in each case would negatively impact our ability to sell biodiesel in such states and therefore have an adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nEffective August 1, 2021, under California's Alternative Diesel Fuel regulation, existing additives used to mitigate biodiesel NOX emissions above B5 will no longer be available. This change may negatively impact demand for biodiesel in California and reduce our revenue and profit.\nIn addition, there may also be other requirements of fleet and retail fueling station owners to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. The requirements relate to the type of vehicle and age of the vehicle. These requirements could result in additional costs for the operators and therefore may make the use of biodiesel less attractive, which could negatively affect our ability to sell biodiesel in such states and therefore have an adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS\nWe and certain subsidiaries have indebtedness, which subjects us to potential defaults, that could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limits our ability to react to changes in the economy or the bio-based diesel industry.\nAt December 31, 2021, our total term debt before debt issuance costs was $550.0 million, representing the aggregate carrying value on our $550.0 million face amount, 5.875% Senior Secured Green Note due 2028, which we refer to as the \u201cGreen Notes\u201d. At December 31, 2021, we had $249.7 million of unused revolving commitments under our line of credit, subject to borrowing base limitations.\nOur indebtedness could:\n\u25e6make it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the Green Notes, the M&L and Services Revolver and any other future indebtedness and contractual and commercial commitments;\n\u25e6require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments of principal, interest on, and other fees related to such indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes;\n\u25e6limit our ability to borrow, or increase our cost of borrowing, additional funds;\n\u25e6prevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase Green Notes tendered to us if there is a change of control; a change of control which would also constitute a default under the M&L and Services Revolver under the Indenture, dated as of May 20, 2021, pursuant to which the Green Notes were issued (the \"Indenture\");\n\u25e6increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and bio-based diesel industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our revolving credit facilities are and will continue to be at variable interest rates, and\n\u25e6limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the bio-based diesel industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future financial performance, which is subject to several factors including economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or any future indebtedness we may incur as well as our ability to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our existing or future indebtedness will depend on the conditions in the capital markets and our financial condition prior to maturity of the indebtedness.\nOur debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.\nThe M&L and Services Revolver and the Indenture impose significant operating and financial restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries. These restrictions limit certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness or issue certain disqualified stock and preferred stock;\n\u2022place restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us;\n\u2022grant certain additional liens on our assets or permit them to exist;\n\u2022redeem or repurchase equity securities;\n\u2022make certain investments, including acquisitions of substantially all or a portion of another entity\u2019s business assets;\n\u2022engage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022guarantee indebtedness; and\n\u2022create liens.\nSubject to the terms of the intercreditor agreement entered into in connection with the issuance of the Green Notes, when (and for as long as) the availability under the M&L and Services Revolver is less than a specified amount for a certain period of time, funds deposited into certain deposit accounts used for collections will be transferred on a daily basis into a blocked account with the administrative agent and applied to prepay loans under the M&L and Services Revolver.\nAs a result of these covenants and restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants, including on us and/or our subsidiaries that are not obligors under the M&L and Services Revolver. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.\nThere are limitations on our ability to utilize the full amount of revolving commitments under the M&L and Services Revolver. Currently, the maximum aggregate principal amount that we may borrow under the M&L and Services Revolver is $250.0 million. In addition, the commitments of the lenders under the M&L and Services Revolver is further limited by a specified borrowing base consisting of a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory, less customary reserves. In addition, under the M&L and Services Revolver, a monthly fixed charge coverage ratio would be triggered if availability under the M&L and Services Revolver is less than 10% of the then current revolving loan commitments which equates to $25 million. At December 31, 2021, the M&L and Services Revolver had approximately $249.7 million of unused revolving commitments, after the effect of borrowing base limitations. However, it is possible that availability under the M&L and Services Revolver could fall below the applicable threshold in a future period. If the covenant testing period is triggered, our subsidiaries who are the borrowers under the M&L and Services Revolver would be required to satisfy and maintain on the last day of each month a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.0 to 1.0 for the preceding twelve-month period.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the fixed charge coverage ratio for the M&L and Services Revolver was above 1.0, which is the minimum amount required for compliance with this ratio. As noted above, we are not required to comply with the minimum fixed charge covenant of 1.0 unless availability under the M&L and Services Revolver drops below the agreed threshold. Our ability to meet the required fixed charge coverage ratio can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet this ratio. A breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under the M&L and Services Revolver.\nWe may still incur significant additional indebtedness that could increase the risks associated with our indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future. As of December 31, 2021, we had $249.7 million of unused revolving commitments under the M&L and Services Revolver, subject to borrowing base limitations. We currently expect to fund the estimated $950 million of capital expenditures in connection with the improvement and expansion of our Geismar, Louisiana facility with a combination of cash on hand, marketable securities, borrowings under our credit facilities, offerings of equity and debt (including the equity offering completed in March 2021 and the offering of the Green Notes completed in May 2021) or from other sources. If we are unable to complete the improvement and expansion within the estimated budget, we will require additional funds to do so. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify. Additionally, debt financing arrangements may also be rated by credit rating agencies. Any potential future negative change in our credit ratings may make it more expensive for us to raise long term permanent financing or additional capital on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all; negatively impact the price of our common stock; increase our overall cost of capital; and have other negative implications on our business, many of which are beyond our control.\nCertain provisions in the Indenture governing our Senior Secured Green Notes (the \"Green Notes\") could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us.\nCertain provisions in the Indenture could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. If a takeover triggers a \u201cChange of Control\u201d as defined under the Indenture, each holder of the Green Notes will have the right to\nrequire us to repurchase their Green Notes in cash, at a price equal to 101.0% of the aggregate principal amount to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not including the date of repurchase, which could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management. If we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements, there could be a default under the terms of such agreements, which could result in an acceleration of repayment.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022changes in the performance or market valuations of other companies engaged in our industry;\n\u2022issuance of new or updated research reports by securities or industry analysts;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates by us or of securities or industry analysts;\n\u2022investors\u2019 general perception of us and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022investors' reactions to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022changes in the political climate in the industry in which we operate, existing laws, regulations and policies applicable to our business and products, including RFS2, and the continuation or adoption or failure to continue or adopt renewable energy requirements and incentives, including the BTC;\n\u2022other regulatory developments in our industry affecting us, our customers or our competitors;\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u2022announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts, including sales or expected sales of additional common stock;\n\u2022additions or departures of key management or other personnel;\n\u2022litigation involving us or our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022inadequate trading volume;\n\u2022general market conditions in our industry;\n\u2022the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures to address the pandemic;\n\u2022whether our shares are included in stock market indexes such as the S&P SmallCap 600 index; and\n\u2022general economic and market conditions, including continued dislocations and downward pressure in the capital markets.\nIn addition, stock markets experience significant price and volume fluctuations from time to time that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may have material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. Any securities litigation that may be instituted against us in the future could result in substantial costs, regardless of the outcome of the litigation, and divert resources and our management's attention to our business. In addition, the occurrence of any of the factors listed above, among others, may cause our stock price to decline significantly, and there can be no assurance that our stock price would recover. As such, you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid dividends on any of our capital stock and currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. As a result, stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment. This appreciation may not occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock. Furthermore, we may in the future become subject to contractual restrictions on, or prohibitions against, the payment of dividends.\nWe may issue additional common stock as consideration for future investments or acquisitions.\nWe have issued in the past, and may issue in the future, our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions. Our stockholders could suffer significant dilution, from our issuances of equity or convertible debt securities. Any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. The amount of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting and financial forecasting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, provide accurate financial guidance or prevent fraud, and if we fail to maintain effective internal governance and conduct policies, such as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers and Trading by Insiders Policy, or if our employees fail to adhere to such policies, we may be unable to maintain a proper control environment. If any of these failures occur, our business could be harmed, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting and financial guidance or our business integrity and we could suffer negative media attention, which could negatively impact the value of our stock.\nEffective internal controls over our financial reporting and adherence to our internal governance and conduct policies are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to prevent fraud. The process of maintaining our internal controls may be expensive and time consuming and may require significant attention from management. The failure to do so may harm our business or our reputation and could negatively impact the value of our stock. Even if our management concludes that, as of the end of a fiscal quarter or fiscal year, our internal control over financial reporting provided reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements.\nIn addition, failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the disclosure of that weakness could harm the value of our stock and our business.\nAs a result of the matters discussed in the explanatory note to the Form 10-K/A filed by us on February 25, 2021, we concluded that our previously issued audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, each of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarterly and year-to-date periods during such years, and related disclosures, as well as our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the quarterly periods ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2020, should be restated. Two class action lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our current and former executive officers following the restatements. As a result of these restatements and the errors that resulted in these restatements, we are subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including potential additional litigation and loss of investor confidence.\nOn July 27, 2021, a stockholder derivative complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware based on allegations substantially similar to those in the class action, and purporting to assert claims on the Company's behalf against current and former officers and directors for alleged violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets. On January 20, 2022, the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss with prejudice and entered a judgment dismissing the case. On February 18, 2022, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal of the order granting the motion to dismiss and the entry of judgement.\nIn connection with this restatement of our historical consolidated financial statements, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2020, which has been remediated as of December 31, 2021.\nIf we are unsuccessful in remediating any future material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting and disclosures and our business, reputation, results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, ability to access the capital markets, perceptions of our creditworthiness, and ability to complete acquisitions could be adversely affected. In addition, we may be unable to maintain or regain compliance with applicable securities laws, stock market listing requirements, and the covenants under our debt instruments regarding the timely filing of periodic reports; we may be subject to penalties; we may suffer defaults or accelerations under our debt instruments to the extent we are unable to obtain waivers from the required creditors or counterparties or are unable to cure any breaches; and our stock price may decline.\nFurther, effective financial forecasting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial guidance. The process of providing accurate financial guidance may be expensive and time consuming, may require significant attention from management, and is inherently uncertain. Nevertheless, the failure to do so accurately may harm our business or our reputation and could negatively\nimpact the value of our stock. For example, in the second quarter of 2020, we identified errors in our financial guidance model that led to our June 23, 2020 announcement of a revised outlook for the second quarter of 2020, which announcement was followed by a drop in the price of our stock.\nIt is also necessary for our employees, and in particular our senior officers, to adhere to all of our internal governance and conduct policies, including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers and Trading by Insiders Policy. Failure to adhere to our policies could result in negative media attention or otherwise harm our reputation and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our business integrity or management. For example, in connection with an internal investigation into the series of events that led to our June 23, 2020 announcement of a revised outlook for the second quarter of 2020, we uncovered certain violations of our policies by senior officers, which resulted in disciplinary actions and remediations for the officers involved. The investigation also prompted a review of all of our internal policies and codes of ethics, which is resulting in a number of revisions intended to further strengthen them and their associated assurance processes. Any failure to maintain these policies or failure by our employees, and in particular our senior officers, to adhere to these policies could still result in harm to our reputation and could negatively impact the value of our stock.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022the right of the board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors;\n\u2022the requirement for advance notice for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting;\n\u2022the ability of the board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u2022the ability of the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with rights set by the board of directors, which rights could be senior to those of common stock;\n\u2022a classified board;\n\u2022the required approval of holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws or amend or repeal the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding the classified board, the election and removal of directors and the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent; and\n\u2022the elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to take action by written consent.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\"DGCL\"). These provisions may prohibit or restrict large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us. These provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in our market price being lower than it would without these provisions.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE PROPOSED MERGER\nThe proposed Merger is subject to approval of our stockholders as well as the satisfaction of other closing conditions, including government consents and approvals, some or all of which may not be satisfied or completed within the expected timeframe, if at all.\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to a number of closing conditions, including obtaining the approval of our stockholders, the expiration or termination of any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act and the EU Clearance. We can provide no assurance that all required consents and approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), and, even if all required consents and approvals can be obtained and all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), we can provide no assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents and approvals or the timing of the completion of the Merger. Many of the conditions to completion of the Merger are not within our control, and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable). Any adverse consequence of the pending Merger could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nEach party\u2019s obligation to consummate the Merger is also subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party (subject to customary materiality qualifications) and compliance in all material respects with the covenants and\nagreements contained in the Merger Agreement as of the closing of the Merger, including, with respect to us, covenants to conduct our business in the ordinary course and to not engage in certain kinds of material transactions prior to closing. In addition, the Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain specified circumstances, including, but not limited to, in connection with a change in the recommendation of our Board of Directors to enter into an agreement for a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement). As a result, we cannot assure you that the Merger will be completed, even if our stockholders approve the Merger, or that, if completed, it will be exactly on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement or within the expected time frame.\nWe may not complete the proposed Merger within the time frame we anticipate or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and/or operations.\nThe proposed Merger may not be completed within the expected timeframe, or at all, as a result of various factors and conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. If the Merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of our stockholders failing to adopt the Merger Agreement, our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of our common stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, we will remain a public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market and registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and we will be required to continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Moreover, our ongoing business may be materially adversely affected, and we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price, and it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of the shares would return to the prices at which the shares currently trade;\n\u2022we may experience negative publicity, which could have an adverse effect on our ongoing operations including, but not limited to, retaining and attracting employees, customers, partners, suppliers and others with whom we do business;\n\u2022we will still be required to pay certain significant costs relating to the Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory, printing and other professional services fees, which may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than in connection with the Merger;\n\u2022we may be required to pay a cash termination fee to Parent of $91.0 million, as required under the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances;\n\u2022while the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain kinds of material transactions, which could prevent us from pursuing strategic business opportunities, taking actions with respect to our business that we may consider advantageous and responding effectively and/or timely to competitive pressures and industry developments, and may as a result materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition;\n\u2022matters relating to the Merger require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could result in the distraction of management from ongoing business operations and pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us; and\n\u2022we may commit significant time and resources to defending against litigation related to the Merger.\nIf the Merger is not consummated, the risks described above may materialize, and they may have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial results and stock price, particularly to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed.\nWe will be subject to various uncertainties while the Merger is pending that may cause disruption and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers and other third-party business partners.\nOur efforts to complete the Merger could cause substantial disruptions in, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business, which may materially adversely affect our results of operation and our business. Uncertainty as to whether the Merger will be completed may affect our ability to recruit prospective employees or to retain and motivate existing employees. Employee retention may be particularly challenging while the Merger is pending because employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the Merger. As mentioned above, a substantial amount of our management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention is being directed toward the completion of the Merger and thus is being diverted from our day-to-day operations. Uncertainty as to our future could adversely affect our business and our relationship with customers and potential customers. For example, customers, suppliers and other third parties may defer decisions concerning working with us, or seek to change existing business relationships with us. Changes to or termination of existing business relationships could adversely affect our revenue, earnings and financial condition, as well as the market price of our common stock. The adverse effects of the pendency of the Merger could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nIn certain instances, the Merger Agreement requires us to pay a termination fee to Parent, which could affect the decisions of a third party considering making an alternative acquisition proposal.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $91.0 million under specified conditions, including in the event Parent terminates the Merger Agreement before receipt of our stockholders\u2019 approval due to a change in recommendation by our Board of Directors, in the event we terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a Superior Proposal, or in the event we enter into an alternative transaction within twelve months of termination of the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances and the alternative transaction is consummated. This payment could affect the structure, pricing and terms proposed by a third party seeking to acquire or merge with us and could discourage a third party from making a competing acquisition proposal, including a proposal that would be more favorable to our stockholders than the Merger.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, direct and indirect costs as a result of the Merger.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs and expenses, including regulatory costs, fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger, for which we will have received little or no benefit if the Merger is not completed. There are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these costs and expenses. Many of these fees and costs will be payable by us even if the Merger is not completed and may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than to complete the Merger.\nLitigation challenging the Merger Agreement may prevent the Merger from being consummated within the expected timeframe or at all.\nLawsuits may be filed against us, our Board of Directors or other parties to the Merger Agreement, challenging our acquisition by Parent making other claims in connection therewith. Such lawsuits may be brought by our purported stockholders and may seek, among other things, to enjoin consummation of the Merger. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that the consummation of the Merger is not restrained, made illegal, enjoined or prohibited by any order or legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition of a court of competent jurisdiction or any governmental entity. As such, if the plaintiffs in such potential lawsuits are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the defendants from completing the Merger on the agreed upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the Merger from becoming effective, or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.", "PERMNO": 13201, "SIC": 2990, "TIC": "REGI"}
