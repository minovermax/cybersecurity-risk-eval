{"cik": "1506492", "company": "Sunshine Heart, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business faces many risks. We believe the risks described below are the material risks we face. However, the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional unknown risks or risks that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our shares of common stock could decline significantly. Investors should consider the specific risk factors discussed below, together with the \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other documents that we will file from time to time with the SEC.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have incurred operating losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are an early-stage company with a history of incurring net losses. We have incurred net losses since our inception, including net losses of $26.6 million, $25.6 million, and $21.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit was $153.2 million. We do not have any products that have been approved for marketing in the United States, we have not established any sales capability outside of the United States, and we continue to incur research and development and general and administrative expenses related to our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we incur costs associated with the conduct of clinical studies and our research and development programs (including, in particular, in connection with our next-generation, fully-implantable system and research regarding the potential neuromodulatory effect of the system), seek regulatory approvals, expand our sales and marketing capabilities, increase manufacturing of our system and comply with the requirements related to being a U.S. public company listed on NASDAQ. To become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and commercializing products with significant market potential. This will require us to succeed in a range of challenging activities, including conducting clinical studies, obtaining regulatory approvals, manufacturing products and marketing and selling commercial products. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in these activities, and we may never generate revenues sufficient to achieve profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm issued in connection with its audit of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We will need additional funding to continue operations, which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all.\nWe have no products currently available for commercial sale in the United States and, although we have CE Mark, we have not commenced commercial sales in the European Union, and we have terminated enrollment in our OPTIONS HF clinical trial in the European Union. To date, we have generated only limited revenue from our clinical studies, and since we are no longer enrolling in our OPTIONS HF and COUNTER HF clinical trials, we have no current source of revenue to sustain our present activities. We do not expect to generate any revenue from clinical trials in during 2016. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm issued in connection with its audit of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we incur costs associated with the conduct of clinical studies and our research and development programs (including, in particular, in connection with our next-generation, fully-implantable system and research regarding the potential neuromodulatory effect of the system), seek regulatory approvals, expand our sales and marketing capabilities, increase manufacturing of our system and comply with the requirements related to being a U.S. public company listed on NASDAQ. Substantial additional funding will be needed and may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. In addition, the risk that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult to obtain necessary additional funding on terms favorable to us, or at all. We expect to seek additional financing during the second half of fiscal 2016. If we raise additional funding through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders may suffer dilution and our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future income may be limited. If we raise additional funding through debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, require us to use our cash to make payments under such indebtedness, force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios or restrict our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions. If we are unable to secure additional funding, our development programs and our commercialization efforts would be delayed, reduced or eliminated, our relationships with our suppliers and manufacturers may be harmed, and we may not be able to continue our operations.\nOur near-term prospects are highly dependent on the development of a single product, the C-Pulse System. If we fail to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to sell the C-Pulse System or fail to successfully commercialize this system, our business and prospects would be harmed significantly.\nOur near-term prospects are highly dependent on the development of a single product, the C-Pulse System, and we have no other product candidates in active development at this time. We are in the process of pursuing regulatory approvals necessary to sell our system in the United States, which we believe has the largest market potential for our product. We completed enrollment of our North American feasibility clinical study in the first half of 2011. In November 2011, we announced the preliminary results of the six-month follow-up period for the feasibility study and we submitted the clinical data to the FDA. In March 2012, the FDA notified us that it had completed its review of the C-Pulse System feasibility study data and concluded we met the applicable agency requirements, and further indicated that we could move forward with an IDE application. In November 2012, the FDA provided us with unconditional approval to initiate a pivotal study. The COUNTER HF\u2122 study was designed to enroll 388 patients randomized 1:1 to treatment (C-Pulse implantation) versus optimal medical therapy, at up to 40 participating hospitals and clinics. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was defined as freedom from worsening heart failure resulting in hospitalization, LVAD implantation, cardiac transplantation or heart failure related death. We commenced enrollment in COUNTER HF in September 2013. In February 2015, we announced that we had received unconditional approval from the FDA to conduct an interim analysis of COUNTER HF, which could have reduced the overall duration of the trial. In March 2015, we announced that COUNTER HF had reached a pre-determined pausing point and we temporarily suspended enrollment in accordance with the study protocol. In May 2015, we announced that the FDA had approved resumption of patient enrollment in the study and we began the process of reactivating clinical sites and of resuming enrollment of patients into the study. We concluded 2015 with 66 enrollments, 35 randomizations, 29 activated centers, and 9 additional centers committed to participate. On March 3, 2016, we announced that we are no longer enrolling patients into the COUNTER HF and OPTIONS HF studies and that we plan to pursue a new strategic direction, as discussed under Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness-Our Strategy\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to sell our system. In addition, even if we obtain such regulatory approvals, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully commercialize our system. If we fail to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to sell our system or fail to successfully commercialize our system, our business and prospects would be harmed significantly.\nWe will need to raise additional capital in the future. If additional capital is not available, we will have to delay, reduce or cease operations.\nAlthough we believe that our cash on hand will fund our operations until sometime in the second half of 2016 while remaining in compliance with the terms of our loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, we need to raise additional capital to continue to fund the further development of the C-Pulse System and our operations thereafter. As such, we expect to seek additional financing during the second half of 2016. Changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate and could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. Additional financing may not be available when we need it or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis or at all, we may breach our liquidity covenant under our loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, in which case, we would be required to immediately pledge to the bank and thereafter maintain in a separate account, unrestricted cash in an amount equal to 50% of the amount then outstanding under the loan agreement. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis or at all, we would likely be required to significantly reduce our operations and may not be able to continue the development of the C-Pulse System.\nWe may not be able to correctly estimate or control our future operating expenses, which could lead to cash shortfalls.\nOur operating expenses may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include:\n\u00b7 the time and resources required to further develop, conduct clinical studies, and obtain reimbursement and regulatory approvals for, our products;\n\u00b7 the expenses we incur for the research and development required to maintain and improve our system, develop the next-generation, fully-implantable system and research the potential neuromodulatory effect of the system;\n\u00b7 the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation;\n\u00b7 the expenses we incur in connection with commercialization activities, including marketing, sales and distribution;\n\u00b7 our sales strategy and whether the revenues from sales of our system will be sufficient to offset our expenses;\n\u00b7 the costs to attract and retain personnel with the skills required for effective operations; and\n\u00b7 the costs associated with being a public company.\nWe may be unable to reduce our expenditures in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in financing. Accordingly, a significant shortfall in available financing could have an immediate and material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur loan agreement subjects us to operating restrictions and financial covenants that impose risk of default and may restrict our business and financing activities.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $8.0 million outstanding under our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. Borrowings under this agreement are secured by a security interest in all of our assets and our current and future subsidiaries, including a security interest in intellectual property proceeds, but excluding a current security interest in intellectual property. The agreement contains customary representations (tested on a continual basis) and covenants that, subject to exceptions, restrict our ability to do the following things: declare dividends or redeem or repurchase equity interests; incur additional liens; make loans and investments; incur additional indebtedness; engage in mergers, acquisitions, and asset sales; transact with affiliates; undergo a change in control; add or change business locations; and engage in businesses that are not related to its existing business. In December 2015, we agreed to an amendment of the loan agreement that removed the requirement to raise a minimum of $20.0 million in unencumbered net cash proceeds from the issuance and sale of our equity securities by March 31, 2016 but added a liquidity covenant requiring us to maintain cash and cash equivalents in an amount equal to or greater than eight times our monthly cash burn amount.\nThese covenants may restrict our ability to finance our operations and to pursue our business activities and strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we are not compliant with certain covenants, there is no guarantee that the bank will waive any noncompliance or agree to amend certain covenants in the future. If a default were to occur and not be waived, such default could cause, among other remedies, all of the outstanding indebtedness under our loan agreement to become immediately due and payable. In such an event, our liquid assets might not be sufficient to meet our repayment obligations, and we might be forced to liquidate collateral assets at unfavorable prices or our assets may be foreclosed upon and sold at unfavorable valuations.\nWe depend on a limited number of manufacturers and suppliers of various critical components for the C-Pulse System. The loss of any of these manufacturer or supplier relationships could delay future clinical studies or prevent or delay commercialization of the C-Pulse System.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture the C-Pulse System and to supply us with all of the critical components of the C-Pulse System, including the balloon, driver, cuff and interface lead. We primarily purchase our components and products on a purchase order basis and do not \u201csecond source\u201d any components of our system. If one or more of the suppliers of the components used in our system were unable or unwilling to meet our demand for such components or faced financial or business difficulties in general, or if the components or finished products provided by any of our suppliers do not meet quality and other specifications, clinical studies or commercialization of our system could be delayed and our expenses could increase. Moreover, if any of the suppliers were unable or unwilling to perform, we would be required to find alternative sources for the components provided by such supplier, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to find a replacement supplier on a timely basis, or at all. In particular, the balloon used in our system is highly specialized and is currently solely available from a single supplier. If the manufacturer of the balloon were unable or unwilling to supply this component for any reason, we would have to locate and qualify another supplier and such supplier and its balloon product would have to be qualified under FDA and European regulations and would require FDA and European submissions, such as IDE supplements, PMA supplements and change notifications. Since there is currently no other supplier in the industry, locating and qualifying another supplier could cause significant production delays, causing us to lose revenues and market share and to potentially suffer increased costs and damage to our reputation. Additionally, even if we are able to find a replacement supplier of any of the components used in our system, we may face additional regulatory delays, and the manufacture and delivery of the C-Pulse System could be interrupted for an extended period of time and become significantly more expensive. This could delay completion of future clinical studies or commercialization of the C-Pulse System and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may be required to use different suppliers or components to obtain regulatory approval from the FDA or other regulatory agencies.\nIf our manufacturers or our suppliers are unable to provide an adequate supply of our system if our system is approved for commercialization, our growth could be limited and our business could be harmed.\nIn order to produce the C-Pulse System in the quantities that may be required to meet market demand if the system is approved for commercialization, we will need our manufacturers to increase, or scale-up, the production process by a significant factor over the current level of production. There are technical challenges to scaling-up manufacturing capacity and developing commercial-scale manufacturing facilities that may require the investment of substantial additional funds by our manufacturers and hiring and retaining additional management and technical personnel who have the necessary manufacturing experience. If our manufacturers are unable to do so, we may not be able to meet the requirements for the launch of the system or to meet future demand, if at all. We also may represent only a small portion of our supplier\u2019s or manufacturer\u2019s business, and if they become capacity constrained they may choose to allocate their available resources to other customers that represent a larger portion of their businesses. We currently anticipate that we will continue to rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for the production of the C-Pulse System if our system is approved for commercialization. If we obtain regulatory approval for our system and are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of our system, our revenue, business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be harmed.\nIf we are unable to manage our expected growth, we may not be able to commercialize our system.\nWe expect to expand our operations and grow our research and development, product development, regulatory, manufacturing, sales, marketing and administrative operations in connection with a new strategic direction in the future and as our development of our system progresses. This expansion places a significant strain on our management and operational and financial resources. To manage any growth and to commercialize our system, if approved, we will be required to improve existing and implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls and expand, train and manage our growing employee base. In addition, we will need to manage relationships with various manufacturers, suppliers and other organizations. Our ability to manage our operations and growth will require us to improve our operational, financial and management controls, as well as our internal reporting systems and controls, all of which will involve significant expense. We may not be able to implement such improvements to our management information and internal control systems in an efficient and timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. Our failure to accomplish any of these tasks could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe compete against many companies, some of which have longer operating histories, more established products and greater resources than we do, which may prevent us from achieving further market penetration or improving operating results.\nCompetition from medical device companies and medical device divisions of health care companies, as well as pharmaceutical companies and gene- and cell-based therapies is intense and is expected to increase. Our system will compete against therapies, including pharmacological therapies, as well as other medical device competitors that treat or may treat in the future Class III or\nambulatory Class IV heart failure patients, including Berlin HeartGmbH, HeartWare International Inc., Jarvik Heart, Inc., ReliantHeart, Inc., and St. Jude Medical Corporation, as well as a range of other specialized medical device companies with devices at varying stages of development. Some of these competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources than we do and have established reputations, as well as worldwide distribution channels and sales and marketing capabilities that are significantly larger and more established than ours. Additional competitors may enter the market, and we are likely to compete with new companies in the future. We also face competition from other medical therapies which may focus on our target market as well as competition from manufacturers of pharmaceutical and other devices that have not yet been developed. Competition from these companies could harm our business. In addition, because our system has been implanted in a limited number of patients to date, all of the material risks and potential competitive disadvantages of our system are not necessarily known at this time.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to distinguish our Company and our system from our competitors and their products. Factors affecting our competitive position include:\n\u00b7 financial resources;\n\u00b7 product performance and design;\n\u00b7 product safety;\n\u00b7 acceptance of our system in the marketplace;\n\u00b7 sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u00b7 manufacturing and assembly costs;\n\u00b7 pricing of our system and of our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u00b7 the availability of reimbursement from government and private health insurers;\n\u00b7 success and timing of new product development and introductions;\n\u00b7 regulatory approvals in the United States; and\n\u00b7 intellectual property protection.\nWe currently have limited sales, marketing or established distribution operations and will need to expand our expertise in these areas.\nWe currently have limited sales, marketing or established distribution operations and, in connection with the expected commercialization of our system, will need to expand our expertise in these areas. To increase internal sales, distribution and marketing expertise and be able to conduct these operations, we would have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources. In developing these functions ourselves, we could face a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 we may not be able to attract and build an effective marketing or sales force;\n\u00b7 the cost of establishing, training and providing regulatory oversight for a marketing or sales force may be substantial; and\n\u00b7 there are significant legal and regulatory risks in medical device marketing and sales that we have never faced, and any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements for sales, marketing and distribution could result in an enforcement action by the FDA, European regulators or other authorities that could jeopardize our ability to market the system or could subject us to substantial liability.\nWe previously pursued a post-market clinical study in certain European countries in addition to the United States. We plan to seek approval to commercialize our system outside of the United States, which exposes us to risks associated with international operations.\nWe plan to commercialize our system outside of the United States and previously pursued a post-market clinical study in certain European countries in addition to the United States, although we are no longer enrolling patients in our OPTIONS HF study. Conducting international operations subjects us to risks, including:\n\u00b7 costs of complying with varying regulatory requirements and potential, unexpected changes to those requirements;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in and management of currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7 difficulties in selling in countries where other companies and their products may be more established, have greater brand recognition and a history of selling multiple product lines to our target customers;\n\u00b7 potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u00b7 government-imposed pricing controls on sales of our system;\n\u00b7 longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7 difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\n\u00b7 the burdens of complying with a wide variety of non-U.S. laws and legal standards;\n\u00b7 increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; and\n\u00b7 reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nThe occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect our international operations. Additionally, operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot be certain that our operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenues or profitability.\nThe competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in our industry. If we are unable to retain or hire key personnel, we may not be able to sustain or grow our business.\nOur ability to operate successfully and manage our potential future growth depends significantly upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified research, technical, clinical, regulatory, sales, marketing, managerial and financial personnel. We face intense competition for such personnel, and we may not be able to attract, retain and motivate these individuals. We compete for talent with numerous companies, as well as universities and nonprofit research organizations. Our future success also depends on the personal efforts and abilities of the principal members of our senior management and scientific staff to provide strategic direction, manage our operations and maintain a cohesive and stable environment. We do not maintain key man life insurance on the lives of any of the members of our senior management. The loss of key personnel for any reason or our inability to hire, retain and motivate additional qualified personnel in the future could prevent us from sustaining or growing our business.\nProduct defects could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, unanticipated use of a product or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of the product can lead to injury or other adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to a product (either voluntary or required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. Any recall of our system could result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our system. Personal injuries relating to the use of our system could also result in product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals. As discussed under Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness-Our Strategy\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are currently in the process of reviewing and making further improvements to our C-Pulse System in response to feedback received from patients and physicians. We may be unable to improve the C-Pulse System in ways that improve patient acceptance, including by Class III heart failure patients in particular. We are also working on improving the design of and further developing our fully-implantable system. Any one of these factors related to the current or future design of the C-Pulse System could substantially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be sued for product liability, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices carries a significant risk of product liability claims. Our system treats Class III and ambulatory Class IV heart failure for patients who typically have serious medical issues. As a result, our exposure to product liability claims may be heightened because the people who use our system have a high risk of suffering adverse outcomes, regardless of the safety or efficacy of our system. In addition, because our system has been implanted in a limited number of patients to date, we cannot assure you that we are currently aware of all material risks related to use of our system or that could lead to product liability claims against us.\nWe may be held liable if any product we develop or commercialize causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing, sale or consumer use. The safety studies we must perform and the regulatory approvals required to commercialize our system will not protect us from any such liability. We carry product liability insurance with a $10 million aggregate limit. However, if there are product liability claims against us, our insurance may be insufficient to cover the expense of defending against such claims, or may be insufficient to pay or settle such claims. Furthermore, we may be unable to obtain adequate product liability insurance coverage for commercial sales of any of our approved products. If such insurance is insufficient to protect us, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be harmed. If any product liability claim is made against us, our reputation and future sales will be damaged, even if we have adequate insurance coverage. Even if a product liability claim against us is without merit or if we are not found liable for any damages, a product liability claim could result in decreased interest in our clinical studies, decreased demand for our system, if approved for commercialization, injury to our reputation, diversion of management\u2019s attention from operating our business, withdrawal of clinical study participants, significant costs of related litigation, loss of revenue or the inability to commercialize the C-Pulse System.\nIf we acquire other businesses, products or technologies, we will be subject to risks that could hurt our business.\nWe may pursue acquisitions to obtain complementary businesses, products or technologies. Any such acquisition may not produce the revenues, earnings or business synergies that we anticipate and an acquired business, product or technology might not perform as we expect. Our management could spend a significant amount of time, effort and money in identifying, pursuing and completing the acquisition. If we complete an acquisition, we may encounter significant difficulties and incur substantial expenses in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses, products or technologies into our operations. In particular, we may lose the services of key employees and we may make changes in management that impair the acquired business\u2019s relationships with employees, vendors and customers. Additionally, we may acquire development-stage companies that are not yet profitable and which require continued investment, which could decrease our future earnings or increase our futures losses.\nAny of these outcomes could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of an acquisition. To pay for an acquisition, we might use stock or cash. Alternatively, we might borrow money from a bank or other lender. If we use stock, our stockholders would experience dilution of their ownership interests. If we use cash or debt financing, our financial liquidity would be reduced. As a result of our annual impairment testing, we may be required to capitalize a significant amount of intangibles, including goodwill, which may lead to significant amortization or write-off charges. These amortization charges and write-offs could decrease our future earnings or increase our future losses.\nRisks Relating to Regulation\nWe do not have FDA approval for our system and our success will depend heavily on the success of any future clinical trials for the C-Pulse System. Any failure or significant delay in successfully completing our clinical trials or obtaining regulatory approvals could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects and require us to seek additional funding.\nUpon completion of the six-month follow-up period for our feasibility study, we submitted the study\u2019s clinical data to the FDA in November 2011. In November 2012, the FDA provided us with unconditional approval to initiate a pivotal study. The COUNTER HF study was designed to enroll 388 patients randomized 1:1 to treatment (C-Pulse implantation) versus optimal medical therapy, at up to 40 participating hospitals and clinics. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is defined as freedom from worsening heart failure resulting in hospitalization, LVAD implantation, cardiac transplantation or heart failure related death. We commenced enrollment in the U.S. Counter HF study in September 2013. In February 2015, we announced that we had received unconditional approval from the FDA to conduct an interim analysis of COUNTER HF, which could have reduced the overall duration of the trial. In March 2015, we announced that COUNTER HF had reached a pre-determined pausing point and we temporarily suspended enrollment in accordance with the study protocol. In May 2015, we announced that the FDA had approved the resumption of patient enrollment in the study and we began the process of reactivating clinical sites and of resuming patient enrollment into the study. We concluded 2015 with 66 enrollments, 35 randomizations, 29 activated centers and 9 additional centers committed to participate. As we evaluated the pace of enrollment into our pivotal and post market studies, we determined that enrolling these studies would take much longer than anticipated as a result of the invasiveness of the implant procedure and requirements imposed by the trial design. As a result, on March\n3, 2016 we announced that we are no longer enrolling patients into the COUNTER HF and OPTIONS HF studies and that we plan to pursue a new strategic direction, as discussed under Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness-Our Strategy\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the termination of the studies, our costs associated with our clinical trials will decrease in the short term, but we expect our future operating expenses to increase as we conduct further studies and focus on the development of our fully-implantable system in order to obtain regulatory approvals and commercialize the C-Pulse System, if we are able to do so at all. FDA scrutiny of IDE applications has intensified in recent years, increasing the risk of future delay or failure.\nIn addition to successfully completing studies in the U.S., we will need to receive approval in each country outside the European Union in which we seek to sell our system. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval varies from country to country and approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another. In addition, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. We cannot assure when, or if, we will be able to commence sales in any jurisdiction within or outside the United States.\nIf we are unable to complete necessary studies, or experience significant delays in any future studies, or if the results of our future studies do not meet safety and efficacy endpoints, our ability to obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our system and to generate revenues will be significantly harmed.\nWe will need to obtain FDA approval to commercialize our system in the United States.\nWe will need to obtain FDA approval to commercialize our system in the United States, which will require us to conduct clinical studies in the United States and to complete those studies successfully. If we fail to obtain approval from the FDA, we will not be able to market and sell our system in the United States, which we believe is the largest potential market for the C-Pulse System. We do not currently have the necessary regulatory approvals to commercialize the C-Pulse System in the United States. We can offer no assurance that our clinical studies will be successful or that we will ever obtain FDA approval of the C-Pulse System or any future products.\nIn order to obtain FDA approval for the C-Pulse System, we will be required to receive a PMA from the FDA. A PMA must be supported by data from pre-clinical and clinical studies to demonstrate safety and efficacy. A clinical study will be required to support an application for a PMA, and we received FDA approval of our IDE application in November 2012 that allowed us to commence a clinical study in the United States. Enrollment in our U.S. pivotal study began in September2013. On March 3, 2016, we announced that we are no longer enrolling patients into our U.S. pivotal study. In order to support an application for a PMA, we will need to receive approval from the FDA of a new IDE application in the future for a new pivotal study. There is no guaranty that we will receive approval for such a study or that any such study will meet its objectives or end-points to show the safety and efficacy of our system so as to support an application for a PMA. As discussed under Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness-Our Strategy\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are currently in the process of reviewing and making further improvements to our C-Pulse System in response to feedback received from patients and physicians. We are also working to improve the design of our next-generation, fully-implantable system.\nThe process of obtaining approval for a pivotal study and for a PMA from the FDA for the C-Pulse System, or any future products or enhancements or modifications to the C-Pulse System or any other product we may pursue in the future, will:\n\u00b7 take a significant period of time;\n\u00b7 require the expenditure of substantial resources;\n\u00b7 involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing; and\n\u00b7 require submissions to the FDA, such as IDE or PMA supplements;\nand may:\n\u00b7 require changes to the product; or\n\u00b7 result in failure to support approval of the product or limitations on the indicated uses of the product.\nIncreased attention to safety and oversight issues in light of recent, widely publicized events concerning the safety of certain food, drug and medical device products could cause the FDA to take a more cautious approach in connection with approvals for devices such as ours, which could delay or prevent FDA approval of the C-Pulse System.\nThere can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals from the FDA or, if we do receive the required approvals, that we will receive them on a timely basis. The failure to receive product approval by the FDA would significantly harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOn March 3, 2016, we announced that we are no longer enrolling patients in our U.S. pivotal study. In order to support an application for a PMA, we will need to receive approval from the FDA of a new IDE application in the future for a new pivotal study. We may be unable to complete such a study for the C-Pulse System or other clinical studies, which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of the C-Pulse System and impair our financial position.\nConducting clinical studies is a complex and uncertain process.\nCompletion of enrollment of any future U.S. pivotal study could be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u00b7 receiving approval from the FDA of a new IDE application;\n\u00b7 reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical study sites;\n\u00b7 manufacturing sufficient quantities of the C-Pulse System;\n\u00b7 obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct the study at a prospective site; and\n\u00b7 obtaining sufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the study and the willingness of patients to be enrolled in our study.\nIn addition, the completion of the study and our other ongoing clinical studies could be delayed, suspended or terminated for several reasons, including:\n\u00b7 ongoing discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the scope or design of our pre-clinical results or clinical study or requests for supplemental information with respect to our pre-clinical results or clinical study results;\n\u00b7 our or our clinical sites\u2019 failure or inability to conduct the clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 sites currently participating in the study may drop out of the study, which may require us to engage new sites or petition the FDA for an expansion of the number of sites that are permitted to be involved in the study;\n\u00b7 patients may not achieve the required clinical end-points of the study;\n\u00b7 patients may not wish to enroll, remain in or complete clinical studies at the rates we expect;\n\u00b7 patients may experience serious adverse events or side effects during the study, which, whether or not related to our system, could cause the FDA or other regulatory authorities to place the clinical study on hold; and\n\u00b7 clinical investigators may not perform clinical studies on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical study protocol and good clinical practice requirements.\nIf any future pivotal study is delayed, it will take us longer to ultimately commercialize a product or result in our being unable to do so. Our development costs will also increase if we have material delays in our pivotal study or if we need to perform more or larger clinical studies than planned. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete, or achieve the desired clinical end-points from, a pivotal study at all, which could prevent us from receiving regulatory approval for the C-Pulse System altogether. Any of the foregoing could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects and cause us to seek additional funding.\nIf we are not able to improve the design of the C-Pulse System and design and implement a beneficial revised regulatory pathway, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of our change in strategic focus may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nSpecifically, risks related to our shift in strategic focus include, among other things:\n\u00b7 that the FDA may not approve our requests and applications related to our new clinical strategy;\n\u00b7 that we may be unable to redesign our C-Pulse System in a way that increases patient acceptance;\n\u00b7 that we may be unable to design our next-generation, fully implantable system in a way that causes it to be accepted in the marketplace;\n\u00b7 that we may lose the support of our investigators as a result of the cessation of enrollment in our studies and may not be able to garner that support for our revised clinical and product development strategy; and\n\u00b7 that the use of our CE mark may be limited in the EU if we do not complete a post-market study.\nIn addition, the shifts in our strategic focus may result in additional or unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated cost reduction benefits may not be realized. There is also no guarantee that we will successfully develop and execute a new strategic plan and our financial performance will likely suffer if we are unable to do so.\nIf we fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement for our system by third-party payers, there may be no commercially viable markets for our system or the markets may be much smaller than expected.\nThe availability and levels of reimbursement by governmental and other third-party payers significantly affect the market for our system. Reimbursement by third-party payers in the United States typically is based on the device\u2019s perceived benefit and whether it is deemed medically reasonable and necessary. Reimbursement levels of third-party payers in the United States are also based on established payment formulas that take into account part or all of the cost associated with these devices and the related procedures performed. We cannot assure you the level of reimbursement we might obtain in the United States, if any, for our system. If we do not obtain adequate levels of reimbursement for our system by third-party payers in the United States, which we believe is the largest potential market for our system, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be harmed.\nReimbursement and health care payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country, and include both government-sponsored health care and private insurance. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to produce additional clinical data, which may involve one or more additional clinical studies, that compares the cost-effectiveness of our system to other available therapies. We may not obtain international reimbursement or pricing approvals in a timely manner, if at all. We do not currently plan to commercialize the C-Pulse System in any country unless the product is approved for reimbursement. Our failure to receive international reimbursement or pricing approvals would significantly harm our operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe believe that future reimbursement may be subject to increased restrictions both in the United States and in international markets. Future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payers may adversely affect the demand for the C-Pulse System and limit our ability to sell the C-Pulse System or any future products on a profitable basis. In addition, third-party payers continually attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care by challenging the prices charged for health care products and services. If reimbursement for our system is unavailable in any market or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, market acceptance of our system would be significantly impaired and our future revenues, if any, would be significantly harmed.\nWe depend on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients in our clinical studies, and on other third parties to manage the studies and to perform related data collection and analysis, and, as a result, we may face costs and delays that are outside of our control.\nWe have and plan to continue to rely on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients in our clinical studies and other third parties to manage the related data collection and analysis. While we are obligated by regulation to monitor the sites for compliance, we have limited oversight over the clinical investigators and sites and cannot control the amount and timing of resources that clinical sites may devote to our clinical studies. If these clinical investigators and clinical sites fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical studies, to ensure compliance by patients with clinical protocols or to comply with regulatory requirements, we will be unable to complete these studies, which could prevent us from obtaining regulatory approvals for our system. Our agreements with clinical investigators and clinical study sites for clinical testing place substantial responsibilities on these parties and, if these parties fail to perform as expected, our studies could be delayed or terminated. If sites fail to meet FDA requirements in conducting the studies, we can be held responsible. If these clinical investigators, clinical sites or other third parties do not carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised\ndue to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical studies may be extended, delayed or terminated, or the clinical data may be rejected by the FDA, our costs will increase and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our system.\nOur manufacturers and suppliers might not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to manufacturing and quality processes, which could harm our financial results and prospects.\nEven if our system receives marketing approval, product approvals by the FDA can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards. We rely on third parties to manufacture the C-Pulse System. We are required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the applicable QSR by controlling our suppliers and requiring that they manufacture in conformance with the QSR. A contractor that manufactures a completed device for us is directly subject to the QSR but we also are held responsible by the FDA. A contractor that manufactures a component is not subject to the QSR. In those cases we are responsible to the FDA for requiring by contract that the component meet QSR standards. The QSR is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our system. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. A failure by our manufacturers to comply with the QSR or to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection could cause a significant delay in our ability to have our system manufactured and to complete our clinical studies and could significantly increase our costs, which would harm our financial results and our prospects. In addition, suppliers of components of, and products used to manufacture, our system must also comply with FDA and foreign regulatory requirements, which often require significant time, money and record-keeping and quality assurance efforts and subject us and our suppliers to potential regulatory inspections and stoppages. We are also subject to the international standard ISO 13485 in other jurisdictions. Like the QSR, ISO 13485 holds us responsible under the Purchasing Controls section for obtaining compliance with the standard by all of our suppliers.\nWe plan to operate in multiple regulatory environments that require costly and time consuming approvals.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approvals to commercialize the C-Pulse System or any other product that we may develop in one jurisdiction, sales of our system in other jurisdictions will be subject to regulatory requirements that vary from country to country. The time and cost required to obtain approvals from these countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and may otherwise differ from those of the FDA. Laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our system are subject to future changes, as are administrative interpretations and policies of regulatory agencies. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign, federal, state or local market laws or regulations or administrative interpretations and policies of regulatory agencies, we could be precluded from commercializing our system in those countries and could become subject to enforcement actions. Enforcement actions could include product seizures, recalls, withdrawal of clearances or approvals and civil and criminal penalties, which in each case would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLegislative or regulatory reforms may adversely affect our ability to sell the C-Pulse System profitably.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the clearance or approval, manufacture and marketing of a medical device. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and the C-Pulse System. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. For example, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions that may prevent or delay approval or clearance of the C-Pulse System. For example, in 2011, the FDA announced a Plan of Action to modernize and improve the FDA\u2019s premarket review of medical devices, and has implemented, and continues to implement, reforms intended to streamline the premarket review process. In addition, as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, Congress enacted several reforms entitled the Medical Device Regulatory Improvements and additional miscellaneous provisions which will further affect medical device regulation both pre- and post-approval. Any change in the laws or regulations that govern the approval processes relating to the C-Pulse System could make it more difficult and costly to obtain approval for the C-Pulse System. Other jurisdictions might change approval regulations that could affect marketability of the C-Pulse System. For example, the European Union is modifying the Medical Device Directive and the Active Implantable Directive, which will increase requirements on devices such as the C-Pulse System.\nThe C-Pulse System may never achieve market acceptance even if we obtain regulatory approvals.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approvals to commercialize the C-Pulse System, our next-generation, fully-implantable system or any other product that we may develop, our products may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, third-party health care payers or the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of any of the devices that we may develop will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 the perceived effectiveness and price of the product;\n\u00b7 the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u00b7 the invasiveness of the implant procedure;\n\u00b7 the reliability of the product;\n\u00b7 the impact of the device on the lifestyle of the patient;\n\u00b7 potential advantages over alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the strength of marketing and distribution support; and\n\u00b7 sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement.\nIf the C-Pulse System, our next-generation, fully-implantable system or any other product that we may develop, is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party health care payers and the medical community, we may not generate product revenue and we may not become profitable or be able to sustain profitability.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to U.S. federal and state health care fraud and abuse and false claims laws and regulations. Prosecutions under such laws have increased in recent years and we may become subject to such litigation. If we are unable to comply or have not fully complied with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nIf we are successful in achieving regulatory approval to market the C-Pulse System, our operations will be directly, or indirectly through our customers and health care professionals, subject to various U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, federal False Claims Act, and the FCPA. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, and marketing and education programs.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid. Several courts have interpreted the statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal health care covered business, the statute has been violated. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and, despite a series of narrow safe harbors, prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry. Penalties for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil and administrative sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. An alleged violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may be used as a predicate offense to establish liability pursuant to other federal laws and regulations such as the federal False Claims Act. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for health care items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing, or causing to be filed, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201crelators\u201d or \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The frequency of filing qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of medical device, pharmaceutical and health care companies to have to defend False Claim Act actions. The Affordable Care Act includes provisions expanding the ability of certain relators to bring actions that would have been previously dismissed under prior law. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 encouraged states to enact or modify their state false claims act to be at least as effective as the federal False Claims Act by granting states a portion of any federal Medicaid funds recovered through Medicaid-related actions. Most states have enacted state false claims laws, and many of those states included laws with qui tam provisions. States had until March 31, 2013 to enact or amend their false claims laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act for review and approval to receive a greater portion of any recovery.\nThe Affordable Care Act includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs, biologics, devices and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid starting in 2012 to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals beginning in August2013 and to report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services starting in 2014 for subsequent public disclosure. Manufacturers must also disclose investment interests held by physicians and their family members. Failure to submit the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to $1 million per year for knowing violations and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the United States, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. In addition, some states such as Massachusetts and Vermont impose an outright ban on certain gifts to physicians. If we receive FDA clearance to market our system in the United States, these laws could affect our promotional activities by limiting the kinds of interactions we could have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers or users of our system. Both the disclosure laws and gift bans will impose administrative, cost and compliance burdens on us.\nWe are unable to predict whether we could be subject to actions under any of these laws, or the impact of such actions. If we are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above and other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, or an administrative action of suspension or exclusion from government health care reimbursement programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to the FCPA and other countries\u2019 anti-corruption/anti-bribery regimes, such as the U.K. Bribery Act. The FCPA prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Safeguards we implement to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, any of which would likely harm our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe expanded regulations under the HITECH Act have increased the possibility that device manufactures might be considered business associates in the future, exposing us to penalties for potential breaches of HIPAA Security Regulation.\nRisks Relating to our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights effectively, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection in the United States and other countries of the intellectual property relating to or incorporated into our technology and system. As of December 31, 2015, we owned over 75 issued patents in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. We estimate that most of our currently issued U.S. patents will expire between approximately 2020 and 2024. Our pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will provide us any competitive advantage. Even if issued, existing or future patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length of terms of patent protection we may have for our system. Changes in patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries could also diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. In addition, the legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. In order to preserve and enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights, we may need to make claims or file lawsuits against third parties. This can entail significant costs to us and divert our management\u2019s attention from developing and commercializing our system.\nIntellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to us.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation involving medical device patents and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies used in our business. Any claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or require us to pay substantial damages. If we are unsuccessful in defending ourselves against these types of claims, we may be required to do one or more of the following:\n\u00b7 stop clinical studies or delay or abandon commercialization of our system;\n\u00b7 attempt to obtain a license to sell or use the relevant technology or substitute technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; or\n\u00b7 redesign our system.\nIn the event a claim against us were successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our system to avoid infringement, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be significantly harmed.\nIf we were unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and system could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, processes and know-how. We generally seek to protect this information by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and third parties. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nOur system could infringe patent rights of others, which may require costly litigation and, if we are not successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages or limit our ability to commercialize our system.\nOur commercial success depends on our ability to develop, manufacture and market our system and technology without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. As our industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that there may be patents issued to third parties that relate to our system and technologies of which we are not aware or that we must challenge to continue our operations as currently contemplated. Our system may infringe or may be alleged to infringe these patents.\nIn addition, some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our issued patents or our pending applications or that we were the first to invent the technology. Another party may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering our system or technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications or patents, which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful if the other party had independently arrived at the same or similar invention prior to our own invention, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in our industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other medical device companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees, or we, have used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected health information, personally identifiable information, intellectual property and proprietary business information owned or controlled by ourselves or others. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing on-site systems. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business-critical information including research and development information, commercial information, and business and financial information. We face four primary risks relative to protecting this critical information, including: loss of access risk; inappropriate disclosure risk; inappropriate modification risk; and the risk of our being unable to adequately monitor our controls over the first three risks.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance, and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or\nother disruptions. Any such breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as HIPAA, and regulatory penalties. Although we believe we have implemented adequate security measures, there is no guarantee we can continue to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access, loss or dissemination that could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to conduct our analyses, bill payers or patients, conduct research and development activities, collect, process, and prepare company financial information, provide information about our products and other patient and physician education and outreach efforts through our website, manage the administrative aspects of our business, and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health-related, and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory, and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, these privacy regulations may differ from country to country, and may vary based on whether testing is performed in the United States or in the local country. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nAn active trading market for our shares of common stock in the United States may not develop.\nOur common stock has been listed for trading on NASDAQ only since February 16, 2012 and has experienced limited trading volume. The average daily trading volume in our common stock on NASDAQ for the three-month period ended December 31, 2015 was approximately 102,000 shares. There can be no assurance that an active public market for our shares will continue to develop in the United States. If an active trading market does not continue to develop in the United States, the market price and liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock has traded on NASDAQ since February 16, 2012, and CDIs representing beneficial ownership of our common stock traded on the ASX from September 2004 until May 6, 2013. The price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile, which means that it could decline substantially within a short period of time. For example, the price per share of our common stock traded on NASDAQ ranged from $4.85 to $8.13 from January 1, 2013 to June 30, 2013, and from $5.34 to $13.80 from July 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013, from $4.99 to $11.29 from January 1, 2014 to June 30, 2014, from $3.56 to $6.40 from July 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, from $3.22 to $6.90 from January 1, 2015 to June 30, 2015 and from $1.06 to $3.57 from July 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015. The price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including the following:\n\u00b7 future announcements concerning us or our competitors, including announcements of the details and expected timing of our revised clinical and product strategy;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments, disclosure regarding completed, ongoing or future clinical studies and enforcement actions bearing on advertising, marketing or sales;\n\u00b7 reports and recommendations of analysts and whether or not we meet the milestones and metrics set forth in such reports;\n\u00b7 introduction of new products;\n\u00b7 acquisition or loss of significant manufacturers, distributors or suppliers or an inability to obtain sufficient quantities of materials needed to manufacture our system;\n\u00b7 quarterly variations in operating results, which we have experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future;\n\u00b7 business acquisitions or divestitures;\n\u00b7 changes in governmental or third-party reimbursement practices;\n\u00b7 fluctuations of investor interest in the medical device sector; and\n\u00b7 fluctuations in the economy, world political events or general market conditions.\nIn addition, stock markets in general, and the market for shares of health care stocks in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years, fluctuations that frequently have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline below its current price and the market price of our shares may fluctuate significantly in the future. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance.\nIf the trading price of our common stock fails to comply with the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ, we could face possible delisting. NASDAQ delisting could materially adversely affect the market for our shares.\nBeginning on February 10, 2016, our common stock has generally traded on NASDAQ at less than $1.00 per share. If our common stock remains below the minimum bid price of $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, NASDAQ will send us a deficiency notice, advising that we have been afforded a \u201ccompliance period\u201d of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the applicable requirements. If we are unable to resolve our bid price deficiency during the applicable compliance period, NASDAQ Staff will issue a delisting letter. At that time, we may request a hearing before a Hearing Panel, which may stay the delisting.\nWe cannot assure you that the price of our common stock will comply with the requirements for continued listing of our shares on NASDAQ. If we receive a deficiency notice, we cannot assure that we will be able to regain compliance or that any appeal of a decision to delist our common stock would be successful. If our common stock loses its listed status on NASDAQ and we are not successful in obtaining a listing on another exchange, our common stock would likely trade only in the over-the-counter market. If our common stock were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling our common stock could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts\u2019 coverage of us may be reduced. In addition, in the event our common stock is delisted, broker-dealers have certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock, further limiting the liquidity thereof. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock.\nOur ability to use U.S. net operating loss carryforwards or Australian tax losses might be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had U.S. net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $94.0 million for U.S. income tax purposes, which expire from 2024 through 2034. To the extent these NOL carryforwards are available, we intend to use them to reduce any corporate income tax liability associated with our operations that we might have in the future. Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cInternal Revenue Code\u201d), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOL carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership. As a result, prior or future changes in ownership could put limitations on the availability of our NOL carryforwards. In addition, our ability to utilize the current NOL carryforwards might be further limited by future issuances of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had tax losses in the Commonwealth of Australia of approximately AU$49.1 million. Continuing utilization of carryforward tax losses in Australia may also be affected by the issuance of our common stock in the future. This is because one test for carrying forward tax losses in Australia from year to year requires continuity of ultimate ownership (subject to the relevant tests in Australian tax law) of more than 50% between the loss year and the income year in which the loss is claimed.\nTo the extent use of our NOL carryforwards or tax losses is limited, our income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use NOL carryforwards and tax losses, which could result in lower profits.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our products and business. Accordingly, our stockholders will not realize a return on their investments unless the trading price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe will continue to incur increased costs as a result of being a U.S. reporting company.\nIn connection with the effectiveness of our registration statement on Form 10, as of February 14, 2012, we became subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Although we were previously listed on the ASX and had been required to file financial information and make certain other filings with the ASX, our status as a U.S. reporting company under the Exchange Act has caused us, and will continue to cause us, to incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not previously incur,\nincluding costs related to compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the listing requirements of NASDAQ. We expect these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly, and these activities may increase general and administrative expenses and divert management\u2019s time and attention away from revenue-generating activities. We also expect these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\nInvestors could lose confidence in our financial reports, and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected, if our internal controls over financial reporting are found not to be effective by management or by an independent registered public accounting firm or if we make disclosure of existing or potential material weaknesses in those controls.\nIn connection with becoming a company required to file reports with the SEC, we are required to comply with the internal control evaluation and certification requirements of Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 until the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act or a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined by applicable SEC rules.\nWe continue to evaluate our existing internal controls over financial reporting against the standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. During the course of our ongoing evaluation of the internal controls, we may identify areas requiring improvement, and may have to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review. Remediating any deficiencies, significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that we or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify may require us to incur significant costs and expend significant time and management resources. We cannot assure you that any of the measures we implement to remedy any such deficiencies will effectively mitigate or remedy such deficiencies. The existence of one or more material weaknesses could affect the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting. Investors could lose confidence in our financial reports, and the value of our common stock may be harmed, if our internal controls over financial reporting are found not to be effective by management or by an independent registered public accounting firm or if we make disclosure of existing or potential material weaknesses in those controls.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), or (iv) any other action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions described above. This forum selection provision may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and stockholder rights plan, as well as certain provisions of the DGCL, may delay or deter a change in control transaction.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of deterring takeovers, such as those provisions authorizing our board of directors to issue, from time to time, any series of preferred stock and fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of such series of preferred stock; prohibiting stockholders from acting by written consent in lieu of a meeting; requiring advance notice of stockholder intention to put forth director nominees or bring up other business at a stockholders\u2019 meeting; prohibiting stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders; requiring a 66 2/3% majority stockholder approval in order for stockholders to amend certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or adopt new bylaws; providing that, subject to the rights of preferred shares, the directors will be divided into three classes and the number of directors is to be fixed exclusively by our board of directors; and providing that none of our directors may be removed without cause. Section203 of the DGCL, from which we did not elect to opt out, provides that if a holder acquires 15% or more of our stock without prior approval of our board of directors, that holder will be subject to certain restrictions on its ability to acquire us within three years. These provisions may delay or deter a change in control of us, and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nFurther, on June 14, 2013, our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan, which is designed to assure that all of our stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the Company and to guard against partial tender offers, open market accumulations and other abusive or coercive tactics without paying stockholders a control premium. The stockholder rights plan may have anti-takeover effects by discouraging potential proxy contests and other takeover attempts, particularly those that have not been negotiated with the board of directors, and the stockholder rights plan may also inhibit the acquisition of a controlling position in our common stock. Therefore, transactions may not occur that stockholders would otherwise support and/or from which they would receive a substantial premium for their shares over the current market price. The stockholder rights plan may also make it more difficult to remove members of the current board of directors or management.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under federal securities laws and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the external auditor attestation requirements of Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. The JOBS Act also permits emerging growth companies to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to U.S. public companies. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following our initial public offering, although we could lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may decline or be more volatile.\nAs explained above, Section 102(b)(1)of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section7(a)(2)(B)of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company can delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period, and as a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for new or revised accounting standards for U.S. public companies.\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 18.3 million shares of common stock outstanding. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, for example, liquidation of shares held by our principal stockholders, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, the market price of our common stock could decline. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nWe have a large number of authorized but unissued shares of stock, which could negatively impact a potential investor if they purchased our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides for 100,000,000 shares of authorized common stock, of which more than 80,000,000 shares are available for future issuance, and 40,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock, 30,000 shares of which are designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in connection with the stockholder rights plan and all of which are available for future issuance. We expect to seek additional financing during the second half of 2016. The issuance of additional shares of common stock may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and relative voting power and may cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. We could use the shares of common stock that are available for future issuance in dilutive equity financing transactions, or to oppose a hostile takeover attempt or delay or prevent changes in control or changes in or removal of management, including transactions that are favored by a majority of the stockholders or in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices or benefit in some other manner.\nOur board of directors will be authorized, without further stockholder approval, to issue up to 39,970,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights, preferences and privileges as our board may determine. These rights, preferences and privileges may include dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights and liquidation rights that may be greater than the rights of our common stock. As a\nresult, the rights of holders of our common stock will be subject to, and could be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.\nOn June 14, 2013, our board of directors authorized 30,000 shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in connection with the Company\u2019s adoption of the stockholder rights plan.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our common stock or if analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.", "PERMNO": 13279, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "CHFS"}
