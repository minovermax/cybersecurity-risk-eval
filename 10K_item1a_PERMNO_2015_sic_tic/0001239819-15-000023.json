{"cik": "1239819", "company": "LUNA INNOVATIONS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. ITEM 1A.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations and financial results. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission also contain forward-looking statements that involve risks or uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or contemplated by these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risks we face described below, as well as other variables that could affect our operating results. Past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS GENERALLY\nOur technology is subject to a license from Intuitive, which is revocable in certain circumstances. Without this license, we cannot continue to market, manufacture or sell our fiber-optic products.\nAs a part of the sale of our assets to Intuitive, we entered into a license agreement with Intuitive pursuant to which we received rights to use all of our transferred technology outside the field of medicine and in respect of our existing non-shape sensing products in certain non-robotic medical fields. This license back to us is revocable if after notice and certain time periods, we were to (i) challenge the validity or enforceability of the transferred patents and patent applications, (ii) commercialize our fiber optical shape sensing and localization technology in the field of medicine (except to perform on a development and supply project for Hansen), (iii) violate our obligations related to our ability to sublicense in the field of medicine or (iv) violate our confidentiality obligations in a manner that advantages a competitor in the field of medicine and not cure such violation. Maintaining this license is necessary for us to conduct our fiber-optic products business, both for our telecom products and our ODiSI sensing products. If this license were to be revoked by Intuitive, we would no longer be able to market, manufacture or sell these products which would severely limit our ability to continue operations.\nIf there are substantial sales of our common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, our stock price could decline.\nIf any of our stockholders were to sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock may decline, which might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. Substantial sales of our common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, may have a material adverse effect on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nPursuant to an Investor Rights Agreement, we filed a Form S-3 registration statement in 2014 registering the potential resale of an aggregate of up to approximately 6.3 million shares of our common stock by our then two largest stockholders, Carilion Clinic, or Carilion and Dr. Kent Murphy. This registration statement has been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Dr. Murphy has sold substantially all of his approximately 2.8 million shares included in the registration statement. Carilion continues to hold its approximately 3.5 million shares covered by the registration statement (including approximately 1.3 million shares issuable to Carilion upon conversion of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock that Carilion holds). Because the registration statement is effective, these shares may be sold freely in the public market. Any sales of these shares, or the perception that future sales of shares may occur by Carilion or any of our other significant stockholders, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our stock. Any such continuing material adverse effect on the market price of our stock could impair our ability to comply with NASDAQ\u2019s continuing listing standards in respect of our minimum stock price, as further described below.\nOur narrowed scope and focus may make it more difficult for us to achieve or maintain operating profitability.\nThrough the recent sales of SCC to Mac-B and of our medical shape sensing business to Intuitive, we have reduced our overall size and narrowed our focus to one key growth objective: to become the leading provider of fiber optic strain & temperature sensing solutions and standard test methods for composite, as well as non-composite, materials, structures and systems. There can be no guarantee that we will be successful in pursuing this objective. Although we anticipate realizing cost savings as a result of the sale of assets to Mac-B and Intuitive, we will continue to incur significant operating expenses associated with our public company infrastructure. Accordingly, we will need to significantly increase the revenues we generate from our remaining operations in order to achieve or maintain operating profitability, and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to do so.\nWe depend on third-party vendors for specialized components in our manufacturing operations, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations that could harm our business.\nWe primarily rely on third-party vendors for the manufacture of the specialized components used in our products. The highly specialized nature of our supply requirements poses risks that we may not be able to locate additional sources of the specialized components required in our business. For example, there are few manufacturers who produce the special lasers used in our optical test equipment. Our reliance on these vendors subjects us to a number of risks that could negatively affect our ability to manufacture our products and harm our business, including interruption of supply. Although we are now manufacturing tunable lasers in low-rate initial production, we expect our overall reliance on third-party vendors to continue. Any significant delay or interruption in the supply of components, or our inability to obtain substitute components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices and in a timely manner could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and could harm our business.\nAs a provider of contract research to the U.S. government, we are subject to federal rules, regulations, audits and investigations, the violation or failure of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our government customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of a specific law or regulation could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts. In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at their convenience, as well as for default based on performance.\nIn addition, U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Department of Labor, routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The U.S. government also may review the adequacy of, and a contractor\u2019s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor\u2019s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, while such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. If an audit uncovers the inclusion of certain claimed costs deemed to be expressly unallowable, as with the preliminary audit report we received in September 2014 from the Defense Contract Audit Agency, or improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. In addition, our reputation could suffer serious harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us.\nIn addition to the risk of government audits and investigations, U.S. government contracts and grants impose requirements on contractors and grantees relating to ethics and business practices, which carry civil and criminal penalties including monetary fines, assessments, loss of the ability to do business with the U.S. government and certain other criminal penalties.\nWe may also be prohibited from commercially selling certain products that we develop under our Technology Development segment or related products based on the same core technologies if the U.S. government determines that the commercial availability of those products could pose a risk to national security. For example, certain of our wireless technologies have been classified as secret by the U.S. government and as a result we cannot sell them commercially. Any of these determinations would limit our ability to generate product sales and license revenues.\nOur failure to attract, train and retain skilled employees or members of our senior management and to obtain necessary security clearances for such persons or maintain a facility security clearance would adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe availability of highly trained and skilled technical and professional personnel is critical to our future growth and profitability. Competition for scientists, engineers, technicians and professional personnel is intense and our competitors aggressively recruit key employees. In the past, we have experienced difficulties in recruiting and hiring these personnel as a result of the tight labor market in certain fields. Any difficulty in hiring or retaining qualified employees, combined with our growth strategy and future needs for additional experienced personnel, particularly in highly specialized areas such as nanomaterial manufacturing and fiber optic sensing technologies, may make it more difficult to meet all of our needs for these employees in a timely manner. Although we intend to continue to devote significant resources to recruit, train and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to attract and retain these employees, especially in technical fields in which the supply of experienced qualified candidates is limited, or at the senior management level. Any failure to do so would have an adverse effect on our business. Any loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet key operational objectives, such as timely and effective project milestones and product introductions, which in turn could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe provide certain services to the U.S. government that require us to maintain a facility security clearance and for certain of our employees and our board chairman to hold security clearances. In general, the failure for necessary persons to obtain or retain sufficient security clearances, any loss by us of a facility security clearance or any public reprimand related to security matters could result in a U.S. government customer terminating an existing contract or choosing not to renew a contract or prevent us from bidding on or winning certain new government contracts.\nIn addition, our future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. We do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies on our officers. The loss of any members of our management team or other key personnel could seriously harm our business.\nWe rely and will continue to rely on contracts and grants awarded under the SBIR program for a significant portion of our revenues. A finding by the SBA that we no longer qualify to receive SBIR awards could adversely affect our business.\nWe compete as a small business for some of our government contracts. Our revenues derived from the Small Business Innovation Research, (\"SBIR\"), program account for a significant portion of our consolidated total revenues, and contract research, including SBIR contracts, will remain a significant portion of our consolidated total revenues for the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2013, approximately 54% of our total revenues were generated under the SBIR program, compared to 47% in 2014.\nWe may not continue to qualify to participate in the SBIR program or to receive new SBIR awards from federal agencies. In order to qualify for SBIR contracts and grants, we must meet certain size and ownership eligibility criteria. These eligibility criteria are applied as of the time of the award of a contract or grant. A company can be declared ineligible for a contract award as a result of a size challenge filed with the SBA by a competitor or a federal agency.\nIn order to be eligible for SBIR contracts and grants, under current SBA rules we must be more than 50% owned and controlled by individuals who are U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens, and/or other small business concerns (each of which is more than 50% owned and controlled by individuals who are U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens) or certain qualified investment companies. In the event our institutional ownership significantly increases, either because of increased buying by institutions or selling by individuals, we could lose eligibility for new SBIR contracts and grants.\nAlso, in order to be eligible for SBIR contracts and grants, the number of our employees, including those of any entities that are considered to be affiliated with us, cannot exceed 500. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately 100 full-time employees. In determining whether we are affiliated with any other entity, the SBA may analyze whether another entity controls or has the power to control us. Carilion is our largest institutional stockholder. Since early 2011, a formal size determination by the SBA that focused on whether or not Carilion is or was our affiliate has been outstanding. Although we do not believe that Carilion has or had the power to control our company, we cannot assure you that the SBA will interpret its regulations in our favor on this question. If the SBA were to make a determination that we are or were affiliated with Carilion, we would exceed the size limitations, as Carilion has over 500 employees. In that case, we would lose eligibility for new SBIR contracts and grants and other awards that are set aside for small businesses based on the criterion of number of employees, and the relevant government agency would have the discretion to suspend performance on existing SBIR grants. The loss of our eligibility to receive SBIR awards would have a material adverse impact on our revenues, cash flows and our ability to fund our growth.\nMoreover, as our business grows, it is foreseeable that we will eventually exceed the SBIR size limitations, in which case we may be required to seek alternative sources of revenues or capital.\nA decline in government research contract awards or government funding for existing or future government research contracts, including SBIR contracts, could adversely affect our revenues, cash flows and ability to fund our growth.\nTechnology development revenues, which consist primarily of government-funded research, accounted for approximately 62% and 57% of our consolidated total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively. As a result, we are vulnerable to adverse changes in our revenues and cash flows if a significant number of our research contracts and subcontracts were to be simultaneously delayed or canceled for budgetary, performance or other reasons. For example, the U.S. government may cancel these contracts at any time without cause and without penalty or may change its requirements, programs or contract budget, any of which could reduce our revenues and cash flows from U.S. government research contracts. Our revenues and cash flows from U.S. government research contracts and subcontracts could also be reduced by declines or other changes in U.S. defense, homeland security and other federal agency budgets. In addition, we compete as a small business for some of these contracts, and in order to maintain our eligibility to compete as a small business, we, together with any affiliates, must continue to meet size and revenue limitations established by the U.S. government.\nOur contract research customer base includes government agencies, corporations and academic institutions. Our customers are not obligated to extend their agreements with us and may elect not to do so. Also, our customers\u2019 priorities regarding funding for certain projects may change and funding resources may no longer be available at previous levels.\nIn addition, the Budget Control Act commits the U.S. Government to reduce the federal deficit by $1.2 trillion over ten years through a combination of automatic, across-the-board spending cuts and caps on discretionary spending. This \u201csequestration\u201d under the Budget Control Act, which is split equally between defense and non-defense programs, went into effect on March 1, 2013. The appropriate resolution reflecting a budget deal for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 reduces but does not eliminate these sequestration cuts. Any spending cuts required by \u201csequestration\u201d could have a material adverse effect on our technology development revenues and, consequently, our results of operations. While the exact manner in which this \u201csequestration\u201d may impact our business remains unclear, funding for programs in which we participate could be reduced, delayed or canceled. Our ability to obtain new contract awards also could be negatively affected.\nIn addition to contract cancellations and changes in agency budgets, our future financial results may be adversely affected by curtailment of or restrictions on the U.S. government\u2019s use of contract research providers, including curtailment due to government budget reductions and related fiscal matters or any legislation or resolution limiting the number or amount of awards we may receive. These or other factors could cause U.S. defense and other federal agencies to conduct research internally rather than through commercial research organizations or direct awards to other organizations, to reduce their overall contract research requirements or to exercise their rights to terminate contracts. Alternatively, the U.S. government may discontinue the SBIR program or its funding altogether. Also, SBIR regulations permit increased competition for SBIR awards from companies that may not have previously been eligible, such as those backed by venture capital operating companies, hedge funds and private equity firms. Any of these developments could limit our ability to obtain new contract awards and adversely affect our revenues, cash flows and ability to fund our growth.\nThe results of our operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers\u2019 businesses and levels of business activity.\nGlobal economic and political conditions affect our customers\u2019 businesses and the markets they serve. A severe or prolonged economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could adversely affect our customers\u2019 financial conditions and the timing or levels of business activity of our customers and the industries we serve. This may reduce the demand for our products or depress pricing for our products and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to products or services for which we do not have competitive advantages, and this could negatively affect the amount of business we are able to obtain. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected as a result.\nThere was a rapid softening of the economy and tightening of the financial markets in 2008 and 2009. This slowing of the economy has reduced the financial capacity of some of our customers and, to the extent that such economic conditions continue in certain industries, it could continue to affect our potential customers, thereby slowing spending on the products and services\nwe provide. The outlook for the economy in 2015 and beyond remains uncertain, and until there is a sustained economic recovery our revenues and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe have a history of losses, and because our strategy for expansion may be costly to implement, we may experience continuing losses and may never achieve or maintain profitability or positive cash flow.\nWe realized a net loss from continuing operations of $5.5 million and $3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses as we pursue our strategic initiatives, including increased expenses for research and development, sales and marketing and manufacturing. We may also grow our business in part through acquisitions of additional companies and complementary technologies which could cause us to incur greater than anticipated transaction expenses, amortization or write-offs of intangible assets and other acquisition-related expenses. As a result, we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future, and these losses could be substantial. At a certain level, continued net losses could impair our ability to comply with NASDAQ continued listing standards, as described further below.\nOur ability to generate additional revenues and to become profitable will depend on our ability to execute our key growth initiative regarding the development, marketing and sale of sensing products, develop and commercialize innovative technologies, expand our contract research capabilities and sell the products that result from those development initiatives. We are unable to predict when or if we will be able to achieve profitability. If our revenues do not increase, or if our expenses increase at a greater rate than our revenues, we will continue to experience losses. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase our profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nWe have obtained capital by borrowing money under a term loan and we might require additional capital to support and expand our business; our term loan has various loan covenants with which we must comply.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth, including developing new products, enhancing our existing products, obtaining important regulatory approvals, enhancing our operating infrastructure, completing our development activities and building our commercial scale manufacturing facilities. To the extent that we are unable to become or remain profitable and to finance our activities from our continuing operations, we may require additional funds to support these initiatives and to grow our business.\nIf we are successful in raising additional funds through issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, including as the result of the issuance of warrants in connection with the financing, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of our existing common stock. Furthermore, such financings may jeopardize our ability to apply for SBIR grants or qualify for SBIR contracts or grants, and our dependence on SBIR grants may restrict our ability to raise additional outside capital. If we raise additional funds through debt financings, these financings may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate our business and make distributions to our stockholders.\nWe have a term loan with SVB, which requires us to observe certain financial and operational covenants, including maintenance of a specified cash balance, protection and registration of intellectual property rights, and certain customary negative covenants, as well as other customary events of default. If any event of default occurs SVB may declare due immediately all borrowings under our term loan and foreclose on the collateral. Furthermore, an event of default would result in an increase in the interest rate on any amounts outstanding.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER\nThe issuance of shares of our common stock to API stockholders in the Merger will substantially reduce the percentage interests of our stockholders.\nIf the Merger is completed, we expect that (i) approximately 11,880,560 shares of our common stock would be issued to existing API common stockholders (including holders of shares subject to a repurchase option or obligation, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with API) and (ii) upon exercise\nor settlement of assumed options and warrants, up to approximately 1,081,042 shares will be issued to holders of assumed options and warrants.\nOur existing common stockholders on the one hand, and former API common stockholders on the other hand, are expected to own approximately 56% and 44%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of our common stock following the completion of the Merger based on the number of each company\u2019s outstanding common shares as of January 30, 2015. Upon attributing ownership to the former API stockholders of the shares of common stock that may be issued upon exercise of the options or warrants to purchase our common stock issued as a result of the Merger, and attributing ownership of the shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding Luna options and restricted stock units (but excluding, for this purpose, the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of our outstanding Series A convertible preferred stock and upon payment of accrued dividends thereon), our existing securityholders would own approximately 57% of our common stock on a fully diluted basis and the former API securityholders would own approximately 43% of our common stock on a fully diluted basis. The issuance of shares of our common stock to API stockholders in the Merger and the assumption by us of API options and warrants will cause a significant reduction in the relative percentage interest of our current securityholders in earnings, voting, liquidation value and book and market value.\nCertain directors and executive officers of Luna and API have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders and API stockholders.\nExecutive officers of Luna and API negotiated the terms of the Merger Agreement under the direction of their respective boards of directors. Our board of directors approved the Merger Agreement and unanimously recommended that our stockholders vote in favor of the issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with the Merger, and the board of API unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and unanimously recommended that API stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated thereby. These directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, or may be deemed to conflict with, yours. These interests include the continued employment of certain of our executive officers, the continued positions of certain directors of Luna and API as directors of the combined company and the indemnification of former directors and officers by the combined company. Certain of API\u2019s executive officers will not be continuing employment with the combined company and, as a result, will be entitled to severance payments under the employment agreements with API. Additionally, our executive officers will be entitled to receive certain bonuses as a result of the completion of the Merger under the terms of the 2014 senior management incentive plan. Our stockholders should be aware of these interests when they consider our board of directors\u2019 recommendation that our stockholders vote in favor of the proposal to issue shares of our common stock in the Merger.\nProvisions of the Merger Agreement may deter alternative business combinations and could negatively impact the stock prices of Luna if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances.\nIn connection with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement we agreed to refrain from soliciting, initiating, or knowingly encouraging or facilitating certain acquisition proposals with any third party, subject to exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement also provides for the payment by us of a nonrefundable reimbursement fee of up to $250,000 or termination fee of $750,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement. These provisions limit our ability to pursue offers from third parties that could result in greater value to our stockholders. The obligation to pay the termination fee or reimbursement fee also may discourage a third party from pursuing an acquisition proposal. If the Merger is terminated and we determine to seek another business combination, we cannot assure our stockholders that we will be able to negotiate a transaction with another company on terms comparable to the terms of the Merger, or that we will avoid incurrence of any fees associated with the termination of the Merger Agreement.\nIn the event we terminate the Merger in circumstances that obligate us to pay the termination fee or reimbursement fee to API, our stock price may decline.\nIf the proposed Merger is not completed, we will have incurred substantial costs that may adversely affect our financial results and operations and the market price of our common stock.\nIf the Merger is not completed, the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. In addition, we have incurred and will incur substantial costs in connection with the proposed Merger. These costs are primarily associated with the fees of attorneys, accountants and our financial advisors. In addition, we diverted significant management resources in an effort to complete the Merger and are subject to restrictions contained in the Merger Agreement on the conduct of our business during the pendency of the Merger. If the Merger is not completed, we will have received little or no benefit in respect of such costs incurred. Also,\nif the Merger is not completed under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay a termination fee to API of $750,000 or a reimbursement fee to API of up to $250,000.\nFurther, if the Merger is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and our suppliers, customers and employees. Each of these factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our financial results and operations.\nIf we cannot successfully transition our revenue mix from contract research revenues to product sales and license revenues, we may not be able to fully execute our business model or grow our business.\nOur business model and future growth depend on our ability to transition to a revenue mix that contains significantly larger product sales and revenues from the provision of services or from licensing. Product sales and these revenues potentially offer greater scalability than contract research revenues. Our current plan is to increase our sales of commercial products, our licensing revenues and our provision of non-research services to customers so as to represent a larger percentage of our total revenues. If we are unable to develop and grow our product sales and revenues from the provision of services or from licensing to augment our contract research revenues, however, our ability to execute our business model or grow our business could suffer. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve increased revenues in this manner.\nWe and API are, and may in the future may become, involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management's attention and harm our business and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all costs and damages.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation often follows certain significant business transactions, such as the sale of a business division or a merger. After our announcement of the Merger, three separate putative class action complaints were filed in Michigan and Delaware, alleging claims of breach of fiduciary duty against the API board of directors and naming Luna as a defendant for aiding and abetting the alleged breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiffs seek injunctive relief and unspecified damages. Responding to this litigation could divert management's attention and harm our business. Moreover, insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all costs and damages we incur in connection with the litigation. It is also possible that we could be subject to additional litigation in connection with the Merger.\nThe failure to integrate successfully the businesses of Luna and API in the expected timeframe would adversely affect the combined company\u2019s future results and the market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock following the completion of the Merger.\nThe success of the Merger will depend, in large part, on sales of the combined company\u2019s products and on the ability of the combined company following the completion of the Merger to realize the anticipated benefits, including annual net operating synergies and cost reductions from combining the businesses of Luna and API. To realize these anticipated benefits, the combined company must successfully integrate Luna\u2019s and API\u2019s respective businesses. This integration will be complex and time-consuming.\nThe failure to successfully integrate and manage the challenges presented by the integration process may result in the combined company\u2019s failure to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022lost sales and customers as a result of customers of either of the two companies deciding not to do business with the combined company;\n\u2022complexities associated with managing the larger combined company with distant business locations;\n\u2022integrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality products;\n\u2022the loss of key employees;\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the Merger; and\n\u2022performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by completing the Merger and integrating the companies\u2019 operations.\nIf any of these events were to occur, the ability of the combined company to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and employees or the combined company\u2019s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger could be adversely affected, or could reduce the combined company\u2019s earnings or otherwise adversely affect its business and financial results after the Merger and, as a result, adversely affect the market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock.\nThe market price for shares of the combined company\u2019s common stock may be affected by factors different from those affecting the market price for shares of Luna common stock prior to the Merger.\nThe risks associated with the combined company may affect the results of operations of the combined company differently than they could affect the results of operations of each of Luna as a separate companies. Additionally, the results of operations of the combined company may be affected by additional or different factors than those that currently affect the results of operations of Luna, including, but not limited to: complexities associated with managing the larger, more complex, combined business; integrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing products and services; and potential performance shortfalls resulting from the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by integrating the companies\u2019 operations.\nFailure to develop, introduce and sell new products or failure to develop and implement new technologies, could adversely impact the financial results of the combined company.\nSuccess of the combined company will depend on its ability to develop and introduce new products and software platforms that customers choose to buy. The new products the market requires tend to be increasingly complex, incorporating more functions and operating at faster speeds than old products. If the combined company fails to introduce new product designs or technologies in a timely manner or if customers do not successfully introduce new systems or products incorporating products of the combined company, the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company could be materially harmed.\nThe Merger will result in changes to the Luna board of directors that may affect the combined company\u2019s operations.\nIf the parties complete the Merger, the composition of the Luna board of directors will change in accordance with the Merger Agreement. This new composition of the board of directors may affect the business strategy and operating decisions of the combined company upon completion of the Merger.\nIf API stockholders sell the shares of Luna common stock received in the Merger, they could cause a decline in the market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock.\nOur issuance of common stock in the Merger will be registered with the SEC. As a result, those shares will be immediately available for resale in the public market following the completion of the Merger. As of January 30, 2015, if the Merger occurred on such date, the number of shares of Luna common stock to be issued to existing API common stockholders, collectively, in connection with the Merger and immediately available for resale would have equaled approximately 44% of the number of outstanding shares of Luna common stock as of such date prior to giving effect to such issuance. API stockholders may sell the stock they receive commencing immediately after the Merger. If this occurs, or if there is a perception in the market that such sales may occur, the market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock may decline.\nCustomer uncertainties related to the Merger could adversely affect the businesses, revenues and gross margins of Luna, API or the combined company.\nIn response to the announcement of the Merger or due to ongoing uncertainty about the Merger, customers of Luna or API may delay or defer purchasing decisions or elect to switch to other suppliers. In particular, prospective customers could be reluctant to purchase the products and services of Luna, API or the combined company due to uncertainty about the direction of the combined company\u2019s offerings and willingness to support existing products. To the extent that the Merger creates uncertainty among those persons and organizations contemplating purchases such that customers delay, defer or change purchase decisions in connection with the planned Merger, the revenues of Luna, API or the combined company would be adversely affected. Customer assurances may be made by Luna and API to address their customers\u2019 uncertainty about the direction of the combined company\u2019s product and related support offerings, which may result in additional obligations of Luna, API or the combined company. As a result of any of these actions, quarterly revenues and net earnings of Luna, API or the combined company could be substantially below market expectations and a decline in the companies\u2019 respective stock prices could result.\nThe combined company must continue to retain, recruit and motivate executive officers and other key employees, and failure to do so could negatively affect the combined company.\nThe combined company must be successful at retaining, recruiting, and motivating key employees following the completion of the Merger in order for the benefits of the transaction to be fully realized. Employees of both Luna and API may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company until, or even after, strategies with regard to the combined company are announced and executed. The potential distractions related to the Merger may adversely affect the ability of the combined company to keep executives and other key employees focused on business strategies and goals, to address other important personnel matters and to retain them at all. A failure by the combined company to attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees during the period prior to or after the completion of the Merger could have a negative impact on their respective businesses.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS STRATEGY\nIf we cannot successfully transition our revenue mix from contract research revenues to product sales and license revenues, we may not be able to fully execute our business model or grow our business.\nOur business model and future growth depend on our ability to transition to a revenue mix that contains significantly larger product sales and revenues from the provision of services or from licensing. Product sales and these revenues potentially offer greater scalability than contract research revenues. Our current plan is to increase our sales of commercial products, our licensing revenues and our provision of non-research services to customers so as to represent a larger percentage of our total revenues. If we are unable to develop and grow our product sales and revenues from the provision of services or from licensing to augment our contract research revenues, however, our ability to execute our business model or grow our business could suffer. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve increased revenues in this manner.\nIf we are unable to manage growth effectively, our revenues and net loss could be adversely affected.\nWe may need to expand our personnel resources to grow our business effectively. We believe that sustained growth at a higher rate will place a strain on our management as well as on our other human resources. To manage this growth, we must continue to attract and retain qualified management, professional, scientific and technical and operating personnel. If we are unable to recruit a sufficient number of qualified personnel, we may be unable to staff and manage projects adequately, which in turn may slow the rate of growth of our contract research revenues or our product development efforts.\nWe may not be successful in identifying market needs for new technologies or in developing new products.\nPart of our business model depends on our ability to correctly identify market needs for new technologies. We intend to identify new market needs, but we may not always have success in doing so in part because our contract research largely centers on identification and development of unproven technologies, often for new or emerging markets. Furthermore, we must identify the most promising technologies from a sizable pool of projects. If our commercialization strategy process fails to identify projects with commercial potential or if management does not ensure that such projects advance to the commercialization stage, we may not successfully commercialize new products and grow our revenues.\nOur growth strategy requires that we also develop successful commercial products to address market needs. We face several challenges in developing successful new products. Many of our existing products and those currently under development are technologically innovative and require significant and lengthy product development efforts. These efforts include planning, designing, developing and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels. These activities require us to make significant investments. Although there are many potential applications for our technologies, our resource constraints require us to focus on specific products and to forgo other opportunities. We expect that one or more of the potential products we choose to develop will not be technologically feasible or will not achieve commercial acceptance, and we cannot predict which, if any, of our products we will successfully develop or commercialize. The technologies we research and develop are new and steadily changing and advancing. The products that are derived from these technologies may not be applicable or compatible with the state of technology or demands in existing markets. Our existing products and technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete if our competitors adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies and changes in customers\u2019 requirements. Furthermore, we may not be able to identify if and when new markets will open for our products given that future applications of any given product may not be readily determinable, and we cannot reasonably estimate the size of any markets that may develop. If we are not able to successfully develop new products, we may be unable to increase our product revenues.\nWe face and will face substantial competition in several different markets that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe face and will face substantial competition from a variety of companies in several different markets. As we focus on developing marketing and selling fiber optic sensing products, we may also face substantial and entrenched competition in that market.\nMany of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical and other resources than we do. These competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers or other third parties. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors, in which case our revenues may fail to increase or may decline.\nWe have limited experience manufacturing our products in commercial quantities in a cost-effective manner, which could adversely impact our business.\nIn the past, we produced most of our products on a custom order basis rather than pursuant to large contracts that require production on a large volume basis. Accordingly, other than the commercial manufacture of products by our Products and Licensing segment, we have no experience manufacturing products in large volumes. Because our experience in large scale manufacturing is limited, we may encounter unforeseen difficulties in our efforts to manufacture other products or materials in commercial quantities or have to rely on third-party contractors over which we may not have direct control to manufacture our products. We may also encounter difficulties and delays in manufacturing our products for any of the following reasons:\n\u2022\nwe may need to expand our manufacturing operations, and our production processes may have to change to accommodate this growth;\n\u2022\nto increase our manufacturing output significantly, we will have to attract and retain qualified employees, who are in short supply, for the assembly and testing operations;\n\u2022\nwe might have to sub-contract to outside manufacturers which might limit our control of costs and processes; and\n\u2022\nour manufacturing operations may have to comply with government or customer-mandated specifications.\nIf we are unable to keep up with demand for our products, our revenues could be impaired, market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected and our customers might instead purchase our competitors\u2019 products. Moreover, failure to develop and maintain a U.S. market for goods developed with U.S. government-licensed technology may result in the cancellation of the relevant U.S. government licenses. Our inability to manufacture our products successfully would have a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nEven if we are able to manufacture our products on a commercial scale, the cost of manufacturing our products may be higher than we expect. If the costs associated with manufacturing are not significantly less than the prices at which we can sell our products, we may not be able to operate at a profit.\nOur nanotechnology-enabled products are new and may be, or may be perceived as being, harmful to human health or the environment.\nWhile we believe that none of our current products contain chemicals known by us to be hazardous or subject to environmental regulation, it is possible that our current or future products, particularly carbon-based nanomaterials, may become subject to environmental or other regulation. We intend to develop and sell carbon-based nanomaterials as well as nanotechnology-enabled products, which are products that include nanomaterials as a component to enhance those products\u2019 performance. Nanomaterials and nanotechnology-enabled products have a limited historical safety record. Because of their size or shape or because they may contain harmful elements, such as gadolinium and other rare-earth metals, our products could pose a safety risk to human health or the environment. These characteristics may also cause countries to adopt regulations in the future prohibiting or limiting the manufacture, distribution or use of nanomaterials or nanotechnology-enabled products. Such regulations may inhibit our ability to sell some products containing those materials and thereby harm our business or impair our ability to develop commercially viable products.\nThe subject of nanotechnology has received negative publicity and has aroused public debate. Government authorities could, for social or other purposes, prohibit or regulate the use of nanotechnology. Ethical and other concerns about nanotechnology could adversely affect acceptance of our potential products or lead to government regulation of nanotechnology-enabled products.\nWe face risks associated with our international business.\nWe currently conduct business internationally and we might considerably expand our international activities in the future. Our international business operations are subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally, including:\n\u2022\nhaving to comply with U.S. export control regulations and policies that restrict our ability to communicate with non-U.S. employees and supply foreign affiliates and customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in or interpretations of foreign regulations that may adversely affect our ability to sell our products, perform services or repatriate profits to the United States;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of tariffs;\n\u2022\nhyperinflation or economic or political instability in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nimposition of limitations on, or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures;\n\u2022\nconducting business in places where business practices and customs are unfamiliar and unknown;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of restrictive trade policies;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of inconsistent laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nthe imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions or requirements by foreign governments;\n\u2022\nuncertainties relating to foreign laws and legal proceedings;\n\u2022\nhaving to comply with a variety of U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and\n\u2022\nhaving to comply with licensing requirements.\nWe do not know the impact that these regulatory, geopolitical and other factors may have on our international business in the future.\nWe could be negatively affected by a security breach, either through cyber attack, cyber intrusion or other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems.\nWe face the risk, as does any company, of a security breach, whether through cyber attack or cyber intrusion over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, or other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.\nAs a technology company, and particularly as a government contractor, we may face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from threats to gain unauthorized access to our proprietary, confidential or classified information on our IT networks and related systems. These types of information and IT networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers. In addition, as certain of our technological capabilities become widely known, it is possible that we may be subjected to cyber attack or cyber intrusion as third parties seek to gain improper access to information regarding these capabilities and cyber attacks or cyber intrusion could compromise our confidential information or our IT networks and systems generally, as it is not practical as a business matter to isolate all of our confidential information and trade secrets from email and internet access. There can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.\nA security breach or other significant disruption involving these types of information and IT networks and related systems could disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems and therefore our operations, compromise our confidential information and trade secrets, or damage our reputation among our customers and the public generally. Any of these developments could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\nOur operations are subject to domestic and foreign laws, regulations and restrictions, and noncompliance with these laws, regulations and restrictions could expose us to fines, penalties, suspension or debarment, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and overall financial position.\nOur operations, particularly our international sales, subject us to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to imports, exports (including the Export Administration Regulations and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations), technology transfer restrictions, anti-boycott provisions, economic sanctions and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The number of our various emerging technologies, the development of many of which has been funded by the Department of Defense, presents us with many regulatory challenges. Failure by us or our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could result in suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes in regulation\nor political environment may affect our ability to conduct business in foreign markets including investment, procurement and repatriation of earnings.\nOur healthcare and medical products are and may continue to be subject to a lengthy and uncertain domestic regulatory approval process. If we do not obtain and maintain the necessary domestic regulatory approvals or clearances, we will not be able to market and sell our products for clinical use in the United States. Complying with applicable regulations is an expensive and time-consuming process and any failure to fully comply with such regulations could subject us to enforcement actions.\nCertain of our current and potential products could require regulatory clearances or approvals prior to commercialization. For example, any nanomaterial-based MRI contrast agent is likely to be considered a drug under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act. Drugs and some medical devices are subject to rigorous preclinical testing and other approval requirements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, pursuant to the FDC Act, and regulations under the FDC Act, as well as by similar health authorities in foreign countries.\nVarious federal statutes and regulations also govern or influence the testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, packaging, advertising, storage, registration, listing and recordkeeping related to marketing of pharmaceuticals. The process of obtaining these clearances or approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms, if at all. We cannot be certain that any required FDA or other regulatory approval will be granted or, if granted, will not be withdrawn. Our failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, or our failure to obtain them in a timely manner, will prevent or delay our commercialization of new products and our business or our stock price could be adversely affected as a result.\nWe will also become subject to inspection and marketing surveillance by the FDA to determine our compliance with regulatory requirements. If the FDA determines that we have failed to comply, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions ranging from a regulatory letter to a public warning letter to more severe civil and criminal sanctions. Our failure to comply with applicable requirements could lead to an enforcement action that may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our manufacturing facilities do not meet Federal, state or foreign country manufacturing standards, we may be required to temporarily cease all or part of our manufacturing operations, which would result in product delivery delays and negatively impact revenues.\nOur manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities and our operations will continue to be regulated by the FDA for compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice requirements contained in the quality systems regulations. We are also required to comply with International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, quality system standards in order to produce products for sale in Europe. If we fail to continue to comply with Good Manufacturing Practice requirements or ISO standards, we may be required to cease all or part of our operations until we comply with these regulations. Obtaining and maintaining such compliance is difficult and costly. We cannot be certain that our facilities will be found to comply with Good Manufacturing Practice requirements or ISO standards in future inspections and audits by regulatory authorities. In addition, if we cannot maintain or establish manufacturing facilities or operations that comply with such standards or do not meet the expectations of our customers, we may not be able to realize certain economic opportunities in our current or future supply arrangements.\nMedical products are subject to various international regulatory processes and approval requirements. If we do not obtain and maintain the necessary international regulatory approvals for any such potential products, we may not be able to market and sell our medical products in foreign countries.\nTo be able to market and sell medical products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with the regulations of those countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals are expensive, and we cannot be certain that we will have the resources to be able to pursue such approvals or whether we would receive regulatory approvals in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products. For example, the European Union requires that manufacturers of medical products obtain the right to affix the CE mark to their products before selling them in member countries of the European Union, which we have not yet obtained and may never obtain. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products, our ability to generate revenues will be harmed.\nWe are subject to additional significant foreign and domestic government regulations, including environmental and health and safety regulations, and failure to comply with these regulations could harm our business.\nOur facilities and current and proposed activities involve the use of a broad range of materials that are considered hazardous under applicable laws and regulations. Accordingly, we are subject to a number of foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to health and safety, protection of the environment and the storage, use, disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and wastes. We could incur costs, fines and civil and criminal penalties, personal injury and third party property damage claims, or could be required to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental, health and safety laws. Moreover, a failure to comply with environmental laws could result in fines and the revocation of environmental permits, which could prevent us from conducting our business. Liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to fault. There can be no assurance that violations of environmental and health and safety laws will not occur in the future as a result of the inability to obtain permits, human error, equipment failure or other causes. Environmental laws could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could harm our business. Accordingly, violations of present and future environmental laws could restrict our ability to expand facilities, pursue certain technologies, and could require us to acquire costly equipment or incur potentially significant costs to comply with environmental regulations.\nCompliance with foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations represents a small part of our present budget. If we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations, however, a government entity may levy a fine on us or require us to take costly measures to ensure compliance. Any such fine or expenditure may adversely affect our development. We cannot predict the extent to which future legislation and regulation could cause us to incur additional operating expenses, capital expenditures or restrictions and delays in the development of our products and properties.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark protection of our technologies in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as successfully enforcing this intellectual property and defending it against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect our technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable intellectual property protections, such as patents or trade secrets, cover them. In particular, we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes. The degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. The degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is also uncertain for products that are currently in the early stages of development because we cannot predict which of these products will ultimately reach the commercial market or whether the commercial versions of these products will incorporate proprietary technologies.\nOur patent position is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. For example:\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and issued patents;.\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022\nit is possible that none of our pending patent applications or the pending patent applications of our licensors will result in issued patents;\n\u2022\npatents may issue to third parties that cover how we might practice our technology;\n\u2022\nour issued patents and issued patents of our licensors may not provide a basis for commercially viable technologies, may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged and invalidated by third parties; and\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\nPatents may not be issued for any pending or future pending patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and claims allowed under any issued patent or future issued patent owned or licensed by us may not be valid or sufficiently broad to\nprotect our technologies. Moreover, protection of certain of our intellectual property may be unavailable or limited in the United States or in foreign countries, and we have not sought to obtain foreign patent protection for certain of our products or technologies due to cost, concerns about enforceability or other reasons. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us now or in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, and the rights under such patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, and in the case of certain products no foreign patents were filed or can be filed. This could make it easier for competitors to capture or increase their market share with respect to related technologies. We could incur substantial costs to bring suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others or defend ourselves in suits brought against us. An unfavorable outcome of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We regularly attempt to obtain confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions with our collaborators, employees and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how. These agreements may be breached or may not have adequate remedies for such breach. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors or scientific and other advisors, or those of our strategic partners, may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. If we were to enforce a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, our enforcement efforts would be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes unwilling to protect trade secrets. Moreover, if our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, it will be more difficult for us to enforce our rights and our business could be harmed.\nIf we are not able to defend the patent or trade secret protection position of our technologies, then we will not be able to exclude competitors from developing or marketing competing technologies and we may not generate enough revenues from product sales to justify the cost of developing our technologies and to achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe also rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for our company and our products. To maintain the value of our trademarks, we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks. Also, we might not obtain registrations for our pending trademark applications, and we might have to defend our registered trademark and pending trademark applications from challenge by third parties. Enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and damages, including the inability to continue using certain trademarks.\nThird parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result.\nVarious U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in our technology areas. Such third parties may claim that we infringe their patents. Because patent applications can take several years to result in a patent issuance, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our technologies may infringe. For example, we are aware of competitors with patents in technology areas applicable to our optical test equipment products. Such competitors may allege that we infringe these patents. There could also be existing patents of which we are not aware that our technologies may inadvertently infringe. We have from time to time been, and may in the future be, contacted by third parties, including patent assertion entities or intellectual property advisors, about licensing opportunities that also contain claims that we are infringing on third party patent rights. If third parties assert these claims against us, we could incur extremely substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims, and the defense of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we believe we have not infringed on a third party\u2019s patent rights, we may have to settle a claim on unfavorable terms because we cannot afford to litigate the claim. In addition, if third parties assert claims against us and we are unsuccessful in defending against these claims, these third parties may be awarded substantial damages as well as injunctive or other equitable relief against us, which could effectively block our ability to make, use, sell, distribute or market our products and services in the United States or abroad.\nCommercial application of nanotechnologies in particular, or technologies involving nanomaterials, is new and the scope and breadth of patent protection is uncertain. Consequently, the patent positions of companies involved in nanotechnologies have not been tested, and there are complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles will be developed or may remain unresolved. In addition, it is not clear whether such patents will be subject to interpretations or legal doctrines that differ from conventional patent law principles. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our nanotechnology-related intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our nanotechnology-related patents or in third party\npatents. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our technology is subject to retained rights of our licensors, and we may not be able to prevent the loss of those rights or the grant of similar rights to third parties.\nA substantial portion of our technology is licensed from academic institutions, corporations and government agencies. Under these licensing arrangements, a licensor may obtain rights over the technology, including the right to require us to grant a license to one or more third parties selected by the licensor or that we provide licensed technology or material to third parties for non-commercial research. The grant of a license for any of our core technologies to a third party could have a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, some of our licensors retain certain rights under the licenses, including the right to grant additional licenses to a substantial portion of our core technology to third parties for non-commercial academic and research use. It is difficult to monitor and enforce such non-commercial academic and research uses, and we cannot predict whether the third-party licensees would comply with the use restrictions of such licenses. We have incurred and could incur substantial expenses to enforce our rights against them. We also may not fully control the ability to assert or defend those patents or other intellectual property which we have licensed from other entities, or which we have licensed to other entities.\nIn addition, some of our licenses with academic institutions give us the right to use certain technology previously developed by researchers at these institutions. In certain cases we also have the right to practice improvements on the licensed technology to the extent they are encompassed by the licensed patents and are within our field of use. Our licensors may currently own and may in the future obtain additional patents and patent applications that are necessary for the development, manufacture and commercial sale of our anticipated products. We may be unable to agree with one or more academic institutions from which we have obtained licenses whether certain intellectual property developed by researchers at these academic institutions is covered by our existing licenses. In the event that the new intellectual property is not covered by our existing licenses, we would be required to negotiate a new license agreement. We may not be able to reach agreement with current or future licensors on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or the terms may not permit us to sell our products at a profit after payment of royalties, which could harm our business.\nSome of our patents may cover inventions that were conceived or first reduced to practice under, or in connection with, U.S. government contracts or other federal funding agreements. With respect to inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under a federal funding agreement, the U.S. government may retain a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States the invention throughout the world. We may not succeed in our efforts to retain title in patents, maintain ownership of intellectual property or in limiting the U.S. government\u2019s rights in our proprietary technologies and intellectual property when an issue exists as to whether such intellectual property was developed in the performance of a federal funding agreement or developed at private expense.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nWe may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all costs and damages.\nThe stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of technology companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Securities class litigation also often follows certain significant business transactions, such as the sale of a business division or a change in control transaction. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation often is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to comply with all applicable listing requirements or standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market and NASDAQ could delist our common stock.\nOur common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards. There can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with applicable listing standards. In the event that our common stock is not eligible for quotation on another market or exchange, trading of our common stock could be conducted in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board\nestablished for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our common stock, and there would likely also be a reduction in our coverage by security analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. Also, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital if we are not listed on a major exchange.\nOur common stock price has been volatile and we expect that the price of our common stock will fluctuate substantially in the future, which could cause you to lose all or a substantial part of your investment.\nThe public trading price for our common stock is volatile and may fluctuate significantly. Since January 1, 2009, our common stock has traded between a high of $5.00 per share and a low of $0.26 per share. Among the factors, many of which we cannot control, that could cause material fluctuations in the market price for our common stock are:\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by our significant stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur, including sales pursuant to the Form S-3 registration statement described above;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates, investors\u2019 perceptions, recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts\u2019 earnings estimates;\n\u2022\nchanges in our status as an entity eligible to receive SBIR contracts and grants;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us, or by our competitors, of acquisitions, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\npending or threatened litigation;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board of directors or management or any competing proxy solicitations for director nominees;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nannouncements related to patents issued to us or our competitors;\n\u2022\na lack of, limited or negative industry or securities analyst coverage;\n\u2022\ndiscussions of our company or our stock price by the financial and scientific press and online investor communities such as chat rooms; and\n\u2022\ngeneral developments in our industry.\nIn addition, the stock prices of many technology companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. These factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf our internal control over financial reporting is found not to be effective or if we make disclosure of existing or potential significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in those controls, investors could lose confidence in our financial reports, and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to include an internal control report with our Annual Report on Form 10-K. That report must include management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year.\nWe evaluate our existing internal control over financial reporting based on the framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. During the course of our ongoing evaluation of the internal controls, we may identify areas requiring improvement, and may have to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review.
