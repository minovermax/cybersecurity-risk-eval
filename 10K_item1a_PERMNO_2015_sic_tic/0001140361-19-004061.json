Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The following risk factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance and should not be considered to represent a complete set of all potential risks that could affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE CRISTAL TRANSACTION\nOur pending acquisition of the Cristal TiO2 business may not be consummated, the failure to complete the Cristal TiO2 business acquisition could impact our stock price and financial results and the ongoing uncertainty as to whether the transaction will be consummated could all adversely affect our business.\nOn February 21, 2017, we entered into a transaction agreement to acquire the titanium dioxide business of The National Titanium Dioxide Co. Limited (\u201cCristal\u201d) (the \u201cCristal Transaction\u201d). On March 1, 2018, Tronox, Cristal and Cristal Inorganic Chemicals Netherlands Cooperatief W.A. (\u201cCristal Inorganic\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cristal, entered into an Amendment to the Transaction Agreement (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) that extended the termination date under the Transaction Agreement to March 31, 2019, if necessary based on the status of outstanding regulatory approvals. On February 27, 2019, we agreed with Cristal to extend the date on which our acquisition agreement expires from March 31, 2019 to May 19, 2019. Completion of the Cristal Transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including certain regulatory approvals, as more fully described below.\nOn December 5, 2017, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) announced that it would not approve the Cristal Transaction as proposed and filed an administrative action to prevent the parties from consummating the transaction alleging that the Cristal Transaction would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act and Section 5 of the FTC Act. The administrative complaint sought, among other things, a permanent injunction to prevent the transaction from being completed. On December 9, 2018, the administrative law judge issued an initial decision enjoining Tronox from consummating the proposed Cristal Transaction.\nAdditionally, on July 10, 2018, we received notice that the FTC had filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia (the \u201cU.S. District Court\u201d). The complaint alleged that Tronox\u2019s pending acquisition of the TiO2 business of Cristal would violate antitrust laws by significantly reducing competition in the North American market for chloride-process TiO2. On September 5, 2018, the U.S. District Court granted the FTC a preliminary injunction blocking the Cristal Transaction.\nAs a result of the outstanding U.S. regulatory approval, there can be no assurance that all closing conditions for the Cristal Transaction will be satisfied and, if they are satisfied, that they will be satisfied in time for the closing to occur by May 19, 2019, at which time either party to the transaction agreement may mutually agree to extend the closing date or terminate the transaction agreement. If the Cristal Transaction has not closed by May 19, 2019 and the parties have not mutually agreed to extend such date then pursuant to the Amendment, we may be obligated to pay Cristal a $60 million break-fee.\nThe Cristal Transaction is conditioned on the Company obtaining financing sufficient to fund the cash consideration, and the transaction agreement provides that the Company must pay to Cristal a termination fee of $100 million if all conditions to closing, other than the financing condition, have been satisfied and the transaction agreement is terminated because closing of the Cristal Transaction has not occurred by May 19, 2019, and the parties have not mutually agreed to extend such closing date.\nIf the Cristal Transaction is not completed, our ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected and we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022 depending on the reasons for the failure to complete the Cristal Transaction we could be liable to Cristal for a break fee or termination fee or other damages in connection with the termination or breach of the transaction agreement;\n\u2022 we have dedicated and we expect we will continue to commit significant time and resources, financial and otherwise, in planning for the acquisition and the associated integration; and\n\u2022 while the transaction agreement is in effect prior to closing the Cristal Transaction, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies.\nIn addition, if the Cristal Transaction is not completed or is completed subject to significant conditions or remedies, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees. If the acquisition is not completed, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, as well as the price of our ordinary shares.\nFinally, uncertainty about the effect of the Cristal Transaction on employees, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Cristal Transaction is consummated and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause our customers, suppliers and other business partners to delay or defer certain business decisions or to seek to change existing business relationships with us. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, particularly during the period immediately following the closing of the Cristal transaction.\nConcentrated ownership of our ordinary shares by Cristal and Exxaro may prevent minority shareholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest.\nIf the Cristal Transaction is consummated, Cristal Inorganic will own approximately 23.5% of the outstanding ordinary shares of the Company. Following the closing of the Cristal Transaction, Exxaro will own approximately 18% of the Company\u2019s outstanding ordinary shares, based upon its share ownership as of the date of this annual report.\nCristal Inorganic and Exxaro may be able to influence fundamental corporate matters and transactions. This concentration of ownership, may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other shareholders. The interests of Cristal Inorganic and Exxaro may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other shareholders. Also, Cristal Inorganic and Exxaro may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in us, but which might involve risks to our other shareholders or adversely affect us or our other shareholders.\nIn addition, under the shareholders agreement, to be entered into upon the assumed closing of the Cristal Transaction (the \u201cCristal Shareholders Agreement\u201d), among the Company, on the one hand, and Cristal, Cristal Inorganic and the three shareholders of Cristal, on the other hand (collectively, the \u201cCristal Shareholders\u201d), as long as the Cristal Shareholders, collectively, beneficially own at least 24,900,000 or more of Class A Shares, they will have the right to designate for nomination two Class A Directors of the Board (defined below) and, as long as they beneficially own at least 12,450,000 Class A Shares but less than 24,900,000 Class A Shares, they will have the right to designate for nomination one Class A director of the Board. The Cristal Shareholders Agreement also will provide that as long as the Cristal Shareholders own at least 12,450,000 Class A Shares, they will be granted certain preemptive rights. Also under the Cristal Shareholders Agreement, the Company has agreed to file promptly after the closing of the acquisition a registration statement covering approximately four percent of the then-outstanding ordinary shares of the Company, which may be sold as soon as such registration statement is effective. Other than with respect to those shares, the Cristal Shareholders Agreement will include restrictions on Cristal Inorganic\u2019s ability to transfer any of its Class A Shares for a period of three years after the closing of the acquisition other than to certain permitted transferees after the later of eighteen months and the resolution of all indemnification claims under the transaction agreement. The Cristal Shareholders Agreement will also contain certain demand and piggyback registration rights, which commence after the three-year transfer restriction period expires. In addition, if the Cristal Transaction closes subsequent to the Re-Domicile Transaction, then New Tronox shall enter into a shareholders agreement with Cristal, Cristal Inorganic and the three shareholders of Cristal on similar terms and conditions as the Cristal Shareholders Agreement.\nAs a result of these or other factors, including as a result of such offering of shares by Cristal or the perception that such sales may occur, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline. In addition, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our ordinary shares because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with significant shareholders or with significant outstanding shares with registration rights.\nIf the Cristal Transaction is consummated, we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits of the Cristal Transaction, including expected synergies, earnings per share accretion or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) and free cash flow growth.\nThe success of the pending Cristal Transaction will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated cost synergies, earnings per share accretion or EBITDA and free cash flow growth. Our success in realizing these benefits, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of our business and operations with the acquired business and operations. Even if we are able to integrate the acquired businesses and operations successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the pending Cristal Transaction that we currently expect within the anticipated time frame or at all. In addition, any remedial transaction entered into for the purpose of obtaining approval by the FTC may negatively impact our ability to realize any expected synergies, as well as could result in lower than anticipated cost synergies, earnings per share accretion or EBITDA and/or free cash flow growth.\nThere is also the possibility that:\n\u2022 we may fail to realize expected performance optimization, including increased volume production;\n\u2022 the acquisition may result in our assuming unexpected liabilities;\n\u2022 we may experience difficulties integrating operations and systems, as well as company policies, cultures and best practices;\n\u2022 we may fail to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022 problems may arise in entering new markets in which we have little or no experience; and\n\u2022 our post-acquisition revenue projections may be less than anticipated due to loss of customers, price volatility or reduced demand for the combined company\u2019s products.\nIf the Cristal Transaction is consummated, the combined company\u2019s future results could suffer if it does not effectively manage its expanded business, operations and employee base.\nThe size of the combined company\u2019s business, operations and employee base following the Cristal Transaction will be greater than the current standalone size of our business, operations and employee base. The combined company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, operations and employee base, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. We may not be able to successfully manage the combined company\u2019s expanded business, operations and employee base if the Cristal Transaction is consummated.\nWhen we announced the divestiture of the 8120 Grade to Venator Materials PLC (\u201cVenator\u201d) on July 16, 2018 we also announced that we had entered into a binding Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) with Venator providing for the negotiation in good faith of a definitive agreement to sell the entirety of Cristal\u2019s North American operations to Venator if a divestiture of all or a substantial part of Ashtabula was required to secure final FTC regulatory approval for the Cristal Transaction. The MOU granted Venator exclusivity for a period of 75 days to negotiate a definitive agreement for the sale of the entirety of the Ashtabula complex. The MOU also provided for a $75 million break fee (the \u201cBreak Fee\u201d) if, among other things, the parties, despite negotiating in good-faith and in conformity with the terms in the MOU, failed to reach a definitive agreement for the sale of Cristal\u2019s North American operations and Tronox was able to consummate both the Cristal Transaction and the paper-laminate grade divestiture to Venator. On October 1, 2018, we announced that the 75-day exclusivity period under the MOU with Venator had expired without the two companies agreeing to terms. There can be no assurance that if the Cristal Transaction is consummated we will not be required to pay Venator the Break Fee.\nIf the Cristal Transaction is consummated, the combined company will be exposed to the risks of operating a global business in new countries.\nCristal\u2019s TiO2 business operates in certain countries, such as Brazil, China and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in which we have not historically had operations or business. The combined company\u2019s global operations will be subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022 adapting to unfamiliar regional and geopolitical conditions and demands, including political instability, civil unrest, expropriation, nationalization of properties by a government, imposition of sanctions, changes to import or export regulations and fees, renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements, mining leases and permits;\n\u2022 increased difficulties with regard to political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;\n\u2022 economic and commercial instability risks, including those caused by sovereign and private debt default, corruption, and new and unfamiliar laws and regulations at national, regional and local levels, including taxation regimes, tariffs and trade barriers, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings, and labor and environmental and health and safety laws and regulations;\n\u2022 implementation of additional technological and cybersecurity measures and cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect the combined company\u2019s ability to capitalize on opportunities;\n\u2022 cybersecurity attacks, including industrial espionage or ransomware attacks;\n\u2022 major public health issues which could cause disruptions in our operations or workforce;\n\u2022 war or terrorist activities;\n\u2022 difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; and\n\u2022 unexpected events, including fires or explosions at facilities, and natural disasters.\nCristal is currently not a publicly reporting company and the obligations associated with integrating into a public company will require significant resources and management attention.\nCristal is, and prior to the proposed consummation of the Cristal Transaction remains, a private company that is not subject to U.S. financial reporting requirements. If the Cristal Transaction is consummated, the Cristal business will become subject to the rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC and the NYSE. In addition, as a public company, we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, which, by the time our second annual report is filed with the SEC following the consummation of the Cristal Transaction, would include the acquired Cristal business. Bringing Cristal into compliance with these rules and regulations and integrating Cristal into our current compliance and accounting system may require us to make and document significant changes to Cristal\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting, increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. Furthermore, the need to establish the necessary corporate infrastructure to integrate Cristal may divert management\u2019s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, financial condition and results of operations. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our changing enterprise upon the Cristal Transaction and maintain our culture, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur to bring Cristal into compliance with these requirements. In addition, bringing Cristal into compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These additional obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nCristal may have liabilities that are not known to us and the indemnities we have negotiated in the Cristal Transaction Agreement may not adequately protect us.\nIf the Cristal Transaction is consummated, we will assume certain liabilities of Cristal, including significant environmental remediation and monitoring liabilities at Cristal\u2019s current and formerly-owned properties and closure and post-closure costs at certain of Cristal\u2019s mining and landfill facilities. There may be liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations into Cristal. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we integrate Cristal, we may learn additional information about Cristal that may adversely impact us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities, adequacy of financial reserves and issues relating to non-compliance with applicable laws.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE RE-DOMICILE TRANSACTION\nAssuming consummation of the Re-Domicile Transaction, English law and provisions in the new articles of association of New Tronox may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders, and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.\nAssuming consummation of the Re-Domicile Transaction, certain provisions of the U.K. Companies Act 2006 (the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d) and the articles of association of New Tronox may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. For example, New Tronox\u2019s articles of association will include provisions that:\n\u2022 maintain an advance notice procedure for proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022 provide certain mandatory offer provisions, including, among other provisions, that a shareholder, together with persons acting in concert, that acquires 30 percent or more of our issued shares without making an offer to all of our other shareholders that is in cash or accompanied by a cash alternative would be at risk of certain sanctions from our board of directors unless they acted with the prior consent of our board of directors or the prior approval of the shareholders; and\n\u2022 provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled by a vote of the directors or by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders.\nIn addition, public limited companies are prohibited under the Companies Act from taking shareholder action by written resolution. These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nAssuming consummation of the Re-Domicile Transaction, although we do not anticipate New Tronox being subject to the U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, such Takeover Code may still have anti-takeover effects in the event the Takeover Panel determines that such Code is applicable to us.\nAssuming consummation of the Re-Domicile Transaction, the U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (\u201cTakeover Code\u201d) applies, among other things, to an offer for a public company whose registered office is in the U.K. (or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man) and whose securities are not admitted to trading on a regulated market in the U.K. (or on any stock exchange in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man) if the company is considered by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (\u201cTakeover Panel\u201d) to have its place of central management and control in the U.K. (or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man). This is known as the \u201cresidency test.\u201d The test for central management and control under the Takeover Code is different from that used by the U.K. tax authorities. Under the Takeover Code, the Takeover Panel will determine whether we have our place of central management and control in the U.K. by looking at various factors, including the structure of our board of directors, the functions of the directors and where they are resident.\nGiven that a majority of the members of our Board of Directors are expected to reside outside the United Kingdom, we do not anticipate that New Tronox will be subject to the Takeover Code. However, if at the time of a takeover offer subsequent to the Re-Domicile Transaction the Takeover Panel determines that we have our place of central management and control in the U.K., we would be subject to a number of rules and restrictions, including but not limited to the following: (1) our ability to enter into deal protection arrangements with a bidder would be extremely limited; (2) we might not, without the approval of our shareholders, be able to\nperform certain actions that could have the effect of frustrating an offer, such as issuing shares or carrying out acquisitions or disposals; and (3) we would be obliged to provide equality of information to all bona fide competing bidders.\nAssuming consummation of the Re-Domicile Transaction, as a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales, certain capital structure decisions will require approval of New Tronox\u2019s shareholders, which may limit our flexibility to manage our capital structure.\nThe Companies Act generally provides that a board of directors of a public limited company may only allot shares (or grant rights to subscribe for or convertible into shares) with the prior authorization of shareholders, such authorization stating the maximum amount of shares that may be allotted under such authorization and specify the date on which such authorization will expire, being not more than five years, each as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution. We have obtained previous shareholder authority for New Tronox to allot additional shares for a period of five years from February 25, 2019, which authorization will need to be renewed at least upon expiration (five years from February 25, 2019) but may be sought more frequently for additional five-year terms (or any shorter period).\nThe Companies Act generally provides that existing shareholders of a company have statutory pre-emption rights when new shares in such company are allotted and issued for cash. However, it is possible for such statutory pre-emption right to be disapplied by either shareholders passing a special resolution at a general meeting, being a resolution passed by at least 75% of the votes cast, or by inclusion of relevant provisions in the articles of association of the company. Such a disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights may not be for more than five years. We have obtained previous shareholder authority for New Tronox to disapply statutory pre-emption rights for a period of five years from February 25, 2019, which disapplication will need to be renewed upon expiration (i.e., at least every five years) to remain effective, but may be sought more frequently for additional five-year terms (or any shorter period).\nThe Companies Act generally prohibits a public limited company from repurchasing its own shares without the prior approval of its shareholders by ordinary resolution, being a resolution passed by a simple majority of votes cast, and subject to compliance with other statutory formalities. Such authorization may not be for more than five years from the date on which such ordinary resolution is passed. We have obtained previous shareholder authority for New Tronox to repurchase shares for a period of five years from February 25, 2019, which authorization will need to be renewed at least upon expiration (i.e., five years from February 25, 2019) but may be sought more frequently for additional five-year terms (or any shorter period).\nAssuming consummation of the Re-Domicile Transaction, economic conditions and regulatory changes following the U.K.\u2019s likely exit from the E.U. could adversely impact our operations, operating results and financial condition.\nThe U.K. held a referendum in June 2016 to determine whether the U.K. should leave the E.U. or remain as a member state, the outcome of which was in favor of leaving the E.U. The U.K. government initiated the formal process to leave the E.U. (often referred to as Brexit) on March 29, 2017, which will result in the U.K. leaving the E.U. on March 29, 2019 unless the U.K. revokes the notification of its intention to leave or the remaining E.U. member states and the U.K. unanimously decide to extend this period. The referendum triggered financial volatility, including a decline in the value of the British pound sterling in comparison to both the U.S. dollar and euro. It is expected that Brexit will continue to impact economic conditions in the U.K. and the E.U. The future effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to the E.U. or other markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Given the lack of comparable precedent, assuming consummation of the Re-Domicile Transaction, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have and how such withdrawal will affect us.\nThe consequences of Brexit, together with the significant uncertainty regarding the terms on which the U.K. will leave the E.U., could introduce significant uncertainties into global financial markets and adversely impact the markets in which we and our customers operate. Brexit could also create uncertainty with respect to the legal and regulatory requirements to which we are subject and lead to divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. government determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate.\nDue to Brexit, adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions, volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation could have a negative impact on our future operations, operating results and financial condition. All of these potential consequences could be further magnified if additional countries were to seek to exit the E.U.\nAssuming consummation of the Re-Domicile Transaction, exposure to U.K. political developments could affect us.\nAssuming consummation of the Re-Domicile Transaction, political change in the U.K. has the potential to directly affect New Tronox through the introduction of new laws (including tax laws) or regulations. The current government in the U.K. is a minority government and any future change in government in the U.K. could affect us due to changes in government policy, legislation or regulatory interpretation.\nSubsequent to the Re-Domicile Transaction, transfers of shares in New Tronox outside The Depository Trust may be subject to stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax in the U.K., which would increase the cost of dealing in shares in New Tronox.\nAssuming consummation of the Re-Domicile Transaction, except for any new ordinary shares which are to be received by a holder deemed to be an affiliate of New Tronox for purposes of U.S. securities laws, it is anticipated that the ordinary shares of New Tronox will be issued to a nominee for The Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d) and corresponding book-entry interests credited in the facilities of DTC. On the basis of current law and HM Revenue and Customs (\u201cHMRC\u201d) practice, no charges to U.K. stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (\u201cSDRT\u201d) are expected to arise on the issue of the ordinary shares into DTC\u2019s facilities or on transfers of book-entry interests in ordinary shares within DTC\u2019s facilities.\nShareholders are strongly encouraged to hold their ordinary shares in book entry form through DTC. Transfers of shares held in book entry form through DTC currently do not attract a charge to stamp duty or SDRT in the U.K. A transfer of title in the shares from within the DTC system out of DTC and any subsequent transfers that occur entirely outside the DTC system will attract a charge to stamp duty at a rate of 0.5% of any consideration, which is payable by the transferee of the shares. Any such duty must be paid (and the relevant transfer document, if any, stamped by HMRC) before the transfer can be registered in the books of New Tronox. However, if those shares are redeposited into DTC, the redeposit will attract stamp duty or SDRT at the rate of 1.5% to be paid by the transferor.\nIn connection with the consummation of the Re-Domicile Transaction, we expect to put in place arrangements to require that New Tronox\u2019s directly held ordinary shares cannot be transferred into the DTC system until the transferor of the ordinary shares has first delivered the ordinary shares to a depositary specified by us so that SDRT may be collected in connection with the initial delivery to the depositary. Any such ordinary shares will be evidenced by a receipt issued by the depositary. Before the transfer can be registered in our books, the transferor will also be required to put the depositary in funds to settle the resultant liability to SDRT, which will be charged at a rate of 1.5% of the value of the shares.\nAssuming consummation of the Re-Domicile Transaction, New Tronox\u2019s articles of association will provide that the courts of England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction to determine any dispute brought by a shareholder in that shareholder\u2019s capacity as such and certain other matters.\nAssuming consummation of the Re-Domicile Transaction, New Tronox\u2019s articles of association will provide that the courts of England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction to determine any dispute brought by a shareholder in that shareholder\u2019s capacity as such, or related to or connected with any derivative claim in respect of a cause of action vested in New Tronox or seeking relief on behalf of New Tronox, against New Tronox and/or the board and/or any of the directors, former directors, officers, employees or shareholders individually, arising out of or in connection with our new articles of association or (to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law) otherwise. This choice of forum provision may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder believes is favorable for disputes with New Tronox or its directors, former directors, officers, employees or shareholders which may discourage lawsuits against New Tronox and its directors, former directors, officers, employees or shareholders.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nMarket conditions, as well as global and regional economic downturns that adversely affect the demand for our end-use products could adversely affect the results of our operations and the prices at which we can sell our products, negatively impacting our financial results.\nOur revenue and results of operations are significantly dependent on direct sales of our TiO2 products, zircon, pig iron and feedstock/other products to customers. Demand for our products historically has been linked to global, regional and local GDP and discretionary spending, which can be negatively impacted by regional and world events or economic and market conditions. Such events can cause a decrease in demand for our products and market prices to fall, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities that reprice as market supply and demand fundamentals change. Accordingly, product margins and the results of operations tend to vary with changes in the business cycle.\nA significant portion of the demand for our products comes from manufacturers of paint and plastics, and other industrial customers, as well as from customers in the ceramics industry. Companies that operate in the industries that these industries serve, including automotive and construction, may experience significant fluctuations in demand for their own end products because of economic conditions, changes in consumer demand, or increases in raw material and energy costs. In addition, many large end users of our products depend upon the availability of credit on favorable terms to make purchases of raw materials such as TiO2. As interest rates increase or if our customers\u2019 creditworthiness deteriorates, this credit may be expensive or difficult to obtain. If these customers cannot obtain credit on favorable terms, they may be forced to reduce their purchases. These and other factors may lead some customers to seek renegotiation or cancellation of their arrangements with our businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe price of our products, in particular, TiO2 pigment, zircon, pig iron and feedstock/other products, have been, and in the future may be, volatile. Price declines for our products will negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.\nHistorically, the global market for TiO2 pigment, zircon, pig iron and feedstock/other products have been volatile, and those markets are likely to remain volatile in the future. Prices for TiO2 pigment, zircon, pig iron and feedstock/other products may fluctuate in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of, and demand for, these products, market uncertainty and other factors beyond our control.\nFactors that affect the price of our products include, among other things:\n\u2022 overall economic conditions;\n\u2022 the level of customer demand, including in the paint and plastics industries;\n\u2022 the level of production and exports of our products globally;\n\u2022 the level of production and cost of materials used to produce our products;\n\u2022 the cost of energy consumed in the production of TiO2, feedstock and related co-products, including the price of natural gas, electricity and coal;\n\u2022 the impact of competitors increasing their capacity and exports;\n\u2022 domestic and foreign governmental relations, tariffs or other trade disputes, regulations and taxes; and\n\u2022 political conditions or hostilities and unrest in regions where we export our TiO2, feedstock and related co-products.\nPricing pressure with respect to our TiO2 pigment products, zircon, pig iron and feedstock/other products can make it difficult to predict the cash we may have on hand at any given time, and a prolonged period of price declines may materially and adversely affect our financial position, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations.\nOur industry and the end-use markets in which we compete are highly competitive. This competition may adversely affect our results of operations and operating cash flows.\nEach of our markets is highly competitive. Competition in the TiO2 industry is based on a number of factors such as price, product quality, and service. We face significant competition from major international and smaller\nregional competitors. We also compete with Chinese producers that have significantly expanded their production capacity in recent years and have also commenced the commercial production of TiO2 via chloride technology. The risk of substitution of these Chinese producers by our customers could increase as these Chinese producers expand their use of chloride technology and continue to improve the quality of their sulfate products.\nMoreover, we compete with a large number of mining companies with respect to zircon. Zircon producers generally compete on the basis of price, quality, logistics, delivery, and payment terms and consistency of supply.\nWithin the end-use markets in which we compete, competition between products is intense. We face substantial risk that certain events, such as new product development by competitors, changing customer needs, increased commercial production of TiO2 via chloride technology, greater acceptance of TiO2 via sulfate technology in end-market applications hereto for characterized by TiO2 via chloride technology, production advances for competing products, or price changes in raw materials, could cause our customers to switch to our competitors\u2019 products. Our inability to develop and produce or market our products to compete effectively against our competitors following such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nAn increase in the price of energy or other raw materials, or an interruption in our energy or other raw material supply, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur mining, beneficiation, smelting and production processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which can be subject to worldwide, as well as, local supply and demand, as well as other factors beyond our control. In 2018, ore, process chemicals and energy used in the production of TiO2 constituted approximately 41%, 17% and 11%, respectively, of our operating expenses. Fuel and energy linked to commodities, such as diesel, heavy fuel oil and coal, and other consumables, such as chlorine, illuminating paraffin, electrodes, and anthracite, consumed in our TiO2 manufacturing and mining operations form an important part of our TiO2 operating costs. We have no control over the costs of these consumables, many of which are linked to some degree to the price of oil and coal, and the costs of many of these raw materials may fluctuate widely for a variety of reasons, including changes in availability, major capacity additions or reductions, or significant facility operating problems. These fluctuations could negatively affect our operating margins, our results of operations or planned capital expenditures. As these costs rise, our operating expenses will increase and could adversely affect our business, especially if we are unable to pass price increases in raw materials through to our customers.\nThe markets for many of our products have seasonally affected sales patterns.\nThe demand for our products is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Because TiO2 is widely used in paint and other coatings, titanium feedstocks are in higher demand prior to the painting season in the Northern Hemisphere (spring and summer), and pig iron is in lower demand during the European summer holidays, when many steel plants and foundries undergo maintenance. Additionally, although zircon is generally a non-seasonal product, it is negatively impacted by the winter and Chinese New Year celebrations due to reduced zircon demand from China. We may be adversely affected by existing or future cyclical changes, and such conditions may be sustained or further aggravated by anticipated or unanticipated changes in regional weather conditions. For example, poor weather conditions in a region can lead to an abbreviated painting season, which can depress consumer sales of paint products that use TiO2.\nExxaro continues to hold a large portion of our total outstanding voting securities, as well as retains distinct governance and other rights as a result of our 2012 acquisition of Exxaro\u2019s mineral sands businesses.\nAt December 31, 2018, Exxaro held approximately 23% of our voting securities, and had two representatives serving as Directors on our nine-member board. On March 8, 2017, Exxaro announced its intention to begin pursuing a path to sell its ownership stake in us over time. In part to facilitate the sale by Exxaro of its Tronox shares in an orderly, predictable manner, we entered into the Completion Agreement with Exxaro which sets forth the terms under which Exxaro may further monetize its remaining stake during the course of 2019, with any such monetization being subject to market conditions. Future sales by Exxaro of our shares will result in additional Class B Shares converting to Class A Shares and an increase in the number of Class A Shares outstanding which could cause the market price of our shares to decline.\nDue to Exxaro\u2019s current ownership interest, it is entitled to certain governance rights under our Constitution and Shareholder\u2019s Deed. For example, the Constitution provides that, for as long as the Class B voting interest is at least 10% of our total voting interest, there must be nine directors on our board; of which the holders of Class A Shares will be entitled to vote separately to elect a certain number of directors to our board (which we refer to as Class A Directors), and the holders of Class B Shares will be entitled to vote separately to elect a certain number of directors to our board (which we refer to as Class B Directors). If the Class B voting interest is greater than or equal to 20% but less than 30%, our board of directors will consist of seven Class A Directors and two Class B Directors. If the Class B voting interest is greater than or equal to 10% but less than 20%, our board will consist of eight Class A Directors and one Class B Director.\nThe Constitution also provides that, subject to certain limitations, for as long as the Class B voting interest is at least 20%, a separate vote by holders of Class A Shares and Class B Shares is required to approve certain types of merger or similar transactions that will result in a change in control or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any reorganization or transaction that does not treat Class A and Class B Shares equally.\nAs a result of Exxaro\u2019s current ownership interest and its governance rights, Exxaro may be able to exert substantial influence over our management, operations and potential significant corporate transactions, including a change in control or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Exxaro\u2019s influence may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our ordinary shares.\nOur South African mining rights are subject to onerous regulatory requirements imposed by legislation and the Department of Mineral Resources (the \u201cDMR\u201d), the compliance of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBlack economic empowerment (\u201cBEE\u201d) legislation was introduced into South Africa as a means to seek to redress the inequalities of the previous Apartheid system by requiring the inclusion of historically disadvantaged South Africans in the mainstream economy. Under BEE legislation, South African businesses are generally required to become \u201cempowered\u201d and in the mining sector comply with a distinct \u201csector charter.\u201d As of March 1, 2019, South African mining companies, such as ourselves, will be required to comply with Mining Charter III which was first promulgated by the DMR in September, 2018. While Mining Charter II previously required a 26% ownership by a BEE empowered entity, new Mining Charter III requires a 30% BEE shareholding that must be structured through a special purpose vehicle comprised of black entrepreneurs, the local community surrounding the relevant mining area and eligible employees. In addition, Mining Charter III sets forth new requirements with regard to the procurement of goods and services from BEE compliant entities; race, age and gender based ownership criteria and employment quotas; and workers\u2019 housing and living conditions. While we believe we are currently in compliance with the provisions of Mining Charter III, the implementation guidelines promulgated in December 2018 are complex and remain untested. As a result, the manner in which Mining Charter III is enforced by the DMR may result in material adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nPrior to December 2017, Exxaro, by virtue of the fact that it was greater than 50% owned by historically disadvantaged South Africans and that it held a 26% ownership interest in our two South African operating entities, had historically been our BEE empowered entity allowing us to comply with the requirements of the MPRDA and Mining Charter II, the predecessor sector charter to Mining Charter III, for purposes of our existing mining rights. We believe that under Mining Charter III for the duration of our current mining rights the fact that we no longer have a BEE empowered entity holding 26% ownership interest in our two South African operating entities will not impact those rights negatively and that the \u201conce empowered always empowered\u201d principle applies to our existing mining rights. However, Mining Charter III will require that any new mining rights that we may desire to acquire in the future will require 30% historically disadvantaged South African ownership in the ratios set out in Mining Charter III.\nThe \u201conce empowered always empowered\u201d principle asserts that a South African company that has had the requisite shareholding base consisting of historically disadvantaged South Africans as at December 31, 2014 will always qualify as an \u201cempowered\u201d entity. The question of whether the \u201conce empowered always empowered\u201d principle applies in the mining industry in South Africa has been subject to litigation between the Minerals Council of South Africa (the \u201cMinerals Council\u201d) (formerly the Chamber of Mines, an industry body that represents approximately 90% of the South African Mining Industry) and the DMR. The South African High Court decided in the affirmative for the Minerals Council. It is our opinion that the \u201conce empowered always empowered\u201d is applicable to our existing mining rights, but not in respect of applications for renewals of\nexisting mining rights or applications for new mining rights made under the Mining Charter III. In the event that the DMR were to challenge our compliance with Mining Charter III or the \u201conce empowered always empowered principle is otherwise not fully recognized, such decision could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nWe may elect to exercise certain \u201cflip in\u201d rights to buy-out Exxaro\u2019s 26% ownership rights in our South African subsidiaries which might negatively impact the ownership of our heavy mineral sands mining rights.\nIn connection with the Exxaro transaction, Exxaro was granted a \u201cflip in\u201d right such that following the occurrence of certain events, Exxaro would be entitled to exchange its 26% shareholding in our South African operating subsidiaries which hold our mining licenses for an additional 7.2 million Class B Shares. The Completion Agreement amends the \u201cflip-in\u201d rights granted to Exxaro so that Tronox may, subject to certain conditions, accelerate the occurrence of the \u201cflip in.\u201d If Tronox elects to accelerate the \u201cflip in\u201d there can be no assurance that the DMR will not challenge our right to continue to operate our mineral sands mining operations based upon the failure of our South African subsidiaries to be \u201cempowered\u201d (i.e. maintain 26% ownership by a BEE empowered entity). If DMR\u2019s challenge is successful, our existing mining rights could be suspended or revoked which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations.\nSouth Africa, where we have large mining assets and derive a significant portion of our revenue and profit, poses distinct operational risks which could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn South Africa, we currently operate two significant mining assets, as well as accompanying separation plants and smelting operations, and derive a portion of our profit from the sale of zircon.\nOur mining and smelting operations depend on electrical power generated by Eskom, the sole, state-owned energy supplier. The South African government has announced a critical shortage of coal required for energy generation and, as such, \u201cload-shedding\u201d (planned and unplanned rolling power outages) is expected for the foreseeable future. In addition, South African electricity prices have risen during the past few years, and future prices increases are expected to occur. In addition, our KZN Sands operations currently use approximately 356,000 gigajoules of Sasol gas, which is available only from Sasol Limited. As such, restrictions or additional conditions imposed by Eskom such as load shedding, electricity restrictions and/or electricity price increases, as well as an interruption in the supply of Sasol gas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations; however, a project is underway to replace approximately 30% to 44% of our current Sasol gas usage with furnace off-gas produced by KZN Sands.\nMoreover, we use significant amounts of water in our South African operations which could result in significant costs. Under South African law, our South African mining operations are subject to water-use licenses that govern each operation. These licenses require, among other conditions, that mining operations achieve and maintain certain water quality limits for all water discharges, where applicable. However, changes to water-use licenses could affect our operational results and financial condition. Additionally, certain regions of South Africa have experienced in the past, and are prone to drought conditions resulting in water restrictions being imposed in such areas. A prolonged drought in a region of South Africa where our operations are located may lead to water use restrictions which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations in South Africa are also reliant on services provided by the State owned, and sole provider of rail transport, Transnet, for limited rail transport services at Namakwa Sands. Furthermore, Transnet provides extensive dockside services at both the ports of Richards Bay and Saldanha Bay via Transnet Port Authority. Delays or interruptions at either the rail service or the ports in which we receive and/or export material could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe aforementioned operational risks, as well as any other foreseen or unforeseen operational risks primarily related to doing business in South Africa, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs an emerging market, South Africa poses a challenging array of long-term political and economic risks.\nSouth Africa continues to undergo political and economic challenges. Changes to, or instability in, the economic or political environment in South Africa, especially if such changes create political instability, actual or potential shortages of production materials or labor unrest, could result in production delays and production shortfalls, and materially impact our production and results of operations.\nThe South African government has recently embarked on a process of identifying and securing land for persons who were previously dispossessed of such land as a result of Apartheid policies. In December 2018, the South African government released a draft land expropriation bill for public comment. The land expropriation bill contemplates that, where it is in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d, land may be expropriated by the South African government, without compensation being payable to the current owners. While the South African government has indicated that such measures will be applied initially to state-owned land, it is possible that such measures may extend to agricultural and mining areas. We own the majority of the land on which the Namakwa Sands and KZN Sands operations are situated and have invested considerable funds in developing these areas. In the event that these areas become the subject of a land claim under any such proposed or future land expropriation bill, it may have a material adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, South Africa\u2019s exchange control regulations require resident companies to obtain the prior approval of the South African Reserve Bank to raise capital in any currency other than the Rand, and restrict the export of capital from South Africa. While the South African government has relaxed exchange controls in recent years, it is difficult to predict whether or how it will further change or abolish exchange control measures in the future. These exchange control restrictions could hinder our financial and strategic flexibility, particularly our ability to use South African capital to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures, and new projects outside of South Africa.\nMoreover, our operations have been affected by inflation in South Africa in recent years. Working costs and wages in South Africa have increased in recent years, resulting in significant cost pressures for the mining industry. Prolonged or heightened inflation and associated cost pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to use our tax attributes to offset future income may be limited.\nOur ability to use any net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and Section 163(j) interest expense carryforwards (which are now subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Code per the U.S. tax reform bill enacted on December 22, 2017 (the \u201cTax Reform Act\u201d) generated by us could be substantially limited if we were to experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Code. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d would occur if our \u201c5-percent shareholders,\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Code, including certain groups of persons treated as \u201c5-percent shareholders,\u201d collectively increased their ownership in us by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Pursuant to the Completion Agreement, Exxaro has agreed to sell down its remaining ownership interest in us in a manner that we believe will not cause us to lose, under limitations set forth in Section 382 of the Code, the benefit of approximately $4.1 billion of NOLs and/or the approximately $1.1 billion of Section 163(j) interest expense carryforwards. Additionally, assuming the consummation of the Re-Domicile Transaction, our board of directors will have the ability to establish a shareholder rights plan to prevent an \u201cownership change\u201d for the purpose of Section 382 of the Code. Although we believe the Completion Agreement and Re-Domicile Transaction should provide sufficient protection of the approximately $4.1 billion of NOLs and/or the approximately $1.1 billion of Section 163(j) interest expense carryforwards, there can be no assurance that an \u201cownership change\u201d for U.S. federal and applicable state income tax purposes will not occur in the future. A corporation that experiences an ownership change will generally be subject to an annual limitation on the use of its pre-ownership change NOLs (and certain other losses and/or credits) equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate for the month in which the ownership change occurs. Although our NOLs continue to have full valuation allowances, such a limitation could, for any given year, have the effect of increasing the amount of our U.S. federal income tax liability, which would negatively impact our financial condition and the amount of after-tax cash available for distribution to holders of our ordinary shares if declared by our board of directors.\nWe are a holding company that is dependent on cash flows from our operating subsidiaries to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures and ongoing operations.\nAll of our operations are conducted and all of our assets are owned by our operating companies, which are our subsidiaries. We intend to continue to conduct our operations at the operating companies and any future subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations or make cash distributions depends upon the cash flow of our operating companies and any future subsidiaries, and the payment of funds by our operating companies and any future subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise. The ability of our\noperating companies and any future subsidiaries to make any payments to us depends on their earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, including the terms of any credit facilities, or indentures, and legal restrictions regarding the transfer of funds.\nOur ability to service our debt and fund our planned capital expenditures and ongoing operations will depend on our ability to generate and increase cash flow, and our access to additional liquidity sources. Our ability to generate and increase cash flow is dependent on many factors, including:\n\u2022 the transfer of funds from subsidiaries in the U.S. to certain foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices or to raise prices to offset, in whole or in part, the effects of higher raw material costs;\n\u2022 the selling price of our products;\n\u2022 our ability to adequately deliver customer service and competitive product quality;\n\u2022 the impact of competition from other chemical and materials manufacturers and diversified companies;\n\u2022 general world business conditions, economic uncertainty or downturn and the significant downturn in housing construction and overall economies;\n\u2022 the effects of governmental regulation on our business;\n\u2022 tariff, trade duties and other trade barriers; and\n\u2022 political and social instability.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. A general economic downturn can result in reduced spending by customers, which will impact our revenues and cash flows from operating activities. At reduced performance, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or access additional liquidity sources, we may not be able to service and repay our existing debt, operate our business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund our other liquidity and capital needs.\nThe agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could affect our ability to operate our business, as well as impact our liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our total principal amount of debt was approximately $3.2 billion. Our credit facilities contain covenants that could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our liquidity, and our results of operations. These covenants restrict, among other things, our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022 incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 complete asset sales, acquisitions or mergers;\n\u2022 make investments and capital expenditures;\n\u2022 prepay other indebtedness;\n\u2022 enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022 fund additional dividends or repurchase shares.\nCertain of our indebtedness facilities and senior notes include requirements relating to the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to indebtedness or certain fixed charges. The breach of any covenants or obligations in our credit facilities, not otherwise waived or amended, could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations (and cross-defaults to certain other debt obligations) and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger other cross defaults under other existing or future agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. In addition, the secured lenders under the credit facilities could foreclose on their collateral, which includes equity interests in our subsidiaries, and exercise other rights of secured creditors. Any default under those credit facilities could adversely affect our growth, our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our credit facilities, and could force us to seek the protection of bankruptcy laws.\nWe may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, and such capital expenditure projects may not realize expected investment returns.\nOur business is capital intensive, and our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our manufacturing operations and invest in those operations to expand capacity and remain competitive from a cost perspective. We may require additional capital in the future to finance capital investments, including any potential expansion or optimization of existing facilities, fund ongoing research and development activities and meet general working capital needs. Additionally, we entered into the Option Agreement with AMIC pursuant to which AMIC granted us an option to acquire 90% of a SPV, to which AMIC\u2019s ownership in the Slagger in The Jazan City for Primary and Downstream Industries in the KSA will be contributed together with $322 million of indebtedness currently held by AMIC. Upon exercise of the call or put option, there can be no assurance that we may assume this indebtedness and may need to obtain funding to repay it. Additional financing may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate funds on acceptable terms, we may be unable to maintain, expand or lower the operating costs of our facilities or take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, which could harm our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects. Additionally, if we undertake these projects, they may not be completed on schedule, at the budgeted cost, or at all. Moreover, our revenue may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. As a result, we may not be able to realize our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nThe financial condition and results of operations of our operating entities outside the U.S. are reported in various foreign currencies, primarily the South African Rand, Australian Dollars and Euros, and then converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in the financial statements. As a result, any volatility of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies creates uncertainty for, and may have a negative impact on, reported sales and operating margin. We have made a U.S. dollar functional currency election for both Australian financial reporting and federal income tax purposes. On this basis, our Australian entities report their results of operations on a U.S. dollar basis. In addition, our operating entities often need to convert currencies they receive for their products into currencies in which they purchase raw materials or pay for services, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates. In order to manage this risk, we have, from time to time, entered into forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currencies.\nOur flexibility in managing our labor force may be adversely affected by labor and employment laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, many of which are more onerous than those of the U.S.; and some of our labor force has substantial workers\u2019 council or trade union participation, which creates a risk of disruption from labor disputes and new laws affecting employment policies.\nLabor costs constituted approximately 28% of our production costs (excluding ore cost) in 2018. The majority of our employees are located outside the U.S. In most of those countries, labor and employment laws are more onerous than in the U.S. and, in many cases, grant significant job protection to employees, including rights on termination of employment.\nIn South Africa, over 74% of our workforce belongs to a union. In Australia, most employees are not currently represented by a union, but approximately 46% are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. In the Netherlands, approximately 49% of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement and 27% are members of a union.\nOur South African operations have entered into various agreements regulating wages and working conditions at our mines. There have been periods when various stakeholders have been unable to agree on dispute resolution processes, leading to threats of disruptive labor disputes, although only two strikes have ever occurred in the history of these operations. Due to the high level of employee union membership, our South African operations are at risk of production stoppages for indefinite periods due to strikes and other labor disputes. Although we believe that we have good labor relations with our South African employees, we may experience labor disputes in the future.\nSouth African employment law, which is based on the minimum standard set by the International Labor Organization, sets out minimum terms and conditions of employment for employees. Although these may be improved by agreements between an employer and the trade unions, prescribed minimum terms and conditions\nform the benchmark for all employment contracts. Our South African operations are required to submit a report to the South African Department of Labor under South African employment law detailing the progress made towards achieving employment equity in the workplace. Failing to submit this report in a timely manner could result in substantial penalties. In addition, future legislative developments that affect South African employment policies may increase production costs or negatively impact relationships with employees and trade unions, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are required to consult with, and seek the consent or advice of, various employee groups or works\u2019 councils that represent our employees for any changes to our activities or employee benefits. This requirement could have a significant impact on our flexibility in managing costs and responding to market changes.\nGiven the nature of our chemical, mining and smelting operations, we face a material risk of liability, production delays and additional expenditures from environmental and industrial accidents.\nOur business is exposed to, among other things, environmental hazards and industrial accidents the occurrence of which could delay production, suspend operations, increase repair, maintenance or medical costs and, due to the integration of our facilities, could have an adverse effect on the productivity and results of operations of a particular manufacturing facility or on our business as a whole. Furthermore, during operational breakdowns resulting from any such environmental hazard or industrial facility, the relevant facility may not become fully operational within the anticipated timeframe, which could result in further business losses. Over our operating history, we have incurred incidents of this nature. If any of the equipment on which we depend were severely damaged or were destroyed by fire, flooding, or otherwise, we may be unable to replace or repair it in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost, which would impact our ability to produce and ship our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEquipment upgrades, equipment failures and deterioration of assets may lead to production curtailments, shutdowns or additional expenditures.\nOur operations depend upon critical equipment that require scheduled upgrades and maintenance and may suffer unanticipated breakdowns or failures. As a result, our mining operations and processing plants may be interrupted or curtailed by equipment failures, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, assets critical to our mining and chemical processing operations may deteriorate due to wear and tear or otherwise sooner than we currently estimate. Such deterioration may result in additional maintenance spending and additional capital expenditures. If these assets do not generate the amount of future cash flows that we expect, and we are not able to refurbish them or procure replacement assets in an economically feasible manner, our future results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be seriously impacted by security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents.\nWe rely on information technology systems across our operations, including internal and external communications, and the management of our accounting, finance, and supply chain functions. Our information technology is provided by a combination of internal and external services and service providers. Further, our business involves the use, processing, storage and transmission of information about customers, suppliers and employees using such information technology systems. Our ability to effectively operate our business depends on the security, reliability and capacity of these systems.\nLike most major corporations, we may become the target of cyberattacks, including industrial espionage or ransomware attacks, from time to time. Failure to effectively prevent, detect and recover from security breaches, including attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers; viruses; breaches due to employee error or actions; or other disruptions could seriously harm our operations as well as the operations of our customers and suppliers. Such serious harm can involve, among other things, misuse of our assets, business disruptions, loss of data, unauthorized access to trade secrets and confidential business information, unauthorized access to personal information, legal claims or proceedings, reporting errors, processing inefficiencies, negative media attention, reputational harm, loss of sales, remediation and increased insurance costs, and interference with regulatory compliance. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of cybersecurity threats and incidents, which may be material.\nWe have put in place security measures designed to protect against cyberattacks, security breaches and misappropriation or corruption of our systems, intentional or unintentional disclosure of confidential information,\nor disruption of our operations. As these threats continue to evolve, particularly around cybersecurity, we may be required to expend significant resources to enhance our control environment, processes, practices and other protective measures. Despite these efforts, we may not be able to prevent cyberattacks and other security breaches and such events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with the anti-corruption laws of the U.S. and various international jurisdictions could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations.\nDoing business on a global basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and those of various international jurisdictions, and our failure to successfully comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to liabilities. In particular, our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (\u201cU.K. Bribery Act\u201d), as well as anti-corruption laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our global operations may expose us to the risk of violating, or being accused of violating, the foregoing or other anti-corruption laws. Such violations could be punishable by criminal fines, imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, and exclusion from government contracts, as well as other remedial measures. Investigations of alleged violations can be very expensive, disruptive, and damaging to our reputation. Although we have implemented anti-corruption policies and procedures, there can be no guarantee that these policies, procedures, and training will effectively prevent violations by our employees or representatives in the future. Additionally, we face a risk that our distributors and other business partners may violate the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, or similar laws or regulations. Such violations could expose us to FCPA and U.K. Bribery Act liability and/or our reputation may potentially be harmed by their violations and resulting sanctions and fines.\nWe are subject to many environmental, health and safety regulations that may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities, which could reduce our profitability.\nOur operations and production facilities are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety laws and regulations at national, international and local levels in numerous jurisdictions relating to use of natural resources, pollution, protection of the environment, mine site remediation, transporting and storing raw materials and finished products, and storing and disposing of hazardous wastes among other materials.\nMoreover, certain environmental laws impose joint and several and/or strict liability for costs to clean up and restore sites where pollutants have been disposed or otherwise spilled or released. We are currently addressing certain areas of known contamination on our own properties, none of which we presently anticipate will result in any material costs or adverse impacts on our business or operations. However, we cannot be certain that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities for remediation or damage to property, natural resources or persons as a result of spills or releases from our operations or those of a third party.\nThe costs of compliance with the extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or the inability to obtain, update or renew permits required for operation or expansion of our business could reduce our results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. If we fail to comply with the conditions of our permits governing the production and management of regulated materials, mineral sands mining licenses or leases or the provisions of the applicable U.S., South African or Australian law, these permits, mining licenses or leases and mining rights could be canceled or suspended, and we could be prevented from obtaining new mining and prospecting rights, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, we could incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations, for violations arising under these laws and regulations. In the event of a catastrophic incident involving any of the raw materials we use, or chemicals or mineral products we produce, we could incur material costs as a result of addressing the consequences of such event.\nChanges to existing laws governing operations, especially changes in laws relating to transportation of mineral resources, the treatment of land and infrastructure, contaminated land, the remediation of mines, tax royalties, exchange control restrictions, environmental remediation, mineral rights, ownership of mining\nassets, or the rights to prospect and mine may have a material adverse effect on our future business operations and financial performance. There is risk that onerous conditions may be attached to authorizations in the form of mining rights, water-use licenses, miscellaneous licenses and environmental approvals, or that the grant of these approvals may be delayed or not granted.\nThe classification of TiO2 as a Category 2 Carcinogen in the European Union could result in more stringent regulatory control with respect to TiO2.\nIn May 2016, France\u2019s competent authority under the EU\u2019s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restrictions of Chemicals (\u201cREACH\u201d) submitted a proposal to the European Chemicals Agency (\u201cECHA\u201d) that would classify TiO2 as carcinogenic in humans by inhalation. On October 12, 2017, ECHA\u2019s Committee for Risk Assessment (\u201cRAC\u201d) released a written opinion dated September 14, 2017 stating that based on the scientific evidence it reviewed, there is sufficient grounds to classify TiO2 under the EU\u2019s Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation (\u201cCLP\u201d) as a Category 2 Carcinogen, but only with a hazard statement describing the risk by inhalation. After reviewing the RAC\u2019s formal recommendation on February 14, 2019, the European Commission was unable to reach a decision and will re-consider the proposal at its next meeting on March 7, 2019. If the European Commission ultimately decides to adopt this classification, it could require that products manufactured with TiO2 be classified as containing carcinogenic materials, which could impact our business by inhibiting the marketing of products containing TiO2 to consumers, and subject our manufacturing operations to new regulations that could increase costs. Any classification, use restriction or authorized requirement for use imposed by the ECHA could have additional effects under other EU laws (e.g., those affecting medical and pharmaceutical applications, cosmetics, food packaging and food additives) and/or trigger heightened regulatory scrutiny in countries and local jurisdictions outside the EU based on health and safety grounds. It is also possible that heightened regulatory scrutiny would lead to claims by consumers or those involved in the production of such products alleging adverse health impacts.\nWe may be subject to litigation, the disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe nature of our operations exposes us to possible litigation claims, including disputes with competitors, customers, equipment vendors, environmental groups and other non-governmental organizations, and providers of shipping services. Some of the lawsuits may seek fines or penalties and damages in large amounts, or seek to restrict our business activities. Because of the uncertain nature of any litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters or whether insurance claims may mitigate any damages to us. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe compete with other mining and chemical businesses for key human resources in the countries in which we operate, and our business will suffer if we are unable to hire highly skilled employees or if our key officers or employees discontinue employment with us.\nWe compete with other chemical and mining companies, and other companies generally, in the countries in which we operate to attract and retain key human resources at all levels with the appropriate technical skills and operating and managerial experience necessary to continue operating and expanding our businesses. These operations use modern techniques and equipment and accordingly require various types of skilled workers. The success of our business will be materially dependent upon the skills, experience and efforts of our key officers and skilled employees. Competition for skilled employees is particularly severe in Western Australia and at Namakwa Sands, which may cost us in terms of higher labor costs or reduced productivity. As a result, we may not be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees. Should we lose any of our key personnel or fail to attract and retain key qualified personnel or other skilled employees, our business may be harmed and our operational results and financial condition could be affected.\nIf we are unable to innovate and successfully introduce new products, or new technologies or processes reduce the demand for our products or the price at which we can sell products, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur industries and the end-use markets into which we sell our products experience periodic technological change and product improvement. Our future growth will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of commercial and technological progress in key end-use markets and on our ability to fund and successfully\ndevelop, manufacture and market products in such changing end-use markets. We must continue to identify, develop and market innovative products or enhance existing products on a timely basis to maintain our profit margins and our competitive position. If we fail to keep pace with any evolving technological innovations in our end-use markets on a competitive basis, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, new technologies or processes have the potential to replace or provide lower-cost alternatives to our products, such as new processes that reduce the amount of TiO2 or zircon content in consumer products which in turn could depress the demand and pricing for TiO2 or zircon, respectively. We cannot predict whether technological innovations will, in the future, result in a lower demand for our products or affect the competitiveness of our business. We may be required to invest significant resources to adapt to changing technologies, markets and competitive environments.\nThird parties may develop new intellectual property rights for processes and/or products that we would want to use, but would be unable to do so; or, third parties may claim that the products we make or the processes that we use infringe their intellectual property rights, which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages and/or prevent us from making, using or selling products we make or require alteration of the processes we use.\nResults of our operations may be negatively impacted if a competitor develops or has the right to use intellectual property rights for new processes or products and we cannot obtain similar rights on favorable terms or are unable to independently develop non-infringing competitive alternatives. Similarly, results of operations may also be negatively impacted if third parties assert that the products we make or made or the processes that we use or used infringe or infringed their intellectual property rights.\nAlthough there are currently no pending or threatened proceedings or claims known to us that are material relating to alleged infringement, misappropriation or violation of the intellectual property rights of others, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the future in which third parties allege that their patents or other intellectual property rights are infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated by us or our products or processes. In the event that any such infringement, misappropriation or violation of the intellectual property rights of others is found, we may need to obtain licenses from those parties or substantially re-engineer our products or processes to avoid such infringement, misappropriation or violation. We might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or be able to re-engineer our products or processes successfully. Moreover, if we are found by a court of law to infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, we could be required to pay substantial damages or be enjoined from making, using or selling the infringing products or technology. We also could be enjoined from making, using or selling the allegedly infringing products or technology pending the final outcome of the suit. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our intellectual property were compromised or copied by competitors, or if competitors were to develop similar intellectual property independently, our results of operations could be negatively affected.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property rights. Although we own and have applied for numerous patents and trademarks throughout the world, we may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights. Our patents and other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, and found unenforceable or otherwise compromised. A failure to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The protection afforded to our intellectual property varies based upon country, scope of individual patent or trademark, as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country.\nWe also rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, operational knowledge and other trade secrets to maintain our competitive position. While we maintain policies to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our proprietary expertise and other trade secrets, these agreements may not be enforceable or, even if legally enforceable, we may not have adequate remedies for breaches of such agreements. We also may not be able to readily detect breaches of such agreements. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means. The failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary technology, operational knowledge or trade secrets could result in significantly lower revenues, reduced profit margins or loss of market share.\nIn addition, we may be unable to determine when third parties are using our intellectual property rights without our authorization. The undetected or unremedied unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights or the legitimate development or acquisition of intellectual property related to our industry by third parties could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have as a result of our intellectual property rights, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. If we must take legal action to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights, any suits or proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and our management\u2019s attention, and we may not prevail in any such suits or proceedings. A failure to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ore resources and reserve estimates are based on a number of assumptions, including mining and recovery factors, future cash costs of production and ore demand and pricing. As a result, ore resources and reserve quantities actually produced may differ from current estimates.\nThe mineral resource and reserve estimates are estimates of the quantity and ore grades in our mines based on the interpretation of geological data obtained from drill holes and other sampling techniques, as well as from feasibility studies. The accuracy of these estimates is dependent on the assumptions and judgments made in interpreting the geological data. The assessment of geographical characteristics, such as location, quantity, quality, continuity of geology and grade, is made with varying degrees of confidence in accordance with established guidelines and standards. We use various exploration techniques, including geophysical surveys and sampling through drilling and trenching, to investigate resources and implement applicable quality assurance and quality control criteria to ensure that data is representative. Our mineral reserves represent the amount of ore that we believe can be economically mined and processed, and are estimated based on a number of factors, which have been stated in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7 (\u201cIndustry Guide 7\u201d), the South African Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 2007 version, as amended SAMREC and the Australian code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources the Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code (2012) (JORC).\nThere is significant uncertainty in any mineral reserve or mineral resource estimate. Factors that are beyond our control, such as the ability to secure mineral rights, the sufficiency of mineralization to support mining and beneficiation practices and the suitability of the market may significantly impact mineral resource and reserve estimates. The actual deposits encountered and the economic viability of mining a deposit may differ materially from our estimates. Since these mineral resources and reserves are estimates based on assumptions related to factors discussed above, we may revise these estimates in the future as we become aware of new developments. To maintain TiO2 feedstock and zircon production beyond the expected lives of our existing mines or to increase production materially above projected levels, we will need to access additional reserves through exploration or discovery.\nIf our intangible assets or other long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant noncash charge to earnings.\nWe have a significant amount of intangible assets and other long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), we review our intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets and other long-lived assets may not be recoverable, include, but are not limited to, a significant decline in share price and market capitalization, changes in the industries in which we operate, particularly the impact of a downturn in the global economy, as well as competition or other factors leading to reduction in expected long-term sales or results of operations. We may be required to record a significant noncash charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our intangible assets and other long-lived assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States, Australia and various other foreign jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. From time to time, the U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could\nresult in higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. From time to time, we are also subject to tax audits by various taxing authorities, Although we believe our tax positions are appropriate, the final determination of any future tax audits could be materially different from our income tax provisions, accruals and reserves and any such unfavorable outcome from a future tax audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThere may be difficulty in effecting service of legal process and enforcing judgments against us and our directors and management.\nWe are registered under the laws of Western Australia, Australia, and substantial portions of our assets are located outside of the U.S. In addition, certain members of our board of directors reside outside the U.S. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the U.S. upon Tronox Limited or such other persons residing outside the U.S., or to enforce judgments outside the U.S. obtained against such persons in U.S. courts in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce rights predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States. This will continue to be the case in the event of the consummation of the Re-Domicile Transaction.\nIn addition, assuming consummation of the Re-Domicile Transaction, we will be incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. The U.S. and the U.K. do not currently have a treaty providing for the recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. The enforceability of any judgment of a U.S. federal or state court in the U.K. will depend on the laws and any treaties in effect at the time, including conflicts of laws principles (such as those bearing on the question of whether a U.K. court would recognize the basis on which a U.S. court had purported to exercise jurisdiction over a defendant). In this context, there is doubt as to the enforceability in the U.K. of civil liabilities based solely on the federal securities laws of the U.S. In addition, awards for punitive damages in actions brought in the U.S. or elsewhere may be unenforceable in the U.K. An award for monetary damages under U.S. securities laws would likely be considered punitive if it did not seek to compensate the claimant for loss or damage suffered and was intended to punish the defendant.", "PERMNO": 91153, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "TROX"}
