Risk Factors\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nFrom time to time StanCorp or its representatives make written or oral statements, including some of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), press releases, conferences or otherwise, that are other than purely historical information. These statements, including statements about the proposed merger of StanCorp with Meiji Yasuda and estimates, projections, expected operating results, statements related to business plans, strategies, objectives and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d). Forward-looking statements also include, without limitation, any statement that includes words such as \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cseeks,\u201d \u201cwill be,\u201d \u201cwill continue,\u201d \u201cwill likely result\u201d and similar expressions that are predictive in nature or that depend on or refer to future events or conditions. Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve uncertainties that are difficult to predict. They involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties are detailed in reports filed by StanCorp with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, which may include, but are not limited to, the factors listed in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\n2015 ANNUAL REPORT 9\nPart I\nAs a provider of financial products and services, our actual results of operations may vary significantly in response to economic trends, interest rates, investment performance, claims experience, operating expenses and pricing. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a predictor of future results. We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements including annual guidance, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisk factors related to the proposed merger (the \u201cMerger\u201d) with Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance Company (\u201cMeiji Yasuda\u201d) are as follows:\n\u2022\nThe Merger is subject to various closing conditions-As disclosed in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 22-Proposed Merger with Meiji Yasuda,\u201d on July 23, 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (\u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with Meiji Yasuda and MYL Investments (Delaware) Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Meiji Yasuda. Completion of the Merger is subject to various closing conditions. On February 8, 2016, we informed the New York Stock Exchange that StanCorp and Meiji Yasuda have received all regulatory approvals for Meiji Yasuda\u2019s previously announced acquisition of StanCorp, and that the closing of the Merger is anticipated to occur on March 7, 2016, subject to the satisfaction of all necessary conditions to closing.\n\u2022\nFailure to timely complete the Merger could adversely impact our stock price, business, financial condition and results of operations-A failure to complete the Merger on a timely basis or at all could result in negative publicity and cause the price of our common stock to decline, in particular because our current stock price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will occur. In addition, as a result of the announcement of the Merger Agreement, trading in our stock has increased substantially. If the Merger is not consummated, the investment goals of our shareholders may be materially different than those of our shareholders on a pre-Merger announcement basis. In addition, we will remain liable for significant transaction costs that will be payable even if the Merger is not completed and could also be required to pay a termination fee to Meiji Yasuda in specific circumstances.\n\u2022\nThe pendency of the Merger and operating restrictions contained in the Merger Agreement could adversely affect our business and operations-The proposed Merger and certain interim operating covenants that govern the conduct of our business during the pendency of the Merger could cause disruptions to the Company\u2019s business and business relationships, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. For example, the attention of the Company\u2019s management may be directed to Merger-related considerations, the Company\u2019s current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Company, which may adversely affect our ability to retain and hire key personnel, and parties with which the Company has business relationships, including customers, potential customers and distributors, may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and seek alternative relationships or seek to alter their present business relationships with us in a manner that negatively impacts the Company.\n\u2022\nShareholder litigation against the Company, our directors and/or Meiji Yasuda could delay or prevent the Merger and cause us to incur significant costs and expenses-Transactions such as the Merger are often subject to lawsuits by shareholders. Conditions to the closing of the Merger require that no laws or legal restraints must have been adopted or in effect, and that no restraining order, injunction or other order, judgment, decision, opinion or decree must have been issued, in each case having the effect of making the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting the completion of the Merger. We cannot predict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss if these lawsuits or potential additional lawsuits are successful, or accurately estimate the costs associated with litigating or settling these lawsuits. For additional information regarding legal proceedings, see Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 19-Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nGeneral risk factors that may affect our business are as follows:\n\u2022\nOur reserves for future policy benefits and claims related to our current and future business may prove to be inadequate-For certain of our product lines, we establish and carry, as a liability, actuarially determined reserves to meet our obligations for future policy benefits and claims. These reserves do not represent an exact calculation of our future benefit liabilities but instead are estimates based on assumptions, which can be materially affected by changes in the economy, changes in social perceptions about work ethics, emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability, emerging or changing health issues and changes in industry regulation. Claims experience on our products can fluctuate widely from period to period. If actual events vary materially from our assumptions used when establishing the reserves to meet our obligations for future policy benefits and claims, we may be required to increase our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n10 STANCORP FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.\n\u2022\nDifferences between actual claims experience and underwriting and reserving assumptions may adversely affect our financial results-Our long term disability insurance products provide coverage for claims incurred during the policy period. Generally, group policies offer rate guarantees for periods from one to three years. While we can prospectively re-price and re-underwrite coverages at the end of these guarantee periods, we must pay benefits with respect to claims incurred during these periods without being able to increase guaranteed premium rates during these periods. Longer duration claims, in addition to a higher volume of claims than we expect, expose us to the possibility that we may pay benefits in excess of the amount that we anticipated when the policy was underwritten. The profitability of our long term disability insurance products is thus subject to volatility resulting from the difference between our actual claims experience and our assumptions at the time of underwriting.\n\u2022\nWe are exposed to concentration risk on our group life insurance business-Due to the nature of group life insurance coverage, we are subject to geographical concentration risk from the occurrence of a catastrophe.\n\u2022\nWe may be exposed to disintermediation risk during periods of increasing interest rates-In periods of increasing interest rates, withdrawals of group and individual annuity contracts may increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns. This process, referred to as disintermediation, may lead to net cash outflows. These outflows may require investment assets to be sold at a time when the prices of those assets are adversely affected by the increase in interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses. A significant portion of our investment portfolio consists of commercial mortgage loans, which are relatively illiquid, thus increasing our liquidity risk in the event of disintermediation during a period of rising interest rates.\n\u2022\nOur profitability may be adversely affected by declining or low interest rates-During periods of declining or low interest rates, annuity products may be relatively more attractive investments, resulting in increases in the percentage of policies remaining in-force from year to year during a period when our new investments carry lower returns. During these periods, actual returns on our investments could prove inadequate for us to meet contractually guaranteed minimum payments to holders of our annuity products. In addition, the profitability of our life and disability insurance products can be affected by declining or low interest rates. A factor in pricing our insurance products is prevailing interest rates. Longer duration claims and premium rate guarantees can expose us to interest rate risk when portfolio yields are less than those assumed when pricing these products. Commercial mortgage loans and fixed maturity securities-available-for-sale (\u201cfixed maturity securities\u201d) in our investment portfolio are more likely to be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates, and we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower interest-bearing investments.\n\u2022\nOur investment portfolio is subject to risks of market value fluctuations, defaults, delinquencies and liquidity-Our general account investments primarily consist of fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage loans and tax-advantaged investments. The fair values of our investments vary with changing economic and market conditions and interest rates. In addition, we are subject to default risk on our fixed maturity securities portfolio and its corresponding impact on credit spreads. Our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is subject to delinquency, default and borrower concentration risks. Related declines in market activity due to overall declining values of fixed maturity securities may result in our fixed maturity securities portfolio becoming less liquid. In addition, our commercial mortgage loans are relatively illiquid and the demand for our real estate acquired in satisfaction of debt through foreclosure or acceptance of deeds in lieu of foreclosure on commercial mortgage loans (\u201cReal Estate Owned\u201d) may remain low due to macroeconomic conditions. We may have difficulty selling our fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage loans and Real Estate Owned at attractive prices, in a timely manner, or both if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice. Substantially all of our tax-advantaged investments and related tax credits are related to development projects that are subject to ongoing compliance requirements over certain periods of time to fully realize their value. If these projects are not operated in full compliance with the required terms, the tax credits could be subject to recapture or restructuring. Declines in the value of our invested assets could also affect our ability to pledge collateral as required.\n\u2022\nOur business is subject to significant competition-Each of our business segments faces competition from other insurers and financial services companies, such as banks, broker-dealers, mutual funds, and managed care providers for employer groups, individual consumers and distributors. Since many of our competitors have greater financial resources, offer a broader array of products and, with respect to other insurers, may have higher financial strength ratings than we do, the possibility exists that any one of our business segments could be adversely affected by competition, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\u2022\nA downgrade in our financial strength ratings may negatively affect our business-Financial strength ratings, which are an indicator of our claims paying ability, are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our company and in our ability to market our products. Rating organizations regularly review the financial performance and condition of insurance companies, including our company. A ratings downgrade could increase our surrender levels for our annuity products, could adversely affect our ability to market our products, could increase costs of future debt issuances, and could thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n2015 ANNUAL REPORT 11\nPart I\n\u2022\nOur profitability may be affected by changes in state and federal regulation-Our business is subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision throughout the United States including rules and regulations relating to income taxes and accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While we cannot predict the impact of potential or future state or federal legislation or regulation on our business, future laws and regulations, or the interpretation thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\u2022\nOur deferred tax assets include net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d), which depend on future taxable income to be realized and may be limited or impaired by future ownership changes-Our deferred tax assets include federal, state and local NOLs. Certain of our subsidiaries as a group have generated losses in recent years. NOLs can be available to reduce income taxes that might otherwise be incurred on future taxable income. There can be no assurance that we will generate the future taxable income necessary to utilize our NOLs. Furthermore, the availability of these losses to be utilized in the future can become limited if certain changes in company structure or income levels occur. In such a circumstance, we may be unable to utilize the losses even if the Company generates future taxable income.\n\u2022\nOur business is subject to litigation risk-In the normal course of business, we are a plaintiff or defendant in actions arising out of our insurance business and investment operations. We are from time to time involved in various governmental and administrative proceedings. While the outcome of any pending or future litigation cannot be predicted, as of the date hereof, we do not believe that any pending litigation will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. However, no assurances can be given that such litigation would not materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\u2022\nWe may be exposed to environmental liability from our commercial mortgage loan and real estate investments-As a commercial mortgage lender, we customarily conduct environmental assessments prior to originating commercial mortgage loans secured by real estate and before taking title through foreclosure or deeds in lieu of foreclosure to real estate collateralizing delinquent commercial mortgage loans held by us. Compliance costs associated with environmental laws and regulations or any remediation of affected properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\n\u2022\nCertain concentrations in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio may subject us to losses-Concentration of borrowers and tenants in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio may expose us to potential losses resulting from a downturn in the economy, business performance of tenants, or adverse changes in a borrower\u2019s financial condition. Although we diversify our commercial mortgage loan portfolio by location, type of property, borrower and tenants, such diversification may not eliminate the risk of such losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\u2022\nThe concentration of our investments in California may subject us to losses resulting from an economic downturn-Our commercial mortgage loans are concentrated in the western region of the U.S., particularly in California. Currently, our California exposure is primarily in Los Angeles County, Orange County, San Diego County and the Bay Area Counties. We have a smaller concentration of commercial mortgage loans in the Inland Empire and the San Joaquin Valley where there has historically been greater economic decline. A decline in economic conditions in California could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\u2022\nThe concentration of our investments in the western region of the U.S. may subject us to losses resulting from certain natural catastrophes in this area-Due to our commercial mortgage loan concentration in the western region of the U.S., particularly in California, we are exposed to potential losses resulting from certain natural catastrophes, such as earthquakes and fires, which may affect the region. Although we require borrowers to maintain fire insurance, consider the potential for earthquake loss based upon specific information to each property and diversify our commercial mortgage loan portfolio within the western region by both location and type of property in an effort to reduce earthquake exposure, such diversification may not eliminate the risk of such losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\u2022\nCatastrophe losses from a disease pandemic could have an adverse effect on us-Our life insurance operations are exposed to the risk of loss from an occurrence of catastrophic mortality caused by a disease pandemic, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\u2022\nCatastrophe losses from terrorism or other factors could have an adverse effect on us-An occurrence of a significant catastrophic event, including terrorism, natural or other disasters, or a change in the nature and availability of or continuation of existing reinsurance and catastrophe reinsurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or capital levels.\n\u2022\nAs a holding company, we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in sufficient amounts to pay dividends to shareholders, make payments on debt securities and meet our other obligations-We are a holding company for our insurance and asset management subsidiaries as well as for the subsidiaries that comprise our Other category and do not have any significant operations of our own. Dividends and permitted payments from our subsidiaries are our principal source of cash to pay dividends to shareholders, make payments on debt securities and meet our other\n12 STANCORP FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.\nobligations. As a result, our ability to pay dividends to shareholders and interest payments on debt securities will primarily depend upon the receipt of dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries.\nMany of our subsidiaries are non-insurance businesses with the exception of StanCorp Equities, a limited business broker-detail and member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority have no regulatory restrictions on dividends. Our insurance subsidiaries, however, are regulated by insurance laws and regulations that limit the maximum amount of dividends, distributions and other payments that they could declare and pay to us without prior approval of the states in which the subsidiaries are domiciled. Under Oregon law, Standard Insurance Company may pay dividends only from the earned surplus arising from its business. Oregon law gives the Director of the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services-Division of Financial Regulation (\u201cOregon Insurance Division\u201d) broad discretion regarding the approval of dividends in excess of certain statutory limitations. Oregon law requires us to receive the prior approval of the Oregon Insurance Division to pay such a dividend. See Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Capital Management-Dividends from Standard.\u201d\n\u2022\nOur ability to refinance debt and raise capital in future years depends not only on contributions from our subsidiaries but also on market conditions and availability of credit in the market-We do not have any significant debt maturities in the near term. Our 10-year senior notes of $250 million will mature in August 2022, and our junior subordinated debentures of $252.9 million will mature in 2067 with a call option in 2017. We maintain a $250 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (\u201cFacility\u201d) for general corporate purposes. Upon our request and with consent of the lenders under the Facility, the Facility can be increased to $350 million. The termination date of the Facility is June 22, 2018. We issued a letter of credit which reduced the available balance by $1.0 million on the Facility at December 31, 2015. The Facility is composed of a syndication of seven banks. Commitments from the banks toward the available line of credit range from $15.0 million to $60.0 million per bank. If a bank from this syndication defaults, the available line of credit would be reduced by that bank\u2019s commitment toward the line. On October 27, 2015, we amended the Facility to change the definition of change in control to allow for the proposed merger with Meiji Yasuda.\n\u2022\nOur portfolio of investments, including U.S. government and agency bonds and U.S. state and political subdivision bonds could be negatively impacted by U.S. credit and financial market conditions-A potential ratings downgrade of U.S. government securities could lead to future deterioration in the U.S. and global credit and financial markets. As a result, these events may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nOur profitability may be adversely affected by a decline in equity and debt markets-U.S. and global equity markets heavily influence the value of our retirement plan assets under administration, which are a significant component from which our administrative fee revenues are derived. A decline in equity and debt markets could result in decreases in the value of the assets under administration in our retirement plans, which could reduce our ability to earn administrative fee revenues derived from the value of those assets.\n\u2022\nA decline in equity and debt markets and low interest rates could affect the funding status of Company sponsored pension plans-Our estimates of liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the estimated future liability, the long-term rate of return on plan assets, inflation rates, mortality rates, and the employee workforce. Changes in the discount rate, inflation rates, mortality rates, or the rate of return on plan assets resulting from economic downturns could increase our required cash contributions or pension-related expenses in future periods. The funding status of the Company\u2019s pension plans is evaluated annually during the fourth quarter.\n\u2022\nOur ability to conduct business may be compromised if we are unable to maintain the availability of our systems and safeguard the security of our data in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated events-We use computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer and company data and information. Our business is highly dependent on our ability to access these systems to perform necessary business functions. System failures, system outages, outsourcing risk or the failure or unwillingness of a service provider to perform could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner and could hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, fire, a blackout, a computer virus, a terrorist attack or war, these systems may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time. These systems could also be subject to physical and electronic break-ins and subject to similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering. This may impede or interrupt our business operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\u2022\nOngoing weakness and financial market uncertainty could continue to adversely affect us in the near term-Economic downturns and disruptions in the global financial market present risks and uncertainties. During an economic downturn, we face the following risks:\n\u2022\nDeclines in revenues or profitability as a result of lost wages or lower levels of insured employees by our customers due to reductions in workforce. Additionally, revenues and profitability could decline as a result of lower levels of assets under administration.\n2015 ANNUAL REPORT 13\nPart I\n\u2022\nIncreases in pricing pressure and competition resulting in a loss of customers or new business as customers seek to reduce benefit costs and competitors seek to protect market share.\n\u2022\nA declining or a continued low interest rate environment and its effect on product pricing and the reserves we must carry.\n\u2022\nIncreases in commercial mortgage loan foreclosures.\n\u2022\nIncreases in holdings of Real Estate Owned properties due to a decline in demand for these properties and the decline in value of these properties during our holding period.\n\u2022\nContinued pressure on budgets for public institutions could impact the employment and wage levels of our customer groups in this sector, which represents a significant customer group for our employee benefits business, which may have an adverse effect on our premium levels for our group businesses and revenues for our retirement plans business.\n\u2022\nIncreases in corporate tax rates to finance government-spending programs.\n\u2022\nReductions in the number of our potential lenders or to our committed credit availability due to combinations or failures of financial institutions.\n\u2022\nLoss of employer groups due to business acquisitions, bankruptcy or failure.\n\u2022\nDeclines in the financial health of reinsurers.\n\u2022\nReduction in the value of our general account investment portfolio.\n\u2022\nDeclines in revenues and profitability as a result of lower levels of assets under administration.", "PERMNO": 86809, "SIC": 6321, "TIC": "SFG"}
