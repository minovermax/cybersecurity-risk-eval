{"cik": "1337553", "company": "AERIE PHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in an industry that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Other risks and uncertainties, including those that we do not currently consider material, may impair our business. If any of the risks discussed below actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization\nWe depend substantially on the success of our products, Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae. If we are unable to successfully commercialize Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nOur business and the ability to generate revenue related to product sales depend on the successful commercialization of our products Rhopressa\u00ae, which began in April 2018, and Rocklatan\u00ae, which began in May 2019, and the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of any current or future product candidates for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma, dry eye, retinal diseases and potentially other diseases of the eye. Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae have been approved by the FDA in the United States, and the EC has granted a centralised marketing authorisation for Rhopressa\u00ae for the EU (where it will be marketed as Rhokiinsa\u00ae), but they have not received regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction and no sales can be made in any such jurisdiction unless such approval occurs. We have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae, and our prospects are highly dependent on, and a significant portion of the value of our company relates to, our ability to successfully commercialize these products. The success of Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae and any current or future product candidates depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully completing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nreceiving and maintaining regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ndeveloping and maintaining effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022\nestablishing adequate internal manufacturing capacity or arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022\nobtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity;\n\u2022\nestablishing commercial markets;\n\u2022\nobtaining coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers; and\n\u2022\nsuccessfully competing with other products.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, which could materially harm our business, and we may not be able to earn sufficient revenues and cash flows to continue our operations.\nThe commercial success of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any current or future product candidates, if approved, will depend on the degree of market acceptance among eye-care professionals, patients, patient advocacy groups, healthcare payers and the medical community.\nCommercial activities began in the United States in April 2018 for Rhopressa\u00ae and in May 2019 for Rocklatan\u00ae. Our sales force is working to gain market acceptance among eye-care professionals, patients, patient advocacy groups, healthcare payers, including pharmacy benefit managers, and the medical community. The commercial success of these products in the United States will depend on the degree of such market acceptance. Similarly, if Rhopressa\u00ae is approved in jurisdictions outside the United States and the EU, if Rocklatan\u00ae is approved in any jurisdictions outside the United States and any current or future product candidates are approved in any jurisdiction in which they may receive approval, those products may not gain market acceptance among eye-care professionals, patients, patient advocacy groups, healthcare payers, including pharmacy benefit managers, and the medical community in such jurisdictions. There are a number of available therapies marketed for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma, dry eye, retinal diseases and potentially other diseases of the eye. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, but most others, including latanoprost and many beta blockers, in the case of glaucoma treatment, are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by eye-care professionals, patients and third-party payers. Insurers and other third-party payers may also encourage the use of generic products, either in preference to or prior to the use of brand therapies. The degree of market acceptance of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any current or future product candidates, if approved, will depend on a number\nof factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe market price, affordability and patient out-of-pocket costs, relative to other available products, which are predominantly generics;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that third-party payers will not give favorable positions on their formularies or will place restrictions on their use, including through use of step therapy or prior authorization programs;\n\u2022\nthe timing of market introduction;\n\u2022\ntheir effectiveness as compared with currently available products, including eye drops and other technologies such as sustained-release inserts and devices;\n\u2022\neye-care professional willingness to prescribe and patient willingness to adopt them in place of current therapies;\n\u2022\nvarying patient characteristics including demographic factors such as age, health, race and economic status;\n\u2022\nchanges in the standard of care for the targeted indications;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in labeling;\n\u2022\nlimitations in the approved clinical indications and MOA(s);\n\u2022\nour success in demonstrating their benefits including relative convenience and ease of initiation, prescription and administration;\n\u2022\nthe strength of our selling, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022\nthe quality of our relationships with eye-care professionals, patient advocacy groups, third-party payers and the medical community;\n\u2022\nthe continuous availability of quality manufactured products;\n\u2022\nsufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement; and\n\u2022\nthe degree to which the products are subject to material product liability claims.\nAs we have done with Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae, it is possible that we may find it necessary or desirable to provide rebates on current or future product candidates, if approved, to customers or third-party payers or to implement patient assistance programs, including co-pay assistance programs, which could affect our profitability. In addition, we do not know how eye-care professionals, patients and third-party payers will continue to respond to the pricing of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae in the United States or how they will respond to their pricing in jurisdictions outside the United States, or the pricing of any current or future product candidates in any jurisdiction, if approved.\nThe market opportunities for our currently marketed or potential products, if approved, are difficult to precisely estimate. Our estimates of these market opportunities in the United States, the potential market opportunity for Rhokiinsa\u00ae in the EC and the potential market opportunity in jurisdictions outside the United States for any current or future product candidates, if approved, include several key assumptions based on our industry knowledge, industry publications, third-party research reports and other surveys. For example, the Mercury 3 results for Roclanda\u00ae are expected to be an important determinant as we evaluate the commercialization and profitability potential of Rhokiinsa\u00ae and Roclanda\u00ae in Europe. While we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable, independent sources have not verified all of our assumptions. If any of these assumptions prove to be inaccurate and the actual market for any of our products post-regulatory approval is smaller than we expect or if we fail to maintain market acceptance or fail to achieve market acceptance, our potential product revenue may be limited, and it may be more difficult for us to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIf we fail to obtain and sustain an adequate level of coverage and reimbursement for Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, if approved, by third-party payers, potential future sales would be materially adversely affected.\nThe course of treatment for patients with open-angle glaucoma, dry eye, retinal diseases and other diseases of the eye includes primarily older drugs, and the leading products for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma, dry eye, retinal diseases and other diseases of the eye currently in the market, including latanoprost and timolol, in the case of glaucoma treatment, are available as generic drugs. Therefore, there will be no commercially viable market for Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, if approved, without adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and any\nreimbursement policy may be affected by future healthcare reform measures. We have obtained formulary coverage for the majority of lives covered under commercial plans and Medicare Part D plans for Rhopressa\u00ae in the United States and are gaining incremental coverage for Rocklatan\u00ae. We cannot be certain that those levels of coverage will continue to increase, or that we will be able to maintain those levels of coverage. Further, we cannot be certain that adequate coverage and reimbursement will be available for either of our products in jurisdictions outside the United States or for any current or future product candidates, if approved. Additionally, even if there is a commercially viable market, if the level of coverage or reimbursement is below our expectations, our anticipated revenue and gross margins will be adversely affected.\nThird-party payers, such as government or private healthcare insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, carefully review and increasingly question and challenge the coverage of and the prices charged for drugs. Reimbursement rates from private health insurance companies vary depending on the company, the insurance plan and other factors. Reimbursement rates may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. A current trend in the United States healthcare industry is toward cost containment. Large public and private payers, managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations and similar organizations are exerting increasing influence on decisions regarding the use of, and reimbursement levels for, particular treatments. Such third-party payers, including Medicare, may question the coverage of, and challenge the prices charged for, medical products and services, and many third-party payers limit coverage of or reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products. In particular, third-party payers may limit the covered indications. Cost-control initiatives in the U.S. healthcare industry could decrease the price we have established for Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, if approved, which could result in product revenues being lower than anticipated. Our products are currently priced higher than existing generic drugs and consistently with current branded drugs. If we are unable to show a significant benefit relative to existing generic drugs, Medicare, Medicaid and private payers may not be willing to reimburse for Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, if approved, which would significantly reduce the likelihood of them gaining market acceptance. Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted.\nWe believe that U.S. third-party payers consider the efficacy, cost effectiveness, safety and tolerability of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and will consider such factors of any current or future product candidates, if approved, and whether use of any such products should be a covered benefit under its health plan in determining whether to approve coverage and reimbursement for such products and at what level. Obtaining these approvals can be a time consuming and expensive process. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we do not maintain approval for reimbursement of Rhopressa\u00ae or we do not receive approval for reimbursement of Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, if approved, from third-party payers on a timely or satisfactory basis or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels. Limitations on coverage could also be imposed at the local Medicare carrier level or by fiscal intermediaries. Medicare Part D, which provides a pharmacy benefit to Medicare patients as discussed below, does not require participating prescription drug plans to cover all drugs within a class of products. Our business could be materially adversely affected if Part D prescription drug plans were to limit access to or deny or limit reimbursement of any of our approved products.\nReimbursement in the EU must be negotiated on a country-by-country basis and in many countries the product cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved. The negotiation process in some countries can exceed 12 months. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of any of our products, if approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities, to other available therapies. If the prices for any of our products, if approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities, decrease or if governmental and other third-party payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels, our revenue, potential for future cash flows and prospects for profitability will suffer. Also, we may not be able to launch the product uniformly throughout the EU but may have to commence commercial operations on a country-by-country basis, which could complicate the launching process and negatively affect our sales.\nWe face competition from established branded and generic pharmaceutical companies and if our competitors are able to develop and market products that are preferred over our products, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition from established branded and generic pharmaceutical companies and smaller biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, which may in the future develop products to treat patients with open-angle glaucoma, dry eye, retinal diseases and other diseases of the eye. We currently compete directly against companies producing existing and future glaucoma treatment products. To the extent we develop proprietary compounds for use beyond glaucoma, we will face competition from companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions operating in such new therapeutic areas.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Early-stage companies are also developing treatments for open-angle glaucoma, dry eye, retinal diseases and other diseases of the eye and may prove to be significant competitors. In September 2018, Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. received FDA approval for a PGA indicated for the reduction of IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. We expect that our competitors will continue to develop new treatments for open-angle glaucoma, dry eye, retinal diseases and other diseases of the eye, which may include eye drops, oral treatments, surgical procedures, implantable devices or laser treatments. Alternative treatments beyond eye drops continue to develop. For example, although surgical procedures are currently used in severe cases, less invasive procedures are currently under development and we expect that we will compete with other companies that develop implantable devices or other products or procedures for use in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma, dry eye, retinal diseases and other diseases of the eye.\nOther early-stage companies may also compete through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer adverse effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. In addition, competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours.\nIn addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in many cases insurers or other third-party payers encourage the use of generic products. Ophthalmology is currently dominated by generic drugs, such as latanoprost and timolol, in the case of glaucoma treatment, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. Our current products are priced at a premium over competitive generic products and consistent with other branded glaucoma drugs. Our ability to compete effectively will depend upon, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully complete clinical trials and obtain all requisite regulatory approvals in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u2022\nobtain and maintain patent protection and non-patent exclusivity in all current and potential commercial jurisdictions for our products;\n\u2022\nattract and retain key personnel;\n\u2022\ndevelop effective manufacturing capabilities in our manufacturing plant in Athlone, Ireland, and continue to build an effective selling and marketing infrastructure;\n\u2022\ndemonstrate the advantages of our products compared to alternative therapies, including, in the case of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae, other currently marketed PGA and non-PGA products;\n\u2022\nidentify and develop additional product candidates to expand our current product portfolio;\n\u2022\ncompete against other products with fewer contraindications; and\n\u2022\nobtain and sustain adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.\nIf our competitors market products that are more effective, safer, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than our products or that reach the market sooner than any of our current or future product candidates, if approved, we may not achieve commercial success.\nIf we are unable to establish a direct sales force in jurisdictions outside the United States, our business may be harmed.\nWe have no experience selling, marketing or distributing any drug product in any jurisdictions outside the United States, and we currently are evaluating a commercially-oriented presence in jurisdictions outside the United States. Other companies have experienced unsuccessful product launches and failed to meet expectations of market potential, including companies with significantly more experience and resources than us, and there can be no guarantee that we will successfully launch any product in any jurisdictions outside the United States. To achieve commercial success for our products in jurisdictions outside the United States, we must either develop a sales and marketing organization in such jurisdictions or outsource these functions to third parties. We are currently evaluating the commercialization and profit potential of Rhokiinsa\u00ae and Roclanda\u00ae in Europe and expect to partner for Japan. If we do pursue a direct sales and marketing strategy in a jurisdiction, we would incur significant additional expenses and commit significant additional time and management resources if we were to establish and train a sales force to market and sell our products in jurisdictions outside the United States. We may not be able to successfully establish these capabilities on our expected timing or at all despite these additional expenditures.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to successfully establish a sales force in jurisdictions outside the United States include:\n\u2022\nan inability to compete with other pharmaceutical companies to recruit, hire, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel with requisite knowledge of our target market;\n\u2022\nan inability to effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing organization in such jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to adequate numbers of eye-care professionals to prescribe any future approved products;\n\u2022\nfailure to adhere to regulatory requirements governing the sale of products in any jurisdiction;\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization; and\n\u2022\na delay in bringing products to market after efforts to hire and train our sales force have already commenced.\nIn the event we are unable to successfully market and promote our products, our business may be harmed.\nOutside the United States, we have only obtained regulatory approval for Rhopressa\u00ae in Europe and have not obtained regulatory approval outside the United States for Rocklatan\u00ae.\nRhopressa\u00ae has received regulatory approval in the United States and the EU and Rocklatan\u00ae has received regulatory approval in the United States. We do not yet have any products that have received regulatory approval in any jurisdictions outside the United States and the EU. We cannot guarantee that we will ever have any other marketable products. Our business is substantially dependent on our ability to complete the development of, obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize product candidates in a timely manner. We cannot commercialize product candidates in the United States without first obtaining regulatory approval to market each product from the FDA and cannot commercialize product candidates in the EU without first obtaining regulatory approval to market each product; similarly, we cannot commercialize product candidates outside of the United States and the EU without obtaining regulatory approval from comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nWith respect to approval of Rhopressa\u00ae outside the United States, in the fourth quarter of 2019, the EC granted a centralised marketing authorisation. Rhopressa\u00ae will be marketed under the name Rhokiinsa\u00ae in the EC. With respect to the clinical progress of Rhopressa\u00ae in Japan, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial, a successful pilot Phase 2 clinical study in the United States on Japanese and Japanese-American subjects, as well as a successful Phase 2 clinical trial conducted in Japan. These studies were designed to meet the requirements of Japan\u2019s PMDA for potential regulatory submission of Rhopressa\u00ae in Japan. Topline results of the Phase 2 trial indicated positive efficacy and tolerability in the patient set. We expect to move forward with plans for Phase 3 initiation in Japan for Rhopressa\u00ae.\nWe cannot predict how long it will take to obtain approval in Japan and whether our clinical trials ultimately will be successful. We will need to ensure that all clinical trials in Japan comply with all applicable regulations. Any failure to fully comply with Japanese regulations could result in the regulatory authorities requesting corrections or requiring new clinical trials be conducted, which could cause delay in obtaining the approval.\nWith regard to Rocklatan\u00ae in jurisdictions outside the United States, in December 2019, the EMA accepted our MAA for Rocklatan\u00ae, which will be marketed under the name Roclanda\u00ae in the EU, if approved. In addition, we initiated a third Phase 3 registration trial for Roclanda\u00ae, named Mercury 3. Mercury 3 is not required for regulatory approval, but, if successful, is expected to improve our commercialization prospects in the EU. The Mercury 3 results are expected to be an important determinant as we evaluate the commercialization and profitability potential of Rhokiinsa\u00ae and Roclanda\u00ae in Europe. Clinical trials for Rocklatan\u00ae have not yet begun in Japan.\nWe cannot predict whether ongoing trials and future trials will be successful or whether regulators will agree with our conclusions regarding the preclinical studies and clinical trials we have conducted to date. FDA approval of any of our products does not constitute assurance that we will receive FDA approval for any current or future product candidates. Likewise, the EC grant of a centralised marketing authorisation for Rhokiinsa\u00ae and EMA acceptance of our MAA for Roclanda\u00ae do not constitute regulatory approval of Roclanda\u00ae in the EU, and there can be no assurance that we will receive regulatory approval for any of our products in jurisdictions outside the United States and the EU.\nRegulatory authorities outside of the United States, such as in Europe and Japan and in emerging markets, have specific requirements for approval of drugs for commercial sale with which we must comply prior to marketing in those areas. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our product candidates. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and\nobtaining regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could require additional non-clinical studies or clinical trials, which could be costly and time consuming. For all of these reasons, we may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all.\nThe process to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize product candidates is long, complex and costly both inside and outside of the United States, and approval is never guaranteed. Even if Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae, Rhokiinsa\u00ae, Roclanda\u00ae and any current or future product candidates were to successfully obtain approval from the regulatory authorities, any approval might significantly limit the approved indications for use, or require that precautions, contraindications, or warnings be included on the product labeling, or require expensive and time-consuming post-approval clinical studies or surveillance as conditions of approval. Following any approval for commercial sale of any products we may develop, certain changes to the product, such as changes in manufacturing processes and additional labeling claims, will be subject to additional review and approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Also, regulatory approval for Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae, Rhokiinsa\u00ae, Roclanda\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, if approved, may be withdrawn. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for Rhopressa\u00ae outside the United States and the EU, for Rocklatan\u00ae outside the United States or any current or future product candidates in one or more jurisdictions, or any approval contains significant limitations, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue and cash flows to continue the development of any other product candidate in the future.\nRegulatory approval may be substantially delayed or may not be obtained for our products in jurisdictions outside the United States or for any current or future product candidates in any jurisdiction if regulatory authorities require additional time or studies to assess the safety and efficacy.\nWe may be unable to initiate or complete development of our products in jurisdictions outside the United States on schedule, if at all. If applicable regulatory authorities require additional time or studies to assess the safety or efficacy of any of our products or current or future product candidates, we may require funding beyond the amounts currently on our balance sheet. In addition, in the event of any unforeseen costs or other business decisions, we may not have or be able to obtain adequate funding to complete the necessary steps for approval of any of our products or current or future product candidates. Preclinical studies and clinical trials required to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of drug products are time consuming and expensive and together take several years or more to complete. Delays in regulatory approvals or rejections of applications for regulatory approval in the United States, Europe, Japan or other markets may result from many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain sufficient funds required for a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nregulatory requests for additional analyses, reports, data, non-clinical and preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nregulatory questions regarding interpretations of data and results and the emergence of new information regarding product candidates or other products;\n\u2022\nclinical holds, other regulatory objections to commencing or continuing a clinical trial or the inability to obtain regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial in countries that require such approvals;\n\u2022\nfailure to reach agreement with the applicable regulators regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour inability to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u2022\nunfavorable or inconclusive results of clinical trials and supportive non-clinical studies, including unfavorable results regarding the effectiveness or safety of product candidates during clinical trials;\n\u2022\nany determination that a clinical trial or product candidate presents unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial due to unforeseen costs or other business decisions;\n\u2022\nour inability to reach agreements on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\nour inability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for the same indications targeted by any of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain approval from IRBs to conduct clinical trials at their respective sites;\n\u2022\nthe failure of a third party to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including site inspections and inspection readiness;\n\u2022\nour inability to timely manufacture or obtain from third parties sufficient quantities or quality of the product candidate or other materials required for a clinical trial; and\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance may also occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols submitted to applicable regulatory authorities to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies with respect to our product candidates beyond those that are initially contemplated, if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other studies or if the results of these studies are not positive or are only modestly positive, we may be delayed in obtaining regulatory approval for that product candidate, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval at all or we may obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as intended. Our product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals and we may not have sufficient funding to complete the testing and approval process. Significant clinical trial delays could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our products if and when approved. If any of this occurs, our business will be materially harmed.\nThe UK left the EU as of January 31, 2020, with a transitional period up to December 31, 2020. As one of the Brexit consequences, the EMA has relocated from London to Amsterdam. This has led to a significant reduction of the EMA workforce, which has resulted in significant delays in its administrative procedures. Pursuant to the Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and the UK, the UK and the EU member states will share with each other marketing authorization dossiers pending at the end of the transition period, i.e. up to December 31, 2020, to enable review by the other in accordance with respective regulation. This procedure may apply to Roclanda\u00ae if our MAA is still pending as of that date. The UK MHRA has issued guidance to the effect that pharmaceuticals having an EU centralised marketing authorisation as of the UK withdrawal date, i.e. on January 31, 2020, will be grandfathered in the UK and, subject to the completion of an administrative process, such EU centralised marketing authorisation will be converted by the MHRA into a national UK product license. Therefore, we expect that Rhokiinsa\u00ae will continue to be authorised in the UK. Whether or not such grandfathering will apply for Roclanda\u00ae is unclear and may depend on how fast we can receive an EU marketing authorisation, if at all.\nIf Brexit results in market access delays in Europe or the requirement for additional marketing approvals, our business may be materially harmed.\nThe failure by the U.S. Congress to timely approve a budget for the federal government and its agencies, including the FDA, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOn an annual basis, the U.S. Congress must approve budgets that govern spending by the federal agencies, including the FDA. If Congress cannot agree on a budget, or if the President vetoes a budget approved by Congress, then the federal government may be shut down and non-essential federal employees, including many FDA employees, may be furloughed. Such a shutdown would prevent the FDA from performing many of its duties, which are crucial to our business. For example, on December 22, 2018, due to a lapse in appropriations for the federal government, most of the federal government was shut down, including many functions of the FDA, and most federal employees were furloughed for several weeks. Any future government shutdown could affect, among other things, the FDA approval process of one or more of our current or future product candidates, or the ability of the FDA to inspect a manufacturing facility supporting our business, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure can occur at any stage of clinical development. If the clinical trials are unsuccessful, we could be required to abandon development.\nA failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing for a variety of reasons. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the outcome of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. In addition, adverse events may occur or other risks may be discovered in Phase 3 registration trials that may cause us to suspend or terminate our clinical trials. In some instances, there can be significant\nvariability in safety and/or efficacy results between different trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in or adherence to trial protocols, differences in size and type of the patient populations and the rates of dropout among clinical trial participants. Our future clinical trial results therefore may not demonstrate safety and efficacy sufficient to obtain regulatory approval for Rhopressa\u00ae in jurisdictions outside the United States and the EU and Rocklatan\u00ae in jurisdictions outside the United States or for any current or future product candidates in any jurisdiction.\nFlaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well-advanced or after data results have been obtained. We have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute clinical trials to support regulatory approval. In addition, clinical trials often reveal that it is not practical or feasible to continue development efforts.\nWe may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to participants. Further, regulatory agencies, IRBs or data safety monitoring boards may at any time order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials or request that we cease using investigators in the clinical trials if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. Since our inception, we have not voluntarily or involuntarily suspended or terminated a clinical trial due to unacceptable safety risks to participants.\nIf the results of any of our clinical trials do not achieve the primary efficacy endpoints or demonstrate unexpected safety issues, the prospects for approval of our product candidates will be materially adversely affected. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations, analyses and entry criteria, and many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have failed to achieve similar results in later clinical trials, including longer term trials, or have failed to obtain regulatory approval of their product candidates. Many compounds that initially showed promise in clinical trials or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause undesirable or unexpected adverse effects that have prevented further development of the compound. Our ongoing clinical trials for regulatory approvals in jurisdictions outside the United States may not produce the results that we expect and remain subject to the risks associated with clinical drug development as indicated above.\nThe breadth of the labeling of any product or product candidate, if approved, will depend upon providing evidence of such product\u2019s MOA(s) that is satisfactory to the applicable regulatory authority. Failure to do so will limit the types of claims we will be able to make in our product marketing and labeling. For example, based on the results of our preclinical and clinical studies, we believed Rhopressa\u00ae reduced IOP through additional MOAs; however, Rhopressa\u00ae received FDA approval for only one MOA, ROCK inhibition or the mechanism by which Rhopressa\u00ae increases outflow of aqueous humor through the Trabecular Meshwork (\u201cTM\u201d) of the eye, as reflected in the Rhopressa\u00ae product labeling.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events that could cause our clinical trials to be unsuccessful, delayed, suspended or terminated, or which could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u2022\nclinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or implement a clinical hold;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we estimate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nregulators or IRBs may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022\nwe may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u2022\nwe may elect or be required to suspend or terminate clinical trials based on a finding that the participants are being exposed to health risks;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials may be insufficient or inadequate; and\n\u2022\nproduct candidates may have undesirable adverse effects or other unexpected characteristics.\nIf we elect or are required to suspend or terminate a clinical trial, our commercial prospects will be adversely impacted and our ability to generate product revenues may be delayed or eliminated.\nRhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates may have undesirable or adverse effects, which may result in the delay, denial or withdrawal of regulatory approval or may require our products to be taken off the market, require them to include safety warnings or otherwise limit their sales after regulatory approval is received.\nUnforeseen adverse effects from Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, even after approval, after the approved product has been marketed. To date, the main tolerability finding of Rhopressa\u00ae has been mild conjunctival hyperemia, or eye redness. In our Phase 3 registration trials, some patients also experienced conjunctival hemorrhages, or petechiae, corneal verticillata, blurry vision, and decreased visual acuity as adverse events. Rocklatan\u00ae combines Rhopressa\u00ae with latanoprost. To date, the main tolerability finding of Rocklatan\u00ae has also been mild conjunctival hyperemia. In our Phase 3 registration trials, some patients also experienced conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pruritus, increased lacrimation, reduced visual acuity, blepharitis, punctate keratitis and corneal disorder as adverse events. The main adverse effects of latanoprost include conjunctival hyperemia, irreversible change in iris color, discoloration of the skin around the eyes and droopiness of eyelids caused by the loss of orbital fat.\nWhile the FDA granted approval of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae based on the data included in their respective NDAs, we do not know whether the results when a larger number of patients in broader populations are exposed to the products, including results related to safety and efficacy, will be consistent with the results from our earlier clinical studies that served as the basis of FDA approval. New data relating to Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae, including from any adverse event reports or any negative results during clinical development for additional indications, may emerge at any time.\nAny undesirable or adverse effects that may be caused by any such products or product candidates could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the delay, denial or withdrawal of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications, and in turn prevent us from successfully commercializing Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, if approved, and generating or continuing to generate revenues from their sale. In addition, if we or others identify undesirable or adverse effects caused by Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates after regulatory approval we could face one or more of the following consequences:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may re-review the product and impose restrictions on its distribution;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a boxed warning or a contraindication, or other safety labeling changes;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (\u201cREMS\u201d);\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may seize the product;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way that the product is promoted or administered, conduct additional clinical trials or recall such product;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to litigation or product liability claims fines, injunctions or criminal penalties; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing such product, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating or continuing to generate revenues from its sale.\nWe currently have no international commercial operations. We intend to explore the licensing of commercialization rights or other forms of collaboration outside of the United States and we have developed internal manufacturing capabilities in Ireland, both of which will expose us to additional risks of conducting business in international markets.\nMarkets outside of the United States are a component of our growth strategy. If we fail to successfully commercialize, obtain licenses or enter into collaboration arrangements with selling parties, or if these parties are not successful, our revenue-generating growth potential will be adversely affected. As part of this strategy, in March 2015 and April 2015, we formed Aerie Limited and Aerie Ireland Limited, respectively. Additionally, in January 2017, we commenced establishment of our own manufacturing plant in Athlone, Ireland, which is expected to begin production of commercial supplies of Rocklatan\u00ae in the first quarter of 2020. We expect FDA approval to produce Rhopressa\u00ae at our Athlone plant by the end of 2020. We also anticipate the plant to have the capacity to produce Rhokiinsa\u00ae and, if approved, Roclanda\u00ae. We will continue to evaluate the\ncommercial prospects for Rhokiinsa\u00ae and Roclanda\u00ae in Europe based on the timing and substance of the Mercury 3 data for Roclanda\u00ae and other market conditions. We also opened an office in Dublin in 2015, in Tokyo in October 2018 and in London in 2019 to assist with our expected international expansion. International operations and business relationships subject us to additional risks that may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or sustain profitable operations, including:\n\u2022\nefforts to enter into or expand collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties in connection with our international sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution efforts may increase our expenses or divert our management\u2019s attention from the acquisition or development of product candidates;\n\u2022\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political and cultural climate or economic condition or changes in governmental regulations and laws;\n\u2022\ndiffering regulatory requirements for drug approvals, manufacturing and marketing internationally;\n\u2022\ndifficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions;\n\u2022\npotentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\npotential third-party patent rights in countries outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs, trade barriers and other regulatory requirements including those governing data privacy;\n\u2022\ndivergent environmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability, particularly in non-U.S. economies and markets, including several countries in Europe;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nthe effects of applicable foreign tax structures and potentially adverse tax consequences (including the tax reform law that was enacted in the United States in December 2017) that create uncertainty with respect to the tax impact on our business operations and profitability;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incidental to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\nthe potential for so-called parallel importing, which is what happens when a local seller, faced with high or higher local prices, opts to import goods from a foreign market (with low or lower prices) rather than buying them locally;\n\u2022\nfailure of our employees and contracted third parties to comply with Office of Foreign Asset Control rules and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters, including earthquakes, volcanoes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes and fires.\nThese and other risks may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or ability to attain or sustain revenue from international markets.\nIf we are found in violation of U.S. federal or state \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws or other healthcare laws and regulations, we may be required to pay a penalty and/or be suspended from participation in U.S. federal or state healthcare programs, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nIn the United States, our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, healthcare organizations, third-party payors and customers expose us to broadly applicable anti-bribery, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, market, sell and distribute our product candidates. Restrictions under applicable federal and state anti-bribery and healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:\n\u2022\nThe Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order or prescription\nof a particular drug for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Although we seek to structure our business arrangements in compliance with all applicable requirements, these laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how the law will be applied in specific circumstances. Accordingly, it is possible that our practices may be challenged under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute.\n\u2022\nThe Federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing to be presented for payment to the government, including the federal healthcare programs, claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services that were not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Many states have similar false claims laws. Cases have been brought under false claims laws alleging that off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products or the provision of kickbacks have resulted in the submission of false claims to governmental healthcare programs.\n\u2022\nUnder the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, we are prohibited from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services to obtain money or property of any healthcare benefit program.\nViolations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including penalties, fines and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the government under the Federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states.\nIn addition, certain manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, are required to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members, with the information made publicly available on a searchable website. Effective January 1, 2022, transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives must also be reported.\nMany states have adopted laws similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not just governmental payers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America\u2019s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement, we could be subject to penalties.\nFurthermore, the government purchasing and reimbursement programs include remedies such as the obligation to correct reported prices and pay additional rebates (depending on the direction of the correction) or pay restitution to the extent the government overpaid for covered drugs, In addition, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for conduct such as failure to provide required information, late submission of required information, false information, and knowingly and intentionally overcharging a 340B covered entity.\nNeither the government nor the courts have provided definitive guidance on the application of fraud and abuse laws to our business. Law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing these laws, and it is possible that some of our practices may be challenged under these laws. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. While we believe we have structured our business arrangements to comply with these laws, it is possible that the government could allege violations of, or convict us of violating, these laws. If we are found in violation of one of these laws, we could be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from governmental funded federal or state healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Were this to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nExisting and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost of commercializing our potential products and may affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our potential products, restrict or regulate post-marketing activities and affect our ability to profitably sell our potential products for which we obtain regulatory approval. Government elections in the jurisdictions in which we operate could affect the changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system. For example, the presidential and congressional elections in the United States in 2020 could affect the legislative and other proposals.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act (\u201cMMA\u201d) changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly by establishing Medicare Part D and introduced a reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs under Medicare Part B. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that are covered in any therapeutic class under the Part D program. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and reimbursement rate that we receive for any of our approved products. While the MMA only applies to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cPPACA\u201d) added provisions to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, PPACA increased manufacturers\u2019 rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products and required manufacturers to provide a discount off the negotiated price of prescriptions filled by beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, referred to as the \u201cdonut hole,\u201d which is now 70% of the negotiated price. There have been efforts by the Trump Administration and Congress to seek to repeal all or portions of PPACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d) was enacted in 2017, which includes a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the PPACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. While the Trump administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to repeal and replace the PPACA will impact the PPACA and our business.\nIn addition, the Trump Administration has indicated an intent to address prescription drug pricing and recent Congressional hearings have brought increased public attention to the costs of prescription drugs. The Trump Administration has made a number of proposals that are in early stages. Numerous bills have been introduced in Congress by members of both parties seeking to reduce drug prices using a variety of approaches. These actions and the uncertainty about the future of the PPACA and healthcare laws are likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. While we currently do not believe the implementation of any such initiatives would negatively impact our net sales or operating margins, these initiatives are in early stages.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been introduced at both the state and federal level to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether agencies such as the FDA or Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will issue new guidance or interpretations, whether existing guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on our sales and promotional activities for our approved products or the marketing approvals of our potential products may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing approval testing and other requirements.\nIf we face allegations of noncompliance with the law and encounter sanctions, our reputation, revenues and liquidity may suffer, and Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, if approved, could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenues. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory\napproval is withdrawn, the value of our company and our operating results will be materially adversely affected. Additionally, if we are unable to continue to generate revenues from our product sales, our potential for achieving profitability will be diminished and the need to raise capital to fund our operations will be increased.\nRhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any current or future product candidates, if approved, subject us to ongoing regulatory requirements and we may face future development, manufacturing and regulatory difficulties.\nRhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae are, and any current or future product candidates, if approved, will be, subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, submission of safety and other post-market approval information, importation and exportation. In addition, approved products, manufacturers and manufacturing facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA and EMA requirements and the requirements of other similar agencies, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to current good manufacturing requirements (\u201ccGMP\u201d) requirements. As such, we and our contract manufacturers are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work are required to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control. We are also required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA and the EMA and other similar agencies and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotion. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs also are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. Accordingly, we may not promote any product for indications, uses or claims for which they are not approved, even though physicians may prescribe them for those uses. If we want to expand any such indications for which we may market a product, we will need to obtain additional regulatory approvals, which may not be granted.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, if approved, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where such product is manufactured, or disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of such product, or finds that we have engaged in the promotion of off-label use, it may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of that product from the market. If either of our products fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022\nissue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nrequire product recalls;\n\u2022\nmandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u2022\nrequire us or our potential future collaborators to enter into a consent decree or permanent injunction, which can include shutdown of manufacturing facilities, imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022\nimpose other administrative or judicial civil or criminal penalties or pursue criminal prosecution;\n\u2022\nwithdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or by our potential future collaborators;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022\nseize or detain products.\nWe may not be able to identify additional therapeutic opportunities for Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates or to expand our portfolio of product candidates.\nWe continue to explore other therapeutic opportunities in ophthalmology through internal research programs and from time to time we may explore such opportunities through research collaboration arrangements or acquisitions and may seek to commercialize a portfolio of new ophthalmic drugs or technologies in addition to Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae. For example, in 2017, we entered into a collaboration arrangement with DSM, which was expanded in the third quarter of 2018, and acquired the rights to certain assets from Envisia, both of which are expected to support the development of our ongoing preclinical retinal programs. In addition to our preclinical retinal programs, we are conducting preclinical studies to evaluate potential additional indications for Rhopressa\u00ae and potentially Rocklatan\u00ae. In 2019, we acquired Avizorex, an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company developing therapeutics for the treatment of dry eye disease. Our clinical operations to date have been\nlimited to developing product candidates for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension, and there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop, license or acquire any drugs or technologies in new therapeutic areas or at all.\nPreclinical studies require additional research and development, which in some cases may include significant preclinical, clinical and other testing, prior to initiating clinical development or seeking regulatory approval to market new indications, technologies and/or product candidates. Accordingly, these additional indications, technologies and product candidates will not be commercially available for a number of years, if at all. In particular, although we are currently exploring additional indications for Rhopressa\u00ae, we cannot guarantee that we will pursue or receive the regulatory approvals required to promote Rhopressa\u00ae for any additional indications. Failure to receive such approvals will prevent us from promoting and commercializing Rhopressa\u00ae beyond its currently approved indication.\nResearch programs, including through collaboration arrangements, to pursue the development of Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae and any current or future product candidates for additional indications and to identify new product candidates, technologies, therapeutic areas and disease targets require substantial technical, financial and human resources whether or not we ultimately are successful. Our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential additional indications, technologies, therapeutic areas and/or product candidates, yet fail to yield results for clinical development for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nthe research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential additional indications, technologies, therapeutic areas and/or product candidates;\n\u2022\npotential additional indications, technologies, therapeutic areas or product candidates may, after further study, fail to demonstrate efficacy sufficient to warrant further clinical development;\n\u2022\npotential technologies or product candidates may, after further study, be shown to be ineffective or have harmful adverse effects or other characteristics that indicate they are unlikely to be effective drugs; or\n\u2022\nit may take greater human and financial resources to identify additional therapeutic opportunities or to develop suitable potential product candidates or technologies, whether through internal research programs, research collaboration arrangements or acquisitions, than we possess, thereby limiting our ability to diversify and expand our product portfolio.\nWe are also focused on furthering the development of our current and future product candidates focused on retinal diseases and dry eye disease. Through business development activities, in 2017 we acquired worldwide ophthalmic rights to a bio-erodible polymer technology from DSM and PRINT\u00ae implant manufacturing technology, which is a proprietary technology capable of creating precisely-engineered sustained-release products utilizing fully-scalable manufacturing processes, from Envisia. Using these technologies, we have created a sustained-release ophthalmology platform and are currently developing two sustained-release implants focused on retinal diseases, AR-1105, a dexamethasone IVT implant, and AR-13503, a ROCK/Protein kinase C inhibitor. In March 2019, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of AR-1105 in patients with macular edema due to retinal vein occlusion. In August 2019, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of AR-13503 SR in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration or diabetic macular edema. We acquired Avizorex in 2019 and are planning to initiate a Phase 2b study on AVX-012 in late 2020. The decision whether to pursue, and the timing of, any additional preclinical research programs is subject to a number of factors and we may suspend or discontinue research programs at any time.\nIn addition, because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential or a greater likelihood of success. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that we will ever be able to identify or develop additional therapeutic opportunities for Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates or any uses for our existing proprietary compounds beyond glaucoma or to develop suitable potential product candidates or technologies through internal research programs, research collaboration arrangements or acquisitions, which could materially adversely affect our future growth and prospects.\nRhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae are designed to treat patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, and the success or failure of either of them could impact sales of the other or other potential ROCK inhibitor products in the future.\nRhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae are designed to be once-daily dosed ROCK inhibitor eye drops to be applied topically to reduce IOP for the treatment of glaucoma or ocular hypertension. While we believe there is space for both Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae, we cannot guarantee that cannibalization of sales will not occur in the future. While increased sales for one of Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae may negatively impact sales for the other, our commercialization strategy is unique for each. Because each of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae are ROCK inhibitor eye drops designed to treat patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, any\nchallenges or failures with respect to either of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae could negatively impact sales or the public perception of the other or any other potential ROCK inhibitor products we may develop in the future.\nRisks Related to Manufacturing\nWe anticipate continued reliance on third-party manufacturers for the development and commercialization of Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae and any current or future product candidates in accordance with manufacturing regulations, beyond our recent progress in internal manufacturing capabilities.\nWith respect to the commercial production of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae, we currently have contractual relationships for finished product manufacturing with two vendors and are outsourcing the production of the API. To the extent we terminate our existing supplier arrangements in the future and seek to enter into arrangements with alternative suppliers, we might experience a delay in our ability to obtain our clinical or commercial supplies.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks, including:\n\u2022\nmanufacturing delays if our third-party manufacturers give greater priority to the supply of other products over Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, if approved, or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of their agreements with us;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval for Rhopressa\u00ae and/or Rocklatan\u00ae outside the United States or any current or future product candidates, if our third-party manufacturers fail to satisfy or comply with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n\u2022\nproduct loss due to contamination, equipment failure or improper installation or operation of equipment or operator error;\n\u2022\nthe failure of the third-party manufacturer to comply with applicable regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\nthe possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how.\nFor example, in October 2016, we were required to withdraw the initial submission of our NDA for Rhopressa\u00ae due to a contract manufacturer of our drug product not being prepared for pre-approval inspection by the FDA. We resubmitted the Rhopressa\u00ae NDA in February 2017 upon receiving confirmation from the contract manufacturer that it was prepared for FDA inspection and the Rhopressa\u00ae NDA was subsequently approved in December 2017.\nIn addition, our manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business. In the event of a natural disaster, business failure, strike or other difficulty, we may be unable to replace a third-party manufacturer in a timely manner and the production of Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates could be interrupted, resulting in delays and additional costs. We may also have to incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications and undertake remediation efforts.\nIn January 2017, we commenced establishment of our own manufacturing plant in Athlone, Ireland. This is our first manufacturing plant, which is expected to begin production of commercial supplies of Rocklatan\u00ae in the first quarter of 2020. In January 2020, we received FDA approval to produce Rocklatan\u00ae at the Athlone plant for commercial distribution in the United States. This approval follows a successful pre-approval inspection of the plant and FDA review of the PAS, which added the Athlone manufacturing plant as a drug product manufacturer for Rocklatan\u00ae. We expect FDA approval to produce commercial supplies of Rhopressa\u00ae at our Athlone plant by the end of 2020. We also anticipate the Athlone manufacturing plant to have the capacity to produce Rhokiinsa\u00ae and, if approved, Roclanda\u00ae. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manufacture our final drug product on a commercial scale or in accordance with manufacturing regulations. See \u201c-We have limited experience developing manufacturing facilities or manufacturing Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop our manufacturing plant or manufacture Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae at full capacity and in compliance with regulations at a cost or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable.\u201d If our manufacturing operations fail to achieve regulatory approval or to effectively produce commercial supplies of Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, if approved, or until such time we are capable of developing internal manufacturing capabilities, we will be required to rely solely on third-party manufacturers to meet our commercial manufacturing needs, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial\ncondition.\nWe commenced operation of our cGMP-validated manufacturing facility for production of ophthalmic implants using the proprietary PRINT\u00ae technology platform in the fourth quarter of 2018. This facility is not being used to produce commercial supplies of Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae.\nIf we or third-party manufacturers fail to comply with manufacturing regulations, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nBefore we or a third party can begin commercial manufacture of Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, if approved, we or the third party must obtain regulatory approval of our or their manufacturing facilities, processes and quality systems. If our third-party manufacturers do not have a cGMP compliance status acceptable to the FDA, approval of any NDA that includes those third-party manufacturers will be delayed.\nDue to the complexity of the processes used to manufacture pharmaceutical products and product candidates, we or any potential third-party manufacturer may be unable to initially pass federal, state or international regulatory inspections in a cost-effective manner. We or certain of our contract manufacturers may fail to satisfy or comply with manufacturing regulations. If we or our contract manufacturers do not have a compliance status acceptable to the FDA, regulatory approval and/or commercial supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredients of Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, if approved, will be significantly delayed and may result in significant additional costs.\nIn addition, pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are continuously subject to inspection by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, before and after product approval, and must comply with cGMP. We or our contract manufacturers may encounter difficulties in achieving quality control and quality assurance and may experience shortages in qualified personnel. In addition, failure to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or the incidence of manufacturing errors, could result in patient injury, product liability claims, product shortages, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business. If we or a third-party manufacturer with whom we contract is unable to comply with manufacturing regulations, we may be subject to fines, unanticipated compliance expenses, recall or seizure of our products, product liability claims, total or partial suspension of production and/or enforcement actions, including injunctions and criminal or civil prosecution. These possible sanctions could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial results and financial condition.\nFurthermore, changes in the manufacturing process or procedure, including a change in the location where the product is manufactured or a change of a third-party manufacturer, will require prior FDA or other regulatory review and/or approval of the manufacturing process and procedures in accordance with the FDA\u2019s regulations or comparable foreign requirements. This review may be costly and time consuming and could delay or prevent the launch or commercial production of a product. The new facility will also be subject to pre-approval inspection. In addition, we have to demonstrate that the product made at the new facility is equivalent to the product made at the former facility by physical and chemical methods, which are costly and time consuming. It is also possible that the FDA may require clinical testing as a way to prove equivalency, which would result in additional costs and delay.\nWe have limited experience developing manufacturing facilities or manufacturing Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop our manufacturing plant or manufacture Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae at full capacity and in compliance with regulations at a cost or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable.\nIn January 2020, we received FDA approval to produce Rocklatan\u00ae at the Athlone manufacturing plant for commercial distribution in the United States and expect to begin production of commercial supplies of Rocklatan\u00ae for the United States in the first quarter of 2020. This approval follows a successful pre-approval inspection of the plant and FDA review of the PAS, which added the Athlone manufacturing plant as a drug product manufacturer for Rocklatan\u00ae. We expect FDA approval to produce Rhopressa\u00ae at our Athlone plant by the end of 2020. We also anticipate the Athlone manufacturing plant to have the capacity to produce Rhokiinsa\u00ae and, if approved, Roclanda\u00ae. We have limited experience in developing manufacturing facilities or manufacturing drug products. As the Athlone plant output commences and expands, per unit costs will suffer until the proper capacity levels are achieved, thus generating a unit cost that is higher than we currently have with our contract manufacturers.\nThe development of manufacturing facilities and the manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. The equipment and facilities employed in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals are subject to stringent qualification requirements by regulatory agencies, including validation of facility, equipment, systems, processes and analytics. We may be subject to lengthy delays and\nexpense in conducting validation studies. There can be no assurance that we will obtain permission or approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities to allow the plant to manufacture Rhopressa\u00ae for export to the United States and other markets.\nOur manufacturing operations and those of our third-party suppliers are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the use, storage, generation, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes, the cleanup of hazardous substance releases, exposure to hazardous substances and emissions or discharges into the air or water. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in significant business interruptions and/or civil and criminal penalties. New laws and regulations, violations of or amendments to existing laws or regulations, or stricter enforcement of existing requirements, could require us to incur material costs, subject us to new or increased liabilities, and cause disruptions to our manufacturing activities that could be material.\nManufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, especially in scaling up initial production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control and assurance and shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced regulations. If we are unable to effectively produce commercial supplies of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae, we will be required to rely on a third-party manufacturer to meet our commercial manufacturing needs, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See \u201c-We anticipate continued reliance on third-party manufacturers for the development and commercialization of Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae and any current or future product candidates in accordance with manufacturing regulations, beyond our recent progress in internal manufacturing capabilities.\u201d\nAny of these risks could entail higher costs, cause us to delay production and may result in our being unable to effectively support commercialization of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae. Furthermore, if we fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of product on a timely basis, and at commercially reasonable prices and acceptable quality, we would likely be unable to meet demand, if any, for Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and we would lose potential revenues.\nProduction at our suppliers\u2019 facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers' demands.\nA disruption in production at our suppliers\u2019 facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Disruptions or interruptions of production or operations could occur for many reasons, including accidents, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems, cyber security incidents, terrorism, acts of war or political unrest, disease or public health crises, strikes or other labor unrest, transportation interruption or other unforeseen events as a result of weather, fire, natural disasters or otherwise. Additional facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production due to the need for FDA approval, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. If one of our key suppliers is unable to produce our products or raw materials for an extended period of time, our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers' needs, which may materially adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nFor example, in December 2019, a strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout China and other parts of the world. We maintain a supply chain structure that presently allows us to avoid the current coronavirus outbreak. We also maintain a limited supply of starting materials in house. However, the future impact of this outbreak is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If the coronavirus spreads to other regions, including to India or Ireland, or if the duration of the disruption is longer than anticipated, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have recently begun commercializing Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae, have limited revenue and may never become profitable.\nWe have a limited operating history and began commercializing our first product Rhopressa\u00ae in the United States in April 2018, and our second product Rocklatan\u00ae in the United States in May 2019. We have never been profitable and only have two products approved for commercial sale. Even though we received FDA approval, began commercial sales for these two products in the United States and received the centralised marketing authorisation for Rhokiinsa\u00ae by the EC, we are still in the process of obtaining additional regulatory approvals in jurisdictions outside the United States and there is no guarantee that either product will be approved in any such jurisdictions.\nOur ability to generate product revenue depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nmaintain an acceptable price for each of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae in the United States;\n\u2022\nset acceptable net prices for our glaucoma products outside the United States that allow for adequate profitability, in a stand-alone or partnered environment;\n\u2022\nset an acceptable price for any current or future product candidates, if approved, and obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers;\n\u2022\nmanufacture or obtain commercial quantities of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any current or future product candidates, if approved, at acceptable cost levels;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully market and sell Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any current or future product candidates, if approved, in the United States and other jurisdictions; and\n\u2022\nsuccessfully complete clinical development, and receive regulatory approval, for our current and any future product candidates.\nOur net product revenue may be impacted by the accuracy of our estimates for discounts and allowances, in which estimates for reserves are based on current contractual and statutory requirements, invoices from CMS for the company funded portion of the coverage gap, known market events and trends, industry data, forecasted customer mix and lagged claims. In addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, commercialization and manufacturing, we are unable to precisely predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. In addition, our expenses could increase beyond expectations for a number of reasons, including if we are required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities to perform studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Even though we have begun commercial sales of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae, we are still incurring and anticipate continuing to incur significant costs associated with commercialization activities.\nOur ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue. Although we have generated revenues from the sales of our products, even if we were able to continue to generate revenues from our products and to generate revenues from current or future product candidates, if approved, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could materially impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business or continue our operations.\nWe have incurred net losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses until such a time when Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae are commercially successful, if at all.\nWe have incurred losses in each year since our inception in June 2005. Our net losses were $199.6 million, $232.6 million and $145.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $896.0 million.\nInvestment in pharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that a product candidate will fail to gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. We have devoted the majority of our historical financial resources to research and development, including our non-clinical development activities and clinical trials. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and issuance of convertible debt, including the completion of our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) in October 2013, the issuance of $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes (the \u201c2014 Convertible Notes\u201d) to Deerfield in September 2014, which were converted into shares of common stock in July 2018, the issuance of $316.25 million of 1.50% convertible notes due 2024 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) in September 2019, and the issuance and sale of common stock pursuant to our registration statements on Form S-3 and prior \u201cat-the-market\u201d sales agreements. Our products will continue to require significant marketing efforts and substantial investment to maintain and increase revenues. Any current or future product candidates will require the completion of regulatory review, significant marketing efforts and substantial investment before they can provide us with any revenue.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to continue to be significant in connection with our ongoing and planned activities. In addition, as we have now launched Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased manufacturing, selling and marketing expenses. As a result, we expect to continue to incur operating losses until our products generate adequate commercial revenue to render Aerie profitable. These losses have had and will continue to have a material adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity, financial position, cash flows and working capital.\nWe may need to obtain additional financing to fund our operations and, if we are unable to obtain such financing, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. In October 2013, we received net proceeds from our IPO of approximately $68.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses. Since our IPO through December 31, 2019, we have raised additional net proceeds of approximately $122.9 million from the issuance of the 2014 Convertible Notes, which were converted into shares of common stock in July 2018, approximately $308.3 million from the issuance of the Convertible Notes and approximately $487.7 million through the issuance and sale of common stock under our shelf registration statements on Form S-3 and prior \u201cat-the-market\u201d sales agreements.\nWe may need to obtain additional financing to fund our future operations. Additionally, we may need to obtain additional financing to conduct additional trials for the approval of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae in additional jurisdictions or any current or future product candidates, and for completing the development of any additional product candidates or technologies and executing our international expansion strategy. Moreover, our fixed expenses, such as rent and other contractual commitments, are substantial and are expected to increase in the future, and we also expect to incur increased expenses as we expand our employment base.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe amount of sales and other revenues from Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any current or future product candidates, if approved, including the selling prices for such potential products and the availability of adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement;\n\u2022\nselling and marketing costs associated with Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any current or future product candidates, if approved, including the cost and timing of expanding our marketing and sales capabilities;\n\u2022\nour commercial success with our commercialized products and any current or future product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022\nthe terms and timing of any collaborations, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u2022\ncash requirements of any future acquisitions and/or the development of other product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022\nthe progress, timing, scope and costs of our clinical trials, including the ability to timely enroll patients in our planned and potential future clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals that may be required by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to establish internal manufacturing capabilities or arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022\ncosts of any new business strategies;\n\u2022\nthe costs of operating as a public company;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments; and\n\u2022\nthe costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, investments and expected cash flows will be sufficient to support the product commercialization of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae through at least the next twelve months. We also intend to use these funds for general corporate purposes, including our clinical, regulatory and commercialization efforts beyond the United States, further development of other potential pipeline opportunities including activities to support execution of our dry eye and retina programs, our external business development efforts and our manufacturing activities, including the operation of our own manufacturing plant in Ireland.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue, we may need to finance future cash needs through additional financings or other available sources. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay or reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization or manufacturing efforts. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or\nlicensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nOur forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operating requirements is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We have based this estimate on a number of assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and changing circumstances beyond our control may cause us to consume capital more rapidly than we currently anticipate. Our inability to obtain additional funding when we need it could seriously harm our business.\nOur indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Convertible Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $316.25 million in principal amount of indebtedness as a result of the issuance of the Convertible Notes. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Interest payments, fees, covenants and restrictions under agreements governing our current or future indebtedness, including the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nimpairing our ability to successfully continue to commercialize Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae and commercialize any current or future product candidates, which would prevent us from generating a source of revenue and becoming profitable;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, debt obligations and other general corporate requirements, and making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to any such additional financing;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general economic downturns, competition and industry conditions, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with no debt obligations or with debt obligations on more favorable terms;\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business; and\n\u2022\ndiluting the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows and ability to satisfy our obligations under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes and any other indebtedness.\nOur business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our indebtedness, including the Convertible Notes, and our cash needs may increase in the future. In addition, the agreements governing indebtedness that we may incur in the future may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.\nWe may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Convertible Notes for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion, and the terms of our then-existing borrowing arrangements may limit our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or pay cash upon their conversion.\nNoteholders may require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes following a fundamental change at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion, we will satisfy part or all of our conversion obligation in cash unless we elect to settle conversions solely in shares of our common stock. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the Convertible Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing any of our then-existing borrowing arrangements may restrict our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. If we fail to repurchase Convertible Notes or\nto pay the cash amounts due upon conversion when required, we will be in default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes and may be in default under any other then-existing borrowing arrangements. A default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under any of our then-existing agreements governing our other indebtedness, which may result in that other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts due under the Convertible Notes and any other then-existing indebtedness.\nThe accounting method for the Convertible Notes could adversely affect our reported financial condition and results.\nThe accounting method for reflecting the Convertible Notes on our balance sheet, accruing interest expense for the Convertible Notes and reflecting the underlying shares of our common stock in our reported diluted earnings per share may adversely affect our reported earnings and financial condition.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 470, Debt, the initial liability carrying amount of the Convertible Notes is the fair value of a similar debt instrument that does not have a conversion feature, valued using our cost of capital for straight, unconvertible debt. We reflect the difference of approximately $128.4 million between the net proceeds from the Convertible Notes and the initial carrying amount as a debt discount for accounting purposes, which is being amortized into interest expense over the term of the Convertible Notes. In addition, the debt issuance costs relating to the Convertible Notes were allocated to debt and equity components in proportion to the allocation of proceeds. Issuance costs of $5.5 million were recorded as debt issuance costs in the net carrying value of Convertible Notes. The debt issuance costs are amortized on an effective interest basis over the term of the Convertible Notes. The remaining issuance costs of $3.7 million were recorded as additional paid-in capital and such amounts are not subject to amortization. As a result of this amortization, the interest expense that we expect to recognize for the Convertible Notes for accounting purposes will be greater than the cash interest payments we will pay on the Convertible Notes, which will result in lower reported income or higher reported loss. The lower reported income or higher reported loss resulting from this accounting treatment could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition, because we intend to settle conversions by paying the conversion value in cash up to the principal amount being converted, with the potential of any excess in shares of common stock, we expect to be eligible to use the treasury stock method to reflect the shares underlying the Convertible Notes in our diluted earnings per share. Under this method, if the conversion value of the Convertible Notes exceeds their principal amount for a reporting period, then we will calculate our diluted earnings per share assuming that all the Convertible Notes were converted and that we issued shares of our common stock to settle the excess. However, if reflecting the Convertible Notes in diluted earnings per share in this manner is anti-dilutive, or if the conversion value of the Convertible Notes does not exceed their principal amount for a reporting period, then the shares of common stock underlying the Convertible Notes will not be reflected in our diluted earnings per share. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method and/or under what conditions the treasury stock method would remain available for convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes). If we are unable or otherwise elect not to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, then our diluted earnings (net loss) per share of common stock could be adversely affected. For example, in July 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board published an exposure draft proposing to amend these accounting standards to eliminate the treasury stock method for convertible instruments and instead require application of the \u201cif-converted\u201d method. Under that method, if it is adopted, diluted earnings per share would generally be calculated assuming that all the Convertible Notes were converted solely into shares of common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. The application of the if-converted method may reduce our reported diluted earnings per share. Furthermore, if any of the conditions to the convertibility of the Convertible Notes is satisfied, then we may be required under applicable accounting standards to reclassify the liability carrying value of the Convertible Notes as a current, rather than a long-term, liability. This reclassification could be required even if no noteholders convert their Convertible Notes and could materially reduce our reported working capital.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the aggregate principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The option counterparties or their respective affiliates are expected to modify their hedge positions from time to time by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock, the Convertible Notes or other securities or instruments of ours (if any) in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of Convertible Notes or following any issuance of\na notice of redemption with respect to the Convertible Notes). Any of these activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the market price of the shares of our common stock.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\nThe counterparties to the capped call transactions are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that one or more of the counterparties may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate, their obligations under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have in the past resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If any option counterparty becomes subject to proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under any capped call transactions with that option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, our exposure will increase if the market price or the volatility of our common stock increases. In addition, upon a default or other failure to perform, or a termination of obligations, by a counterparty, the counterparty may fail to deliver the shares of common stock required to be delivered to us under the capped call transactions and we may suffer adverse tax consequences or experience more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the counterparties.\nWe may sell additional debt or equity securities at any time, which may result in dilution to our stockholders and impose restrictions on our business.\nIn order to raise additional funds to support our operations, business strategies and growth, or if we decide based on ongoing forecast updates, new strategic initiatives, market conditions or for other reasons that additional financings are desirable or needed, we may sell additional debt or equity securities, which would result in dilution to all of our stockholders or impose restrictive covenants that adversely impact our business. In September 2016, our automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 became effective upon filing with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unlimited amount of common stock from time to time, and, through the date of this report, we have issued and sold approximately 7.4 million shares of common stock pursuant to such shelf registration statement. Although our existing shelf registration statement on Form S-3 expired on September 15, 2019, for so long as we remain a well-known seasoned issuer we will be able to file a new automatic shelf registration statement covering our equity or debt securities. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur relatively short operating history may make it difficult for investors to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe were incorporated and commenced active operations in the second quarter of 2005. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing our product candidates and advancing Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae to FDA approval and commercial launch. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully manufacture a widely-sold commercial scale product. Consequently, any predictions about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history.\nIn addition, as a relatively new business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. We have recently transitioned from a company with solely a product development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial and manufacturing activities and we may not be successful with these endeavors.\nDetermining our income tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty.\nThe computation of income tax provisions is complex, as it is based on the laws of federal, state, local and non-U.S. taxing jurisdictions and requires significant judgment on the application of complicated rules governing accounting for tax provisions under U.S. GAAP. Our provision for income tax can be materially impacted, for example, by the geographical mix of our profits and losses, changes in our business, such as internal restructuring and acquisitions, changes in tax laws and accounting guidance and other regulatory, legislative or judicial developments, transfer pricing policies, tax audit determinations, changes in our uncertain tax positions, changes in our capital structure and leverage, changes to our transfer pricing practices, tax deductions attributed to equity and other compensation and limitations on such deductions and changes in our need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. In addition, relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to\nthe income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates and reduced cash flows than otherwise would be expected. For these reasons, our actual income taxes may be materially different than our provision for income tax.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nIf we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d for purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d), or similar state provisions, we may be subject to annual limits on our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards. An ownership change is, as a general matter, triggered by sales or acquisitions of our stock in excess of 50% on a cumulative basis during a three-year period by persons owning 5% or more of our total equity value.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had U.S. federal and state net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of approximately $495.6 million and $510.3 million, respectively. If not utilized, federal NOLs that arose before 2018 and state NOLs begin to expire at various dates beginning in 2031 and 2024, respectively. Federal NOLs that arose on or after January 1, 2018 can be carried forward indefinitely to be utilized against future income, but can only be used to offset a maximum of 80% of our federal taxable income in any year. Our federal and state NOLs are included as deferred tax assets and have been fully offset by a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we also had foreign NOLs of $68.1 million which are available solely to offset taxable income of our foreign subsidiaries, subject to any applicable limitations under foreign law.\nChanges to the United States tax laws could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. The Tax Act makes extensive changes to the U.S. tax laws and includes provisions that, among other things, reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate, repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax (\u201cAMT\u201d) and refund certain existing AMT credits over several years, introduce a capital investment deduction, limit the interest deduction, limit the use of net operating losses to offset future taxable income, limit the deduction for compensation paid to certain executive officers and make extensive changes to the U.S. international tax system, including the taxation of foreign earnings of U.S. multinational corporations. Further, due to the expansion of our international business activities, changes enacted in the Tax Act with respect to the U.S. taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. The U.S. Treasury Department has released regulations implementing the Tax Act and is expected to release additional regulations and the U.S. tax laws may be further amended in the future. The Tax Act is complex and far-reaching and we cannot predict with certainty the resulting impact its enactment will have on us.\nOur international operations subject us to potentially adverse tax consequences.\nWe generally conduct our international operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries and report our taxable income, if any, in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Our intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with any of our determinations including as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions and the statutory domiciles of our intellectual property. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates and reduced cash flows.\nIn addition, jurisdictions outside the United States could challenge aspects of the Tax Act or implement reactionary legislation or regulations that could adversely affect us and/or negate or minimize any favorable impact that we may derive from the Tax Act in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe currently depend on third parties to conduct some of the operations of our clinical trials and other portions of our operations, and we may not be able to control their work as effectively as if we performed these functions ourselves.\nWe rely on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to oversee and conduct our clinical trials and to perform the related data collection and analysis. We expect to rely on these third parties to conduct clinical trials of any current or future product candidates that we develop. These parties are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. In addition, any CRO that we retain will be subject to the FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements or similar foreign standards and we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by these providers. Our agreements with third-party service providers are on a trial-by-trial and project-by-project bases. Typically, we may terminate the agreements with notice and are responsible for the third party\u2019s\nincurred costs. If any of our relationships with our third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. We also rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials and commercial supply. Any performance failure on the part of our third-party vendors could delay, as applicable, clinical development, regulatory approval or commercialization of Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nOur reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities, and we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan, the protocols for the trial and the FDA\u2019s regulations and international standards, referred to as GCP requirements, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Preclinical studies must also be conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act requirements. Managing performance of third-party service providers can be difficult, time consuming and cause delays in our development programs. We currently have a small number of employees, which limits the internal resources we have available to identify and monitor our third-party providers.\nFurthermore, these third parties may produce or manufacture competing drugs or may have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. The use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated.\nIf these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations and meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols according to regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our financial results and the commercial prospects for Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any current or future product candidates, if approved, could be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to obtain regulatory approval (as applicable) and commence product sales could be delayed.\nIf we fail to manage an effective distribution process in the United States or establish an effective distribution process in jurisdictions outside the United States, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe have established the infrastructure necessary for distributing pharmaceutical products in which third-party logistics wholesalers warehouse Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and distribute them to pharmacies and will need to establish such infrastructures in jurisdictions outside the United States. This distribution network requires significant coordination with our sales and marketing and finance organizations, and the failure to coordinate financial systems could negatively impact our ability to accurately report product revenue. If we are unable to effectively manage the distribution process, the continued commercialization of our products could be disrupted or the commercial launch and sales of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae in jurisdictions outside the United States, in any such case, or any current or future product candidates, if approved, will be delayed or severely compromised and our results of operations may be harmed.\nAny collaboration arrangement that we may enter into may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize any current or future product candidates or technologies or to enter new therapeutic areas.\nWe continually explore and discuss additional opportunities for new ophthalmic products, delivery alternatives and new therapeutic areas with potential partners and on our own. We may seek collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies or universities for the development or commercialization of our current and potential current or future product candidates or technologies. For example, in 2017, we entered into a collaborative research, development and licensing agreement with DSM, which was expanded in the third quarter of 2018. Part of our globalization strategy is to partner in Japan. We will face, to the extent that we decide to enter into additional collaboration agreements, significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Moreover, collaboration arrangements are often complicated and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish, implement and maintain collaborations or other alternative arrangements and the terms of such arrangements may not be favorable to us. If and when we collaborate with a third party for development and commercialization of a product candidate and/or technology, we can expect to relinquish some or all of the control over the future success of that product candidate and/or technology to the third party. The success of our collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any collaboration or licensing arrangement or similar strategic transaction we enter into will result in the benefits that we anticipate.\nDisagreements between parties to a collaboration arrangement regarding research, clinical development and commercialization matters can lead to delays in the development process or commercializing the applicable product candidate or technology and, in some cases, termination of the collaboration arrangement. These disagreements can be difficult to resolve if neither of the\nparties has final decision-making authority. In addition, collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our preclinical molecules or product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on our results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products or technologies, availability of funding, or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities. Collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies and other third parties often are terminated or allowed to expire by the other party. Any such termination or expiration may adversely affect us financially and could harm our business reputation.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary technology in the marketplace.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality, licensing and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. Our success depends in large part on our ability and any future licensee\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We believe we will be able to obtain, through prosecution of our current pending patent applications, adequate patent protection for our proprietary drug technology. If we are compelled to spend significant time and money protecting or enforcing our patents, designing around patents held by others or licensing or acquiring, potentially for large fees, patents or other proprietary rights held by others, our business and financial prospects may be harmed. If we are unable to effectively protect the intellectual property that we own, other companies may be able to offer the same or similar products for sale, which could materially adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects. Our patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing the same or similar products or limit the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical products are often complex and uncertain. The standards of patentability as well as the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents in the United States and many jurisdictions outside of the United States is not consistent. For example, in many jurisdictions the support standards for pharmaceutical patents are becoming increasingly strict. Some countries prohibit method of treatment claims in patents. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or create uncertainty. In addition, publication of information related to our current product and potential products may prevent us from obtaining or enforcing patents relating to such product and potential products, including without limitation composition-of-matter patents, which are generally believed to offer the strongest patent protection.\nOur intellectual property includes issued patents and pending patent applications for compositions of matter, pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use, medical devices and synthetic methods. As of December 31, 2019, we owned 46 patents and have 21 pending patent applications in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions for Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae. Patent protection for Rocklatan\u00ae includes the U.S. patents that cover Rhopressa\u00ae. The patents cover composition of matter and method of use. As of December 31, 2019, we owned and had pending patent applications in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions for our product candidates. Our exclusive license regarding AVX-012 provides us with exclusive rights in patents covering AVX-012 and its use in treating dry-eye in the United States and pending patent applications internationally. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2019, for AR-1105 we had two pending patent applications in the United States and eight pending patent applications internationally. One of the U.S. pending patent applications has been allowed. With respect to AR-13503, as of December 31, 2019, we owned 37 patent applications and had 15 pending patent applications internationally for AR-13503. See \u201cBusiness-Intellectual Property\u201d for further information about our issued patents and patent applications.\nPatents that we own or may license in the future do not necessarily ensure the protection of our intellectual property for a number of reasons, including without limitation the following:\n\u2022\nour patents may not be broad or strong enough to prevent competition from other products that are identical or similar to Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae;\n\u2022\nthere can be no assurance that the term of a patent can be extended under the provisions of Patent Term Extension (\u201cPTE\u201d) afforded by U.S. law or similar provisions in foreign countries, where available;\n\u2022\nour issued patents and patents that we may obtain in the future may not prevent generic entry into the markets for Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae;\n\u2022\nwe do not currently own or control foreign patents issued outside of Australia, Canada, Europe and Japan that would prevent generic entry into those markets for Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to disclaim part of the term of one or more patents;\n\u2022\nthere may be prior art of which we are not aware that may affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim;\n\u2022\nthere may be prior art of which we are aware, which we do not believe affects the validity or enforceability of a patent claim, but which, nonetheless, ultimately may be found to affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim;\n\u2022\nthere may be other patents issued to others that will affect our freedom to operate;\n\u2022\nif our patents are challenged, a court of competent jurisdiction could determine that they are invalid or unenforceable;\n\u2022\nthere might be a significant change in the law that governs patentability, validity and infringement of our patents that adversely affects the scope of our patent rights;\n\u2022\na court of competent jurisdiction could determine that a competitor\u2019s technology or product does not infringe our patents; and\n\u2022\nour patents could irretrievably lapse due to failure to pay fees or otherwise comply with regulations or could be subject to compulsory licensing.\nOur competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. Our competitors may seek to market generic versions of Rhopressa\u00ae and/or Rocklatan\u00ae by submitting ANDAs to the FDA in which our competitors claim that our patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. In addition, our competitors may file patent applications that may have an impact on our ability to make, use and sell products that contain Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae. Should such a competitor\u2019s patent application(s) issue, it is possible the competitor will allege that our making, using or selling of products containing Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae infringes such issued patents. In such circumstances, we may need to challenge such pending applications or issued patents, or perhaps come to a financial arrangement with the competitor.\nAlternatively, our competitors may seek approval to market their own products similar to or otherwise competitive with our products. In these circumstances, we may need to defend and/or assert our patents, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. In any of these types of proceedings, a court or other agency having competent jurisdiction may find our patents invalid and/or unenforceable. We may also fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Even if we have valid and enforceable patents, these patents still may not provide protection against competing products or processes sufficient to achieve our business objectives.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, ownership, priority, validity or enforceability. In that regard, third parties may challenge our patents in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and potential products. In addition, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized.\nA significant portion of our intellectual property portfolio currently comprises pending patent applications that have not yet been issued as granted patents. If our pending patent applications fail to issue our business will be adversely affected.\nOur commercial success will depend significantly on maintaining and expanding patent protection for Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any current or future product candidates, as well as successfully defending our current and future patents against third-party challenges. As of December 31, 2019, we owned 108 patents and have 114 pending patent applications in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions relating to Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae and our previously discontinued product candidates and other proprietary technology. See \u201cBusiness-Intellectual Property\u201d included elsewhere in this report for further information about our issued patents and patent applications. Our issued patents include 46 patents for composition of matter and method of use covering Rhopressa\u00ae in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. These patents also cover Rocklatan\u00ae to the extent that Rhopressa\u00ae forms a part of Rocklatan\u00ae. The remainder of our portfolio is made up of patents covering previously discontinued product candidates and other proprietary technology and pending patent applications that have not yet been issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the \u201cUSPTO\u201d), or any other jurisdiction that covers Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or our previously discontinued product candidates or other proprietary technology.\nThere can be no assurance that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents in the United States or foreign jurisdictions in which such applications are pending. Even if patents do issue on any of these applications, there can be no assurance that a third party will not challenge their validity or enforceability, or that we will obtain sufficient claim scope in those patents to prevent a third party from competing successfully with our products.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to life sciences. It may be difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of these intellectual property rights in any foreign jurisdictions. For example, some foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property.\nWe may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our product development efforts and disrupt the commercialization of or increase the costs of commercializing Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, if approved.\nOur commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. If patents issued to other companies contain blocking, dominating or conflicting claims and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid, we may be required to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative non-infringing technology and cease practicing those activities, including potentially manufacturing or selling any products deemed to infringe those patents. There could be issued patents of which we are not aware that Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any current product candidates infringe. There also could be patents that we believe we do not infringe, but that we may ultimately be found to infringe.\nMoreover, patent applications are in some cases maintained in secrecy until patents are issued. The publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made and patent applications were filed. Because patents can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae, Rhokiinsa\u00ae or any current or future product candidates infringe. For example, pending applications may exist that claim or can be amended to claim subject matter that Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae, Rhokiinsa\u00ae or any current or future product candidates infringe. Competitors may file continuing patent applications claiming priority to already issued patents in the form of continuation, divisional, or continuation-in-part applications, in order to maintain the pendency of a patent family and attempt to cover Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae, Rhokiinsa\u00ae or any current or future product candidates.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization and may sue us for patent or other intellectual property infringement. These lawsuits are costly and could adversely affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae, Rhokiinsa\u00ae or any current or future product candidates or methods either do not infringe the claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims asserted are invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. If a court holds that any third-party patents are valid, enforceable and cover our products or their use, the holders of any of these patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae, Rhokiinsa\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, if approved, unless we acquire or obtain a license under the applicable patents or until the patents expire. We may not be able to enter into licensing arrangements or make other arrangements at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms. Any inability to secure licenses or alternative technology could result in delays in the introduction of our products or lead to prohibition of the manufacture or sale of products by us. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing\ntechnology or product. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing one or more of our current products and potential products or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Any claims by third parties that we have misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets could have a similar negative impact on our business. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees have misappropriated the intellectual property, including trade secrets, of a third party, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities, biotechnology companies or other pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, including members of our senior management, executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the intellectual property and other proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed such intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. We are not aware of any threatened or pending claims related to these matters or concerning the agreements with members of our senior management, but litigation may be necessary in the future to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIn addition, while we typically require our employees, consultants and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own, which may result in claims by or against us related to the ownership of such intellectual property. If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management and scientific personnel.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and technological advances, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. However, any party with whom we have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets. Accordingly, these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Further, the FDA, as part of its Transparency Initiative, a proposal by the FDA to increase disclosure and make data more accessible to the public, is currently considering whether to make additional information publicly available on a routine basis, including information that we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information, and it is not clear at the present time how the FDA\u2019s disclosure policies may change in the future, if at all. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position and financial results.\nAny lawsuits relating to infringement of intellectual property rights brought by or against us will be costly and time consuming and may adversely impact the price of our common stock.\nWe may be required to initiate litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property. These lawsuits can be very time consuming and costly. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industry generally. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating expenses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities.\nIn any infringement litigation, any award of monetary damages we receive may not be commercially valuable. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically\nlast for years before they are resolved. Further, any claims we assert against a perceived infringer could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we have infringed their patents. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIn addition, our patents and patent applications could face other challenges, such as interference proceedings, opposition proceedings, re-examination proceedings, and other forms of post-grant review. Any of these challenges, if successful, could result in the invalidation of, or in a narrowing of the scope of, any of our patents and patent applications subject to challenge. Any of these challenges, regardless of their success, would likely be time consuming and expensive to defend and resolve and would divert our management and scientific personnel\u2019s time and attention. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe will need to obtain regulatory approval of any proposed product names, and any failure or delay associated with such approval may adversely affect our business.\nWe assigned the trade names Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae to our now FDA-approved products. In 2019, the EC granted a centralised marketing authorisation for Rhopressa\u00ae, which will be marketed under the trade name Rhokiinsa\u00ae. Any other names we intend to use for our current or any future product candidates will require approval from the FDA and applicable non-U.S. regulatory authorities regardless of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the USPTO or applicable non-U.S. regulatory authorities. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of the potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA may also object to a product name if it believes the name inappropriately implies medical claims or contributes to an overstatement of efficacy. Regulatory authorities outside the United States conduct their own investigations. If the FDA or applicable non-U.S. authorities object to any of our proposed product names for any current or future product candidates, we may be required to adopt an alternative trade name. In 2018, the EMA approved the name Roclanda\u00ae for Rocklatan\u00ae in the EU. A trademark application for Roclanda\u00ae was filed in the EU on October 25, 2018, and this mark was successfully registered in the EU on March 4, 2019.\nIf we do not obtain additional protection under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and similar foreign legislation extending the terms of our patents and obtaining data exclusivity for Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae, Rhokiinsa\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA regulatory approval for Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any current or future product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited PTE under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. PTEs, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval by the FDA.\nThe application for PTE is subject to approval by the USPTO, in conjunction with the FDA. It takes at least six months to obtain approval of the application for PTE. A PTE application pursuant to 35 USC \u00a7156 (section 156) was filed February 8, 2018 seeking an extension of U.S. patent number 8,394,826 (the \u201c\u2018826 patent\u201d). The \u2018826 patent covers Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae, and is presently expected to expire November 20, 2030, though the date may be extended if the \u2018826 patent PTE application is granted. To date there have been two official substantive actions on the \u2018826 patent PTE application. On September 18, 2018 the USPTO confirmed that \u2018826 patent is eligible for PTE under section 156. On May 13, 2019 the FDA confirmed that Rhopressa\u00ae was subject to the required FDA approval and that the PTE application was filed timely. We expect the FDA and USPTO will complete the PTE application review in late 2020; however, it is not possible to predict with certainty when the PTE will become official, if at all.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\nWe depend upon our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain employees.\nOur future growth and success depend on our ability to recruit, retain, manage and motivate our employees. We are highly dependent on our senior management team and our scientific founders, as well as the other principal members of our management and scientific teams. Although we have formal employment agreements with our executive officers, these agreements do not prevent them from terminating their employment with us at any time. The loss of the services of any\nmember of our senior management or scientific team or the inability to hire or retain experienced management personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results.\nBecause of the specialized scientific and managerial nature of our business, we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. In particular, the loss of Vicente Anido, Jr., our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, Thomas A. Mitro, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Richard J. Rubino, our Chief Financial Officer, Casey C. Kopczynski, our Chief Scientific Officer, David A. Hollander, our Chief Research & Development Officer, John LaRocca, our General Counsel, or Kathleen McGinley, our Vice President of Human Resources and Corporate Services, could be detrimental to us if we cannot recruit suitable replacements in a timely manner. We do not currently carry \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on the lives of members of executive management. The competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field is intense. Due to this intense competition, we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nWe have increased the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing our growth.\nWe have increased the size of our organization. We have approximately 380 full-time employees as of December 31, 2019 compared to 353 full-time employees as of December 31, 2018, and may expand further as we scale-up our manufacturing plant in Ireland.\nOur growth has imposed significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate new employees. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any current or future product candidates, if approved, and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to:\n\u2022\nmanage our research programs, clinical trials and the regulatory process effectively;\n\u2022\nmanage the operation of our manufacturing plant and the manufacturing of Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae and any current or future product candidates for clinical and commercial use;\n\u2022\nintegrate current and additional management, administrative, financial, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nhire additional personnel necessary to effectively commercialize and manufacture Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any current or future product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022\ncontinue to develop and maintain our administrative, accounting and management information systems and controls; and\n\u2022\nhire and train additional qualified personnel.\nProduct candidates that we may acquire or develop in the future may be intended for patient populations that are large. In order to continue development and marketing of these product candidates, if approved, we would need to significantly expand our operations. Our staff, financial resources, systems, procedures or controls may be inadequate to support our operations and our management may be unable to manage successfully future market opportunities or our relationships with customers and other third parties.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading, which could significantly harm our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, provide accurate information to the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We adopted a code of conduct, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in\ncontrolling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions.\nVarious macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business and the results of our operations and financial condition, including changes in inflation, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and overall economic conditions and uncertainties, including those resulting from the current and future conditions in the global financial markets. For instance, if inflation or other factors were to significantly increase our business costs, it may not be feasible to pass through price increases to patients. Interest rates, the liquidity of the credit markets and the volatility of the capital markets could also affect the value of our investments and our ability to liquidate our investments in order to fund our operations.\nInterest rates and the ability to access credit markets could also adversely affect the ability of patients, payers and distributors to purchase, pay for and effectively distribute Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, if approved. Similarly, these macroeconomic factors could affect the ability of our contract manufacturers, sole-source or single-source suppliers, collaboration partners or licensees to remain in business or otherwise develop, manufacture or supply product. Failure by any of them to remain in business could affect our ability to manufacture Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, if approved, or develop additional product candidates or technologies.\nA significant portion of our revenue currently comes from a limited number of distributors, and any decrease in revenue from these distributors could harm our business.\nA significant portion of our revenue comes from a limited number of distributors. In the year ended December 31, 2019, three distributors represented approximately 36.5%, 33.3% and 28.0% of total revenues. We further expect that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to depend on sales to a limited number of distributors in the foreseeable future. We do not have long-term commitments from our distributors to carry our products, and any of our distributors may from quarter to quarter comprise a significant concentration of our revenues. Our dependence on a few distributors could expose us to the risk of substantial losses if any single large distributor stops purchasing our products, purchases a lower quantity of our products or goes out of business and we cannot find substitute distributors on equivalent terms without delays, if at all. While we may be able to shift our business to one of our other existing distributors or to a new distributor, there may be disruption in the interim. In addition, any reduction in the prices we receive for our products could adversely impact our revenues and financial condition. If we lose our relationship with any of our significant distributors, we could experience delays in the distribution of our products and could also experience declines in our revenues which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIf we engage in acquisitions or licenses in the future, we will incur a variety of costs and we may never realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or licenses.\nWe may attempt to acquire or license businesses, technologies, services, products or product candidates in the future that we believe are a strategic fit with our business. For example, in October 2017, we acquired the rights to use PRINT\u00ae technology and certain other assets from Envisia. Further, in August 2018 we entered into an Amended and Restated Collaborative Research, Development, and License Agreement with DSM, which provides for (i) a worldwide exclusive license for all ophthalmic indications to DSM\u2019s polyesteramide polymer technology, (ii) continuation of the collaborative research initiatives through the end of 2020, including the transfer of DSM\u2019s formulation technology to Aerie during that time and (iii) access to a preclinical latanoprost implant. Additionally, in late 2019 we acquired Avizorex, an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company developing therapeutics for the treatment of dry eye disease. We have no present agreement regarding any material acquisitions. However, if we do undertake any acquisitions or additional licenses, the process of integrating an acquired or licensed business, technology, service, product or product candidate into our business may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention from our core business. In addition, we may fail to retain key executives and employees of the companies we acquire, which may reduce the value of the acquisition or give rise to additional integration costs. Future acquisitions or licenses could result in additional issuances of equity securities that would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders. Future acquisitions or licenses could also result in the incurrence of debt, actual or contingent liabilities or the amortization of expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have limited experience identifying, negotiating and implementing acquisitions or licenses of additional businesses, technologies, services, products or product candidates, which is a lengthy and complex process. The market for acquiring or licensing businesses, technologies, services, products or product candidates is intensely competitive, and other companies,\nincluding some with substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, may also pursue strategies to acquire or license businesses, technologies, products or product candidates that we may consider attractive. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us.\nWe have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or licensing of additional businesses, technologies, services, products, or product candidates and integrate them into our current infrastructure. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. We may not be able to acquire or license the rights to additional businesses, technologies, services, products or product candidates on terms that we find acceptable, or at all. In particular, any product candidate that we acquire or license may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including extensive clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure typical of pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities.\nBusiness interruptions could delay the development of our potential products and our manufacturing activities, and could disrupt our potential sales.\nOur principal executive office and research facility is located in Durham, North Carolina, our regulatory, commercial support and other administrative activities are located in Irvine, California, and our clinical, finance and legal operations are located in Bedminster, New Jersey. We also lease space for a manufacturing plant in Athlone, Ireland and small offices in Malta, Ireland, the United Kingdom and Japan. We are vulnerable to natural disasters, such as severe storms, and other adverse events that could disrupt our operations. We carry limited insurance for natural disasters and other adverse events, and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures, cyber-attacks or other security breaches.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of our CROs, sales force, collaborators and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, malware, ransomware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer systems and, if successful, misappropriate our proprietary and confidential information including e-mails and other electronic communications. In addition, an employee, supplier, collaboration partner or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to obtain such information and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs, manufacturing activities and/or commercialization efforts, damage our reputation, provide competitors with valuable information and subject us to additional liabilities, including criminal penalties and civil sanctions. We have not been subject to cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents to date which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our business, but the actions we take to prevent or detect the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology networks and infrastructure may be insufficient to prevent or detect a major cyber-attack or other cyber incident in the future.\nIn addition, there is a risk created by our lack of redundancy across our systems and if any of these events were to occur, this could result in a loss of materials that would be difficult to replace, such as proprietary information including intellectual property and business information and/or customer, supplier, employee, business partner and, in certain instances, patient personally identifiable information. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties to manufacture Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae, and similar events relating to their systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the commercialization of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and the further development of any current or future product candidates could be delayed.\nOur actual or perceived failure to comply with U.S. federal, state, and foreign governmental regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection and information security could harm our reputation and business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information, data about our clinical participants, suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information. The secure storage, maintenance, and transmission of and access to this information is important to our operations and reputation. Any access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disruption of our operations and damage to our reputation, all of which could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, we are subject to various U.S. federal and state and international privacy and security regulations. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. In addition, many U.S. states have enacted comparable laws addressing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA. With our increasing international presence, we are also subject to the laws of jurisdictions outside the United States. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements, which could increase the costs incurred by us in complying with such laws.\nThe EU member states, Switzerland, Japan and other countries have established, or are in the process of establishing, legal frameworks for privacy and data security that impose significant compliance obligations with which our customers, our vendors or we must comply. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes strict requirements on data controllers and processors of personal data. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements, including requirements relating to processing sensitive data (including health, biometric and genetic information), obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. In addition, the GDPR grants individuals an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. Further, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU, including to the United States and other regions.\nThe GDPR introduced new fines and penalties for a breach of requirements, which may result in significant fines of up to 4% of annual global revenues, or \u20ac20.0 million, whichever is greater. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, in particular as regards data processing in the context of clinical trials. As a result of the implementation of the GDPR, we were required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new data protection rules, although there is a risk that the measures will not be implemented correctly or that individuals within our business will not be fully compliant with the new procedures. If there are any breaches of these measures, we could face significant administrative and monetary sanctions as well as reputational damage, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and our systems to implement such disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, our insurance may be inadequate and we may incur substantial liability.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability claims as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates. We face an additional risk from our commercial sales of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and will face further risk to the extent we commercialize any current or future product candidates, if approved. We maintain primary product liability insurance and excess product liability insurance that cover our clinical trials, and we have and plan to maintain insurance against product liability lawsuits for commercial sale of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any current or future product candidates, if approved. Historically, the potential liability associated with product liability lawsuits for pharmaceutical products has been unpredictable.\nAlthough we believe that our current insurance is a reasonable estimate of our potential liability and represents a commercially reasonable balancing of the level of coverage as compared to the cost of the insurance, we may be subject to claims in connection with our clinical trials or commercial use of Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, if approved, for which our insurance coverage may not be adequate, and the cost of any product liability litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial.\nFor example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, if approved. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nreduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ntermination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u2022\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs to defend resulting litigation;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe increased our insurance coverage when each of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae received FDA approval. However, the product liability insurance we will need to maintain in connection with the continued commercial sales of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any current or future product candidates if and when they receive regulatory approval, may be unavailable in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost. In addition, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive. If we are unable to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, it could inhibit the continued commercial production and sale of Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any current or future product candidates if and when they obtain regulatory approval, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nAdditionally, we do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. Some of the policies we currently maintain include general liability, employment practices liability, property, auto, workers\u2019 compensation, products liability and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance. We do not know, however, if we will be able to maintain insurance with adequate levels of coverage. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would materially adversely affect our financial position, cash flows and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.\nOur stock price has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile. The following factors, in addition to other factors described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022\nthe success of our commercial launch of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae in the United States, including associated sales volumes, revenues and profitability;\n\u2022\noverall company profitability and ability to generate positive cash flows, and elimination of the additional costs associated with financing overhang;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain adequate product supply to meet demand at an acceptable per unit cost;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain regulatory approval in jurisdictions outside the United States;\n\u2022\nthe results of our testing and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nannouncements of regulatory approval or a complete response letter, or specific label indications or patient populations for its use, or changes or delays in the regulatory review process;\n\u2022\nannouncements of therapeutic innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nadverse actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our clinical trials, manufacturing supply chain or sales and marketing activities;\n\u2022\nany adverse changes to our relationships with manufacturers, suppliers, licensees or collaboration partners;\n\u2022\nthe results of our efforts to develop, acquire or license additional product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022\nvariations in the level of expenses related to Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or preclinical and clinical development programs;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nany intellectual property infringement actions in which we may become involved;\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning our competitors or the pharmaceutical industry in general;\n\u2022\nactual versus expected product sales and profitability;\n\u2022\nmanufacture, supply or distribution shortages;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us, our executive officers and directors or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the capital markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles; and\n\u2022\nthe loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.\nIn addition, the stock market, in general, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Further, any decline in the financial markets and related factors beyond our control may cause our stock price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly.\nAny securities litigation could result in substantial damages and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business.\nA putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain of our officers and directors in 2015, which has now concluded. If our stock price experiences volatility, we may be the subject of additional securities litigation in the future. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely impact our business. Monitoring and defending against legal actions is time-consuming for our management and detracts from our ability to fully focus on our business activities. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nCertain of our existing stockholders, executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our common stock and may be able to influence or control matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\nOur officers and directors, and stockholders who own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, beneficially own approximately 48.6% of our common stock as of December 31, 2019. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in\ncompanies with ownership concentration. Some of our stockholders may be able to influence or determine matters requiring stockholder approval. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders.\nThis may also prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that other stockholders may feel are in their best interest, and certain of our existing stockholders may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nAdditionally, under certain circumstances, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation renounces any interest or expectancy that we have in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, corporate opportunities that are presented to certain entities or their affiliates and certain other related parties (whether or not any such person is our director). These provisions will apply even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they adversely change their recommendations or publish negative reports regarding our business or our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts and we cannot provide any assurance that analysts will continue to cover us or provide favorable coverage. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price could decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nBecause we do not intend to declare cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future, stockholders must rely on appreciation of the value of our common stock for any return on their investment.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, we expect that only appreciation of the price of our common stock, if any, will provide a return to investors for the foreseeable future.\nThe requirements associated with being a public company require significant company resources and management attention.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Global Market, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In addition, subsequent rules implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Global Market may also impose various additional requirements on public companies. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our corporate governance standards, disclosure controls and financial reporting and accounting systems to continue to meet our reporting obligations. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company, which could subject us to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nWe are subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d), which requires that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, among other additional requirements. Compliance with Section 404 is costly and time consuming for management and could result in the detection of internal control deficiencies. Moreover, if we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis, and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal\ncontrols over financial reporting, which could harm our operating results, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and cause the trading price of our common stock to fall. Any failure to file accurate and timely quarterly and annual reports that we are required to file with the SEC under the Exchange Act could result in sanctions, lawsuits, delisting of our shares from The Nasdaq Global Market or other adverse consequences that would materially harm our business.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nestablishing a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nallowing the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nlimiting the removal of directors by the stockholders;\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nrequiring the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal our bylaws.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our board of directors. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 14238, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "AERI"}
