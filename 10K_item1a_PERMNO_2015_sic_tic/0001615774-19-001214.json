RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the risk factors listed below. Risks and uncertainties in addition to those we describe below, that may not be presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also harm our business and operations in the future. If any of these risks occur, our business, and its future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed, the price of shares of our common stock could decline, and future events and circumstances could differ significantly from those expected that are set forth in or underlie the forward-looking statements contained in this report.\nDependence on our Chief Executive Officer.\nWe are dependent on the services of Mr. Clark A. Marcus, our Chief Executive Officer. The loss of his services would have a material adverse effect on the performance and growth of our business for some period of time. We do not have any \u201cKey Man\u201d insurance for Mr. Marcus.\nOur inability to renew, extend or replace expiring or terminated contracts in the near term could adversely affect our liquidity, profitability and financial condition.\nMany of the contracts we service could be terminated immediately either for cause or without cause by the client upon notice of a specified time (typically between 30 and 60 days). The loss of one of these contracts could materially reduce our net revenue and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, profitability and financial condition.\nA compromise of our information systems or unauthorized access to confidential information or our customers personal information could materially harm our business and/or our reputation.\nAn effective and secure information system, available at all times, is vital to our individual and corporate customers. We collect and store confidential medical and personal from our customers. Certain of the information we collect is Personnel Health Information as that term is defined under HIPPA. We depend on our computer systems for significant service and management functions, such as providing membership monitoring, utilization, processing customer information, and providing regulatory data and other client and managerial reports. Although our computer and communications hardware is protected by physical and software safeguards and other internal controls, it is still vulnerable to computer hacking which if successful, could cause such information to be misappropriated. We could be subject to liability for failure to comply with HIPPA or other privacy laws. Any compromise of our systems or data could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not have 100% redundancy for all of our computer operations.\nWe are subject to intense competition that may prevent us from gaining new customers or pricing our contracts at levels sufficient to achieve gross margins to ensure profitability.\nWe are continually pursuing new business. Many of our competitors are significantly larger and better capitalized than we are. Our smaller size and weak financial condition have been a deterrent to some prospective customers. One of the general ways in which testing is presently done for OSA is a \u201csleep center\u201d. These facilities are able to accept insurance. We are not presently credentialed to accept insurance. As a result, we may not be able to successfully compete in our industry in some respects.\n- 10 -\nFailure to adequately comply with HIPAA may result in penalties.\nOur industry is subject to the security and privacy requirements of HIPAA relative to patients\u2019 health information. Although we believe we are fully compliant with all HIPAA regulations, any assertions of lack of compliance with HIPAA regulations could result in penalties and have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain our customers or to gain new business.\nWe may require additional funding, and we cannot guarantee that we will find adequate sources of capital at acceptable terms in the future.\nOur available revenue from operations is not currently sufficient to fund our business. If we are unable to increase our revenue from operations, we may need to seek new financing, possibly in the form of additional debt or equity (which could dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership interests). We cannot provide assurance that such additional funding will be available on acceptable terms.\nRisks related to our common and preferred stock.\nOur Series C Convertible Preferred stockholders have significant rights and preferences over the holders of our common stock and may be deemed to operate as an anti-takeover device.\nOur Series C Convertible Preferred stockholders are entitled to receive dividends when declared by our Board of Directors before dividends are paid on our common stock and also have a claim against our assets senior to the claim of the holders of our common stock in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up. The aggregate amount of that senior claim is currently $2,608,500. In addition, each Series C Convertible Preferred stockholder is entitled to vote together with the holders of our common stock on an \u201cas converted\u201d basis, and, voting together as a separate class, all holders have the right to elect five of our nine directors to our Board of Directors. The holders by their ability to control a majority of our Directors may be deemed to be an anti-takeover device.\nThe holders of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock have other rights and preferences as detailed elsewhere in this report. These rights and preferences could adversely affect our ability to finance future operations, satisfy capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest.\nOur Series D Convertible Preferred stockholders have significant rights and preferences over the holders of our common stock and may be deemed to operate as an anti-takeover device.\nWe also have a class of convertible preferred stock, Series D, for which 7,000 shares are authorized and 250 shares have been issued. Subject to certain conditions, the shares do not vest until the tenth anniversary of the grant date of January 4, 2012, at which time each share will be convertible into 100,000 shares of common stock. Prior to vesting and thereafter, each Series D convertible preferred share is entitled to all voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights accorded a share of Series D convertible preferred stock. If a dividend is declared on the common stock, each share of Series D stock is entitled to receive a dividend equal to 50% of the dividend declared for the common stock as if the Series D stock had been converted. Despite their nonvested status, voting rights of each share nevertheless consist of the right to cast the number of votes equal to those of 500,000 shares of common stock. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, holders of shares of Series D have the right to vote together with holders of common stock as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The holders by virtue of their superior voting rights may be deemed to operate as an anti-takeover device.\n- 11 -\nThe holders of our Series D Preferred Stock may be deemed to control the Company as they have the ability to elect a majority of the members of the Board of Directors.\nWe may raise additional funds in the future through issuances of securities and such additional funding may be dilutive to stockholders or impose operational restrictions.\nTo fund our operations, repay our existing debt and grow our business we may raise additional capital in the future through sales of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock or through debt. Such additional financing may be dilutive to our stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve significant interest costs and/or restrictive covenants which may limit our operating flexibility.\nApplicable SEC rules governing the trading of \u201cpenny stocks\u201d may limit the trading and liquidity of our common stock which, along with our small public capitalization may affect the trading price of our common stock and may subject us to securities litigation.\nOur common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d as defined under Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act and is accordingly subject to SEC rules and regulations that impose limitations upon the manner in which our common stock may be publicly traded. These regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the associated risks. Under these regulations, certain brokers who recommend such securities to persons other than established customers or certain accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination regarding such a purchaser and receive such purchaser\u2019s written agreement to a transaction prior to sale. These regulations may have the effect of limiting the trading activity of our common stock and reducing the liquidity of an investment in our common stock. In addition, the size of our public market capitalization is relatively small, resulting in highly limited trading volume in, and high volatility in the price of, our common stock.", "PERMNO": 25583, "SIC": 6324, "TIC": "CHCR"}
