RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties, along with the other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. If any of the following events actually occur, our business, financial condition and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or currently believe are not material may also adversely affect our business and operations.\nSee \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nThe airline industry is heavily regulated and failure to comply with applicable laws could reduce our sales, or require us to incur additional costs to achieve compliance, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe FAA prescribes standards and licensing requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation cabin interior products and licenses component repair stations within the United States. Comparable agencies, such as the EASA, the CAAC and the JCAB, regulate these matters in other countries. If we fail to obtain a required license for one of our products or services or lose a license previously granted, the sale of the subject product or service would be prohibited by law until such license is obtained, reinstated or renewed. In addition, designing new products to meet existing regulatory requirements and retrofitting installed products to comply with new regulatory requirements can be both expensive and time consuming.\nFrom time to time, these regulatory agencies propose new regulations. These new regulations generally cause an increase in costs to comply with these regulations. For example, the FAA dynamic testing requirements originally established in 1988 under 14 CFR 25.562 are currently required for certain new generation aircraft types. The enactment of 14 CFR 121.311(j) will require dynamic testing of all seats installed in all new aircraft produced after October 27, 2009. The EASA is expected to establish a similar rule. Compliance with this rule may require industry participants to expand engineering, plant and equipment to ensure that all products meet this rule. Smaller seating companies may not have the resources, financial or otherwise, to comply with this rule and may be required to sell their business or cease operations. To the extent the FAA implements rule changes in the future, we may incur additional costs to achieve compliance.\nThe airline industry is subject to extensive health, safety and environmental regulations, any violation of which could subject us to significant liabilities and penalties.\nWe are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and foreign laws and regulations establishing health, safety and environmental quality standards, and may be subject to liabilities or penalties for violations of those standards. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing remediation of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us or to which we have sent hazardous substances or waste for treatment, recycling or disposal. We may be subject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations. In addition, we may have liabilities or obligations in the future if we discover any environmental contamination or liability at any of our facilities, or at facilities we may acquire.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe are directly dependent upon the conditions in the airline and business jet industries and a continued economic downturn could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough the economy has exhibited signs of recovery, global financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption, which, at times, reached unprecedented levels as a result of the financial\ncrisis affecting the banking system and participants in the global financial markets. Concerns over the tightening of the corporate credit markets, inflation, energy costs and the dislocation of the residential real estate and mortgage markets have contributed to the volatility in the global financial markets and, together with the global financial crisis, have created uncertainties for global economic conditions in the future. The airline and business jet industries are sensitive to changes in economic conditions. In 2008 and 2009, the airline industry parked aircraft, delayed new aircraft purchases and deliveries of new aircraft, deferred retrofit programs and depleted existing inventories. The business jet industry was also severely impacted by both the recession and by declining corporate profits.\nUnfavorable economic conditions have also caused reduced spending for both leisure and business travel, which has negatively affected the airline and business jet industries. According to IATA, the economic downturn, combined with the high fuel prices experienced during most of 2009, contributed to the worldwide airline industry\u2019s loss of approximately $4.6 billion in 2009. In addition, as a result of the decline in both traffic and airfares following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and threats of future terrorist attacks, SARS and H1N1 outbreaks, the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as other factors, such as increases in fuel costs and heightened competition from low-cost carriers, the world airline industry lost a total of approximately $52.8 billion during the period from 2001 to 2009, which caused a significant number of airlines worldwide to declare bankruptcy or cease operations during this period.\nWhile the global airline industry has experienced a significant rebound, generating profits of approximately $10.6 billion in 2013 and an estimated $19.9 billion in 2014, due to a number of factors beyond our control, the commercial and business jet industries could experience a difficult operating environment. As an example, the operating environment would be negatively impacted by increasing fuel prices, consolidation in the industry, changes in regulation, terrorism, safety, environmental and health concerns and labor issues. Many of these factors could have a negative impact on air travel, which could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may be materially adversely affected by high fuel prices.\nFluctuations in the global supply of crude oil and the possibility of changes in government policy on jet fuel production, transportation and marketing make it impossible to predict the future availability and price of jet fuel. In the event there is an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other conflicts or significant disruptions in oil production or delivery in oil-producing areas or elsewhere, there could be reductions in the production or importation of crude oil and significant increases in the cost of jet fuel. If there were major reductions in the availability of jet fuel or significant increases in its cost, commercial airlines will face increased operating costs. Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry, airlines are often unable to pass on future increases in fuel prices to customers by increasing fares. As a result, an increase in jet fuel could result in a decrease in net income from either lower margins or, if airlines increase ticket fares, less revenue from reduced airline travel. Decreases in airline profitability could decrease the demand for new commercial aircraft, resulting in delays of or reductions in deliveries of commercial aircraft equipped with our cabin interior products and, as a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe operate in cyclical industries and a continued economic downturn could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in cyclical industries. During periods of economic expansion, when capital spending normally increases, the Company generally benefits from greater demand for its products. During periods of economic contraction, when capital spending normally decreases, we generally are adversely affected by declining demand for our products and services. The impact of declining demand can be exacerbated by oversupply built during periods of expansion as there is a lag in suppliers\u2019 reactions to contraction. Industry conditions are impacted by numerous factors over which we have no control, including political, regulatory, economic and military conditions, environmental concerns, weather conditions and fuel pricing. Any prolonged cyclical downturn could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nThere are risks inherent in international operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nWhile the majority of our operations are based domestically, we have significant manufacturing operations based internationally with facilities in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and the Philippines. In addition, we sell our products to airlines all over the world. Our customers are located primarily in North America, Europe, Asia, the Pacific Rim, South America and the Middle East. As a result, 67% and 64% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were to customers located outside the United States. Volatile international economic, political and market conditions may have a negative impact on our operating results and our ability to achieve our goals.\nIn addition, we have a number of subsidiaries in foreign countries (primarily in Europe), which have sales outside the United States. As a result, we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations as a portion of our net sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Approximately 40% and 40% of our sales during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, came from our foreign operations. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies affect the dollar value of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, with these fluctuations being included in a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity. At December 31, 2014, we reported a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment of approximately $105.4 million in stockholders\u2019 equity as a result of foreign currency adjustments, and we may incur additional adjustments in future periods. In addition, operating results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars for purposes of our statement of operations at average monthly exchange rates. Moreover, to the extent that our revenues are not denominated in the same currency as our expenses, our net earnings could be materially adversely affected. For example, a portion of labor, material and overhead costs for goods produced in our production facilities in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and the Philippines are incurred in British pounds, Euros or Philippine pesos, but the related sales revenues are generally denominated in U.S. dollars. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar or other currencies could result in material fluctuations in foreign currency translation amounts or the U.S. dollar value of transactions and, as a result, our net earnings could be materially adversely affected.\nHistorically we have not engaged in hedging transactions. However, we may engage in hedging transactions in the future to manage or reduce our foreign exchange risk. Our attempts to manage our foreign currency exchange risk may not be successful and, as a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur foreign operations could also be subject to unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other market barriers and political, economic and social instability in the countries where we operate or sell our products and offer our services. The impact of any such events that may occur in the future could subject us to additional costs or loss of sales, which could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks associated with the sale of our products and services to the U.S. Government, which could negatively affect our revenues and results of operations.\nAs a supplier directly to the defense industry and as a subcontractor to suppliers of the U.S. Government, we face risks that are specific to doing business with the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government has the ability to unilaterally suspend the award of new contracts to us in the event of any violations of procurement laws, or reviews of the same. It could also reduce the value of our existing contracts as well as audit our costs and fees. Many of our U.S. Government contracts may be terminated for convenience by the government. Termination-for-convenience provisions typically provide that we would recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on the work that we completed prior to termination. In such an event, we would not earn the revenue that we would have originally anticipated from such a terminated contract.\nGovernment reviews can be costly and time consuming, and could divert our management resources away from running our business. As a result of such reviews, we could be required to provide a refund to the\nU.S. Government or we could be asked to enter into an arrangement whereby our prices would be based on cost, or the U.S. Government could seek to pursue alternative sources of supply for our products. These actions could have a negative effect on our management efficiency and could reduce our revenues and results of operations. Additionally, as a U.S. Government contractor or subcontractor, we are subject to federal laws governing suppliers to the U.S. Government, including potential application of the False Claims Act.\nIf we make acquisitions, they may be less successful than we expect, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe have made many acquisitions in the past. We may also consider future acquisitions, some of which could be material to us. We explore and conduct discussions with many third parties regarding possible acquisitions. Our ability to continue to achieve our goals may depend upon our ability to effectively identify attractive businesses, access financing sources on acceptable terms, negotiate favorable transaction terms and successfully consummate and integrate any businesses we acquire, achieve cost efficiencies and manage these businesses as part of our Company.\nOur acquisition activities may involve unanticipated delays, costs and other problems. If we encounter unanticipated problems with one of our acquisitions, our senior management may be required to divert attention away from other aspects of our business. Additionally, we may fail to consummate proposed acquisitions or divestitures, after incurring expenses and devoting substantial resources, including management time, to such transactions. Acquisitions also pose the risk that we may be exposed to successor liability relating to actions by an acquired company and its management before the acquisition. The due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition, and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies, may not be sufficient to protect us from, or compensate us for, actual liabilities. Additionally, depending upon the acquisition opportunities available, we also may need to raise additional funds through the capital markets or arrange for additional bank financing in order to consummate such acquisitions or to fund capital expenditures necessary to integrate the acquired business. We also may not be able to raise the substantial capital required for acquisitions and integrations on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nWe may be unable to effectively and efficiently manage our inventories as we expand our business, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe have substantially expanded the size, scope and nature of our business through acquisitions and organic means, resulting in an increase in the breadth of our product offerings and an expansion of our business geographically. Business expansion places increasing demands on us to increase the inventories that we carry. We must anticipate demand well out into the future in order to service our extensive customer base. The inability to effectively and efficiently manage our inventories to meet current and future needs of our customers, which may vary widely from what is originally forecast due to a number of factors beyond our control, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased leverage could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe may incur additional debt under our current revolving credit facility or through new borrowings to finance our operations or for future growth, including funding acquisitions. A high degree of leverage could have important consequences to us. For example, it could:\n\u00b7\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate purposes or acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged; and\n\u00b7\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry.\nThe failure of our suppliers to perform to our requirements could negatively impact our results of operations, including our profit margins.\nWe depend on manufacturing firms to support our operations through the timely supply of products. Our suppliers may experience capacity constraints that may result in their inability to supply us with products in a timely fashion, with adequate quantities or at a desired price. Factors affecting the manufacturing sector can include labor disputes, general economic issues, and changes in raw material and energy costs. Natural disasters such as earthquakes or hurricanes, as well as political instability and terrorist activities, may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of our suppliers as well. These factors could lead to increased prices for our inventory, curtailment of supplies and the unfavorable allocation of product by our suppliers, which could reduce our revenues and profit margins and harm our customer relations. Significant disruptions in our supply chain could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur total assets include substantial intangible assets. The write-off of a significant portion of intangible assets would negatively affect our reported financial results.\nOur total assets reflect substantial intangible assets. At December 31, 2014, goodwill and identified intangibles, net, represented approximately 34% of our total assets. Intangible assets consist principally of goodwill and other identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives. If the carrying value of the tested asset exceeds its estimated fair value, impairment is deemed to have occurred. In this event, the amount is written down to fair value. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, this would result in a charge to operating earnings. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized identified intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, which could be material. We also performed our annual testing of impairment of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014. There was no impairment recorded in 2012, 2013 or 2014. As of December 31, 2014, the balances of goodwill and intangible assets were $859.5 million and $218.2 million, respectively.\nWe have a significant backlog that may be deferred or may not be entirely realized.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $3.0 billion of booked backlog. Given the nature of our industry and customers, there is a risk that orders forming part of our backlog may be cancelled or deferred due to economic conditions or fluctuations in our customers\u2019 business needs, purchasing budgets or inventory management practices.\nA significant portion of our backlog includes SFE programs with Boeing and Airbus, which makes us particularly vulnerable to their businesses and continued production of various airplane models. For example, at December 31, 2008, while no major retrofit programs were cancelled, several large retrofit programs that were scheduled for delivery in 2009 were deferred until 2010 and 2011, which negatively impacted our revenues and profits for 2009. Failure to realize sales from our existing or future backlog would negatively impact our financial results.\nWe have significant financial and operating restrictions in our debt instruments that may have an adverse effect on our operations.\nThe credit agreement governing our senior secured bank credit facilities (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) contains numerous financial, operating and/or negative covenants that may limit our ability to incur additional or repay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to make certain payments and investments, including dividend payments, to repurchase shares, to engage in transactions with affiliates, to engage in sale/leaseback transactions, to guarantee indebtedness and to sell or otherwise dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. Agreements governing future indebtedness could also contain significant financial and operating restrictions. A failure to comply with the obligations contained in any current or future agreement governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default under our current or any future credit facility, or any future indenture or agreements governing our debt securities that we may issue, which could permit acceleration of the related debt and acceleration of debt under other instruments that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions. We may not have, or may not be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make any required accelerated payments.\nOur operations rely on an extensive network of information technology resources and a failure to maintain, upgrade and protect such systems could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInformation technology plays a crucial role in all of our operations. To remain competitive, our hardware, software and related services must interact with our suppliers and customers efficiently, record and process our financial transactions accurately, and obtain the data and information to enable the analysis of trends and plans and the execution of our strategies.\nThe failure or unavailability of our information technology systems could directly impact our ability to interact with our customers and provide them with products and services when needed. Such failure to properly supply or service our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our customer relationships could be damaged well beyond the period of the downtime of our information technology systems.\nWe compete with a number of established companies, some of which have significantly greater financial, technological and marketing resources than we do, and we may not be able to compete effectively with these companies.\nWe compete with numerous established companies. Some of these companies have significantly greater financial, technological and marketing resources than we do. Our ability to be a successful competitor depends on our success in causing our products and the new products we may develop to be selected for installation in new aircraft, including next-generation aircraft, and in avoiding product obsolescence. It will also depend on our ability to remain the supplier of retrofit and refurbishment products and spare parts on the commercial fleets on which our products are currently in service. Developing and maintaining a competitive advantage may require continued investment in product development, engineering, supply-chain management and sales and marketing, and we may not have enough resources to make such investments, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe incur risks associated with new programs.\nNew programs with new technologies typically carry risks associated with design changes, development of new production tools, increased capital and funding commitments, ability to meet customer specifications, delivery schedules and unique contractual requirements, supplier performance, ability of the customer to meet its contractual obligations to us, and our ability to accurately estimate costs associated with such programs. In addition, any new program may not generate sufficient demand or may experience technological problems or significant delays in regulatory or other certification or manufacturing and delivery schedules. If we were unable to perform our obligations under new programs to the customer\u2019s satisfaction, if we were unable to\nmanufacture products at our estimated costs, or if a new program in which we had made a significant investment was terminated or experienced weak demand, certification or other delays or technological problems, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to retain personnel who are key to our operations.\nOur success, among other things, is dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified senior management and other key personnel. Competition for key personnel is intense, and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent. The inability to hire, develop and retain these key employees may adversely affect our operations.\nProvisions in our charter documents may discourage potential acquisitions of our Company, even those which the holders of a majority of our common stock may favor.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an unsolicited acquisition of us by means of a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws:\n\u00b7\nclassify the Board of Directors into three classes, with directors of each class serving for a staggered three-year period;\n\u00b7\nprovide that directors may be removed only for cause and only upon the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of our shares entitled to vote generally in the election of such directors;\n\u00b7\nrequire at least two-thirds of the voting power of our shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors to alter, amend or repeal the provisions relating to the classified board and removal of directors described above;\n\u00b7\npermit only existing members of the Board of Directors to fill vacancies and newly created directorships on the board;\n\u00b7\nprovide that only the existing members of the Board of Directors may change the number of directors on the Board of Directors;\n\u00b7\nrestrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings; and\n\u00b7\ncontain advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals.\nThere can be no assurance that we will pay cash dividends or that we will repurchase shares.\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy that contemplates the payment of cash dividends and a share repurchase program. Whether, when and in what amounts we in fact pay such dividends or repurchase our shares remains entirely at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our future earnings, capital requirements, financial conditions, operating conditions, contractual restrictions, including those restrictions in our Credit Agreement and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. All of these factors and their evaluation by our Board of Directors, as well as the dividend policy itself and the share repurchase program, are subject to change. Our ability to repurchase our shares may also be affected by our share price and by blackout periods during which we may refrain from repurchasing our shares. Our dividend payments and/or share repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will pay dividends or repurchase shares in any particular amounts or at all. If we do not pay cash dividends in accordance with the policy or repurchase shares under the program, this could have a negative effect on our share price.\nIf the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders could incur substantial losses of any investment in our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock is subject to sudden and material increases and decreases, and decreases could adversely affect investments in our common stock. For example from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, the sale price of our common stock fluctuated between $50.08 and $73.21; adjusted to reflect the spin-off of KLX. The price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to:\n\u00b7\nour quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our business;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the market\u2019s perception of our business;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the businesses, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors or customers;\n\u00b7\nchanges in airline industry or business jet industry conditions;\n\u00b7\ndelays in new aircraft certification, production or order rates;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our key personnel;\n\u00b7\nchanges in general market or economic conditions; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in the legislative or regulatory environment.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our Company, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price.\nWe have grown, and may continue to grow, at a rapid pace. Our inability to properly manage or support the growth may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods and intend to continue to grow our business both through acquisitions and internal expansion of products and services. Our growth to date has placed, and could continue to place, significant demands on our management team and our operational, administrative and financial resources. We may not be able to grow effectively or manage our growth successfully, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Relating to our Spin-Off of KLX\nThere could be significant liability if the distribution of KLX common stock to our stockholders is determined to be a taxable transaction.\nWe received an opinion from tax counsel to the effect that, among other things, the separation and distribution of KLX qualifies as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections\n355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations, undertakings and covenants from us and KLX regarding the past and future conduct of ours and KLX\u2019s respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, undertakings or covenants is incorrect or not satisfied, the opinion of tax counsel may no longer be valid.\nIn addition, notwithstanding the receipt by us of the opinion of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the separation and distribution of KLX is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations, undertakings or covenants is not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or KLX. If the distribution of KLX common stock is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would be subject to tax as if we had sold the KLX common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our stockholders that received KLX common stock in the distribution generally would be treated as having received a taxable dividend in an amount equal to the fair market value of the KLX common stock. The resulting U.S. federal income tax liabilities of us and such stockholders could be significant.\nUnder the Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement between KLX and us, KLX generally is required to indemnify us against (i) any taxes imposed on us with respect to the distribution of KLX common stock to the extent that such taxes result from certain events with respect to KLX, and (ii) a portion, based on the relative trading prices of our common stock and KLX common stock during the period shortly after the distribution, of any taxes imposed on us with respect to the distribution of KLX common stock if the distribution fails to qualify as a tax-free transaction for reasons other than those for which KLX or us would be responsible for pursuant to the Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement.\nThe U.S. federal income tax rules applicable to the distribution of the KLX common stock may restrict us from engaging in certain corporate transactions or from raising equity capital beyond certain thresholds for a period of time after the distribution.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment of the distribution of KLX common stock to us and our stockholders, under the Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement, for the two-year period following the separation and distribution of KLX, we are subject to certain restrictions with respect to our activities, including restrictions relating to certain issuances or repurchases of our common stock (except for repurchases in compliance with published IRS guidelines for tax-free spin-offs), acquisitions and mergers, and asset sales.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability during such two-year period to pursue strategic transactions of a certain magnitude that involve the issuance or acquisition of our common stock or engage in other transactions that might increase the value of our business.\nA court could require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to KLX under the Separation and Distribution Agreement.\nUnder the Separation and Distribution Agreement, from and after the spin-off, the Company and\nKLX are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which it owns and operates following the consummation of the spin-off. Although we do not expect to be liable for any obligations that are not allocated to us under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, a court could disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to KLX (including, for example, environmental liabilities), particularly if KLX were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the allocated obligations.\nCertain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their current positions with KLX or their ownership of KLX equity.\nCertain of our directors are directors or officers of KLX and thus have professional relationships with KLX\u2019s executive officers and directors. Three of our directors, including our Executive Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors, serve on the Board of Directors of KLX. Our Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors also serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of KLX and as its Chief Executive Officer. In addition, several of our directors have a financial interest in KLX as a result of their ownership of KLX stock and restricted stock. These relationships and financial interests may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors face decisions that could have different implications for KLX than for us.", "PERMNO": 76138, "SIC": 2531, "TIC": "BEAV"}
