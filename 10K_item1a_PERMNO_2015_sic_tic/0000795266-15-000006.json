These factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking and other statements that (a) we make in registration statements, periodic reports and other filings with the SEC and from time to time in our news releases, annual reports and other written reports or communications, (b) we post on or make available through our primary website at www.kbhome.com or our investor relations website at http://\ninvestor.kbhome.com and/or through other electronic channels, including social media outlets and other evolving communication technologies, and (c) our personnel and representatives make orally from time to time.\nThe generally favorable conditions of the present housing recovery may not continue, and any weakening or reversal of these conditions generally, or in our served markets or for the homebuilding industry, may materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2014, the housing market continued to improve compared to the several difficult years of the housing downturn. The present recovery, which began to take shape in 2012, has been driven primarily by steady demand for homes, fairly low inventories of homes available for sale and generally healthy economic and demographic factors. Housing demand has been supported by population and household formation growth, as well as affordability largely due to relatively low mortgage loan interest rates, and positive consumer confidence. However, the performance of individual housing markets varied throughout the year, with home sales activity and selling price appreciation robust in certain markets and tempered in others due to, among other things, rising housing prices and/or inventory levels.\nWe expect that such unevenness in housing market conditions will continue in 2015 and beyond whether or not the present housing recovery progresses, and that prevailing conditions in various housing markets and submarkets will fluctuate. These fluctuations may be significant and unfavorable in 2015 and future periods, and may include a softening or sustained deterioration of home sales activity and/or selling prices, and could be more pronounced in our served markets. In addition, while some of the negative factors that contributed to the housing downturn may have subsided, several remain, and they could return and/or intensify to inhibit any future improvement in housing market conditions in 2015 and beyond. These negative factors include:\n\u2022\nweak general economic, income and employment growth;\n\u2022\nhigh consumer debt levels, including elevated student loan balances;\n\u2022\ndelinquencies, defaults and foreclosures on mortgage loans;\n\u2022\nhomeowners whose outstanding principal balance on their mortgage loan exceeds the market value of their home;\n\u2022\nvolatility and uncertainty in domestic and international financial, credit and consumer lending markets; and\n\u2022\ntight lending standards and practices for mortgage loans that limit consumers\u2019 ability to qualify for mortgage financing to purchase a home.\nAdditional headwinds may come from the efforts and proposals of lawmakers to reduce the debt of the federal government through tax increases and/or spending cuts, or the failure of lawmakers to timely agree on a budget or appropriation legislation to fund the operations of the federal government, and financial markets\u2019 and businesses\u2019 reactions to those efforts, proposals or failure, which could impair economic growth. Since these factors may persist or recur, we can provide no assurance that the present housing recovery will continue or gain further momentum, whether overall or in our served markets.\nIf, on an overall basis or in our served markets, the housing environment becomes more challenging; home sales or selling prices do not continue to advance at the same pace as in recent years or decline; any or all of the negative factors described above persist or worsen, particularly if there is limited economic growth or a decline, or low growth or decreases in employment and consumer incomes; housing affordability diminishes; and/or mortgage lending standards and practices remain tight or become more restrictive, there would likely be a corresponding adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial statements, including, but not limited to, the number of homes we deliver, our average selling prices, the amount of revenues we generate, our housing gross profit margins and our ability to operate profitably, and the effect may be material. In addition, due to a combination of continued rising direct construction cost pressures, reduced operating leverage from staffing to meet projected future community count and sales growth during 2015, an anticipated shift in our home delivery mix towards lower margin communities and selling price compression from, among other things, pricing adjustments and/or greater use of sales incentives to meet stiffening competition and softening demand at higher price points in certain submarkets, we anticipate that our housing gross profit margin in the first quarter of 2015 will decline significantly on a year-over-year and a sequential basis.\nContinued or additional tightening of mortgage lending standards and practices or mortgage financing requirements or volatility in financial, credit and consumer lending markets could adversely affect the availability of mortgage loans for potential purchasers of our homes and thereby reduce our net orders.\nAlthough there has been some improvement amid a general lift in housing prices over the past three years, the mortgage lending and mortgage finance industries have experienced significant instability due to, among other things, relatively high rates of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures on mortgage loans and fluctuations in their market value and the market value of\nsecurities backed by such loans. As a result, it is generally more difficult for some categories of borrowers to finance the purchase of homes, causing volatility in and elevating cancellation rates for us and other homebuilders, and reducing demand for homes, including our homes. If these factors continue, or if mortgage lending standards and practices further tighten, we expect that there would be a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial statements, particularly since we depend on lenders (including HCM) to provide mortgage loans to our homebuyers.\nFurther tightening of mortgage lending standards and practices and/or reduced credit availability for mortgages may also result from the implementation or enforcement of regulations under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d). Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act established several requirements relating to the origination, securitizing and servicing of, and consumer disclosures for, mortgage loans. In addition, U.S. and international banking regulators have enacted higher capital standards and requirements for financial institutions. These standards and requirements, as and when implemented or enforced, may further reduce the availability of and/or increase the costs to borrowers to obtain mortgage loans. If, due to standards or requirements related to the Dodd-Frank Act or other laws, or other factors or business decisions, mortgage lenders refuse or are unable to provide mortgage loans to our homebuyers, the number of homes we deliver and our consolidated financial statements may be materially and adversely affected. We can provide no assurance as to HCM\u2019s ability or willingness to provide mortgage loans and other mortgage banking services to our homebuyers in future periods or as to its performance in doing so.\nFederal regulators and lawmakers have also considered steps that may significantly reduce the ability or authority of the Federal Housing Administration (\u201cFHA\u201d), the Federal National Mortgage Association (also known as \u201cFannie Mae\u201d) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (also known as \u201cFreddie Mac\u201d) to purchase or insure mortgage loans under their respective programs. Further, lenders and other mortgage banking services providers, brokers and other institutions, and their agents, have been under intense regulatory scrutiny regarding mortgage loan underwriting practices and/or representations and warranties made in connection with selling mortgage loans into private or Fannie Mae- or Freddie Mac-backed securitized pools. If such scrutiny causes lenders and other mortgage banking services providers and brokers to adjust their operations and/or pay significant amounts in damages or fines, they may restrict or cease their mortgage loan origination activities due to reduced liquidity or to mitigate perceived risks. They may also take such steps based on the prospect of continued or additional scrutiny.\nThe mortgage banking operations of HCM are heavily regulated and subject to the rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and quasi-governmental agencies. If Nationstar decides to end, or we decide to terminate, our relationship with respect to HCM or otherwise, or there is a finding that Nationstar or HCM materially violated any applicable rules or regulations and as a result is restricted from or unable to originate mortgage loans, our customers may experience significant mortgage loan funding issues, which could lower our net orders and revenues, and, in turn, have a material adverse impact on our business and our consolidated financial statements. In addition, while substantially all of the mortgage loans originated by HCM are sold within a short period of time in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non-recourse basis, HCM remains potentially responsible for certain limited representations and warranties it makes in connection with such mortgage loan sales. Mortgage investors, including the FHA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, could in the future seek to have HCM buy back mortgage loans or compensate them for losses incurred on mortgage loans HCM has sold based on claims that it breached its limited representations or warranties. HCM has established reserves for potential losses. However, there can be no assurance that HCM will not have significant liabilities with respect to such claims in the future, which could exceed its reserves, or that the impact of such claims will not be material to HCM\u2019s financial condition or ability to operate, or cause us to recognize losses with respect to our equity interest in HCM, or cause our customers to seek mortgage loans from other lenders and/or experience mortgage loan funding issues that could delay our delivering homes to them and/or cause them to cancel their home purchase contracts with us.\nInterest rate increases or changes in federal lending programs or regulations could lower demand for our homes.\nA large percentage of our customers finance the purchase of their homes. Increases in interest rates, which the Federal Reserve may begin to implement in 2015, and/or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing or of certain mortgage loan products or programs may lead to fewer mortgage loans being provided, higher credit risk/mortgage loan insurance premiums and/or other fees, increased down payment and extensive buyer income and asset documentation requirements, or a combination of the foregoing, and, as a result, reduce demand for our homes and increase our cancellation rates.\nDue to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets and in the mortgage lending and mortgage finance industries, the federal government has taken on a significant role in supporting mortgage lending through its conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and its insurance of mortgage loans through the FHA and the Veterans Administration (\u201cVA\u201d). FHA backing of mortgage loans has been particularly important to the mortgage finance industry and to our business. The availability and affordability of mortgage loans, including interest rates and/or costs for such loans, could be adversely affected by a scaling back, tightening or termination of the federal government\u2019s mortgage loan-related programs or policies. In addition, given growing federal budget deficits, the U.S. Treasury may not be able to continue, or may be required by future legislation or regulation to cease, supporting the mortgage loan-related activities of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the FHA and the VA at present levels.\nBecause Fannie Mae-, Freddie Mac-, FHA- and VA-backed mortgage loans have been an important factor in marketing and selling many of our homes, any limitations or restrictions in the availability of, or higher consumer costs for, such government-backed financing could reduce our net orders, particularly in our coastal submarkets in California, and adversely affect our business and consolidated financial statements, and the effect could be material.\nThird-party lenders may not complete mortgage loan originations for our homebuyers in a timely manner or at all, which can lead to cancellations and a lower backlog of orders, or to significant delays in our delivering homes and recognizing revenues from those homes.\nOur homebuyers may obtain mortgage financing for their home purchases from any lender or other provider of their choice, including HCM. If, due to credit or consumer lending market conditions, reduced liquidity, increased risk retention or minimum capital level obligations and/or regulatory restrictions related to the Dodd-Frank Act or other laws, or other factors or business decisions, these lenders refuse or are unable to provide mortgage loans to our homebuyers, the number of homes we deliver, our business and consolidated financial statements may be materially and adversely affected.\nCompared to other lenders, Nationstar, when it was our preferred mortgage lender, and subsequently HCM, which launched its operations in July 2014, have been providing more consistent execution and completion of mortgage loan originations for our homebuyers who chose to use them. Based on the number of homes delivered in 2014, approximately 62% of our homebuyers used HCM or Nationstar to finance the purchase of their home. Although we expect an increasing percentage of our homebuyers will choose to use HCM, many of our homebuyers will continue to seek mortgage loans from other lenders and potentially be subject to the performance of such lenders, as well as the general mortgage financing industry issues described above. We can provide no assurance as to other lenders\u2019 ability or willingness to complete, in a timely fashion or at all, the mortgage loan originations they start for our homebuyers. Such inability or unwillingness may result in mortgage loan funding issues and/or cancellations, which would likely have an material adverse affect on our business and consolidated financial statements.\nOur current strategies may not generate improved financial and operational performance, and the continued implementation of these and other strategies may not be successful.\nWe believe our current strategies and initiatives will enable us to profitably grow our business in 2015. However, our strategic and operational actions, including, but not limited to, our plans to open more new home communities for sales, increase the value of our net orders at our communities and improve our asset, organizational and production efficiencies and returns, may prove to be unsuitable for some or all of our served markets. We can provide no guarantee that our strategies, initiatives or actions will be successful, that they will generate growth or earnings or returns at any level or within any time frame, or that we will achieve in 2015 or beyond positive operational or financial results or results in any particular metric or measure equal to or better than our 2014 performance, or perform in any period as well as other homebuilders. In addition, we can provide no assurance that our new home community locations and products (or any refining of our products) will successfully attract consumers, command selling prices, or generate orders, revenues and/or housing gross profit margins at the levels we have experienced in the past or anticipate in future periods, at levels sufficient for us to be profitable or at levels higher than other homebuilders. We also cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to maintain these strategies, initiatives or actions in 2015 and, due to unexpectedly favorable or unfavorable market conditions or other factors, we may determine that we need to adjust, refine or abandon all or portions of these strategies, initiatives or actions, although we cannot guarantee that any such changes will be successful. The failure of any one or more of our present strategies, initiatives or actions, or the failure of any adjustments or alternative strategies, initiatives or actions that we may pursue or implement, to be successful would likely have an adverse effect on our ability to grow and increase the value and profitability of our business, to meet our debt service and other obligations necessary to operate our business in the ordinary course, and on our consolidated financial statements, as well as on our overall liquidity, and the effect in each case could be material.\nThe success of our present strategies, growth initiatives and our long-term performance depends on the availability of finished and partially finished lots and undeveloped land that meet our investment return and marketing standards.\nThe availability of finished and partially finished lots and undeveloped land that meet our investment return and marketing standards depends on a number of factors outside of our control, including, among other things, land availability in general, geographical/topographical constraints, land sellers\u2019 business relationships, competition for desirable property, legal or government agency or utility service company processes, our ability and the costs to obtain building permits and other regulatory requirements and prevailing conditions in the marketplace for land parcels. Should suitable lots or land become less available, the number of homes that we may be able to build and sell could be reduced, and the cost of attractive land could continue to increase, which could adversely impact our housing gross profit margins, our consolidated financial statements and our ability to maintain ownership or control of a sufficient supply of land inventory. The availability of suitable land could also affect the success of our current strategies and growth initiatives, and if we decide to reduce our land acquisition activity in 2015 below our current plans due to\na lack of available assets that meet our standards, our ability to increase our community count, to maintain or grow our revenues and housing gross profit, and to maintain or increase our profitability in 2015 and beyond, would likely be constrained and could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.\nThe value of the land and housing inventory we own or control may fall significantly.\nThe value of the inventory we currently own or control depends on market conditions, including estimates of future demand for, and the revenues that can be generated from, this inventory. The value of our inventory can vary considerably because there is often a significant amount of time between our acquiring control or taking ownership of land and the delivery of homes on that land, particularly undeveloped and/or unentitled land. Based on our periodic assessments of inventory for recoverability, we have from time to time written down certain of our inventory to its estimated fair value. We have also recorded charges in connection with activating or selling certain land held for future development and with abandoning our interests in certain land controlled under land option contracts and other similar contracts that no longer met our investment return or marketing standards. In 2014, we recorded $37.6 million of inventory impairment charges and $1.8 million of land option contract abandonment charges. If, in 2015, the present housing environment weakens, if particular markets or submarkets experience challenging or unfavorable changes in prevailing conditions, or if we elect to revise our strategy relating to certain land positions, we may need to take additional charges against our earnings for inventory impairments or land option contract abandonments, or both, or in connection with land sales to reflect changes in fair value of land or land interests in our inventory, including assets we have previously written down. Any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements, including our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.\nOur business is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions.\nOur operations and consolidated financial statements can be substantially affected by adverse changes in general economic or business conditions that are outside of our control, including changes in, among other factors:\n\u2022\nshort- and long-term interest rates;\n\u2022\nemployment levels and job and personal income growth;\n\u2022\nconsumer debt levels;\n\u2022\nhousing demand from population growth, household formation and other demographic changes;\n\u2022\navailability and pricing of mortgage financing for homebuyers;\n\u2022\nconsumer confidence generally and the confidence of potential homebuyers in particular;\n\u2022\nU.S. and global financial system and credit market stability;\n\u2022\nmortgage loan programs (including changes in FHA, Fannie Mae- and Freddie Mac-conforming mortgage loan limits, credit risk/mortgage loan insurance premiums and/or other costs or fees, down payment requirements and underwriting standards), and federal and state regulation, oversight, guidance and legal action regarding lending, home value appraisal, foreclosure and short sale practices;\n\u2022\nfederal and state personal income tax rates and provisions, including provisions for the deduction of mortgage loan interest payments, real estate taxes and other expenses;\n\u2022\nsupply of and prices for available new or resale homes (including lender-owned homes) and other housing alternatives, such as apartments, single-family rentals and other rental housing;\n\u2022\nhomebuyer interest in our current or new product designs and new home community locations, and general consumer interest in purchasing a home compared to choosing other housing alternatives; and\n\u2022\nreal estate taxes.\nAdverse changes in these conditions may affect our business nationally or may be more prevalent or concentrated in particular served markets.\nInclement weather, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and fires), and other environmental conditions can delay the delivery of our homes and/or increase our costs. Civil unrest or acts of terrorism can also have a negative effect on our business.\nThe potential difficulties described above can cause demand and selling prices for our homes to fall or cause us to take longer and incur more costs to develop land and build our homes. We may not be able to recover these increased costs because of market conditions. The potential difficulties could also lead some buyers to cancel or refuse to honor their home purchase contracts altogether. Reflecting difficult conditions in certain of our served markets, we have experienced volatility in our net orders in recent years, and we may experience similar or increased volatility in 2015 and beyond. If we do, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.\nHome selling prices and sales activity in the particular markets and regions in which we do business materially affect our consolidated financial statements because our business is concentrated in these markets.\nHome sales activity and selling prices in some of our key served markets have varied from time to time for market-specific and other reasons, including adverse weather, high levels of foreclosures, short sales and sales of lender-owned homes, and lack of affordability or economic contraction due to, among other things, the departure or decline of key industries and employers that could effectively price potential homebuyers out of purchasing homes, including our homes. If home sales activity or selling prices decline in one or more of our key served markets, including California, Florida, Nevada or Texas, our costs may not decline at all or at the same rate and, as a result, our consolidated financial statements may be materially and adversely affected. Adverse conditions in California would have a particularly material effect on our consolidated financial statements as our average selling price in the state is higher than the average selling prices in states within our other homebuilding reporting segments; a large percentage of our housing revenues is generated from California; and a significant proportion of our investments in land and land development since late 2009 have been made, and in 2015 are expected to be made, in that state.\nIn recent years, many state, regional and local governments in our served markets, including California, Florida and Nevada, have struggled to balance their budgets due to a number of factors. As a result, there have been significant cuts to government departments, subsidies, programs and public employee staffing levels, and taxes and fees have been raised. Lawmakers\u2019 efforts at all governmental levels to address these budget deficit issues and/or efforts to increase governmental revenues, could, among other things, cause businesses and residents to leave, or discourage businesses or households from coming to, affected served markets, which could, among other things, limit economic growth and cause significant delays in obtaining required inspections, permits or approvals with respect to residential development at our new home communities located in such markets, or result in higher costs for such permits or approvals. These negative impacts could adversely affect our ability to generate orders and revenues and/or to maintain or increase our housing gross profit margins in such markets, and the impact could be material and adverse to our consolidated financial statements.\nSupply shortages and other risks related to demand for building materials and/or subcontracted trade labor could increase costs and delay deliveries.\nAs discussed above under \u201cItem 1. Business - Competition, Seasonality, Delivery Mix and Other Factors,\u201d there is a high level of competition in the homebuilding industry and the housing market for subcontracted trade labor and building materials that can, among other things, cause increases in land development and home construction costs, and development and construction delays. Shortages or upward price fluctuations in lumber, drywall, concrete and other building materials, and subcontracted trade labor, whether due to a small supplier base or supplier capacity constraints, increased residential construction activity, international demand, the occurrence of or rebuilding after natural disasters or other reasons, can also have an adverse effect on our business. We may not be able to raise our selling prices to cover such increases in land development and home construction costs because of market conditions, including competition for homebuyers from other homebuilders and resale homes. Sustained increases in land development and home construction costs due to higher subcontracted trade labor rates or elevated lumber, drywall, concrete and other building materials prices and/or our limited ability to successfully contain these costs may, among other things, decrease our housing gross profit margins, while shortages of subcontracted trade labor or building materials due to competition or other factors may delay deliveries of homes and our recognition of revenues. As a result, these negative items, individually or together, could have a material and adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nInflation may adversely affect us by increasing costs that we may not be able to recover, particularly if home selling prices decrease, and the impact on our performance and our consolidated financial statements could be material.\nInflation can have an adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial statements because increasing costs for land, subcontracted trade labor or building materials could require us to increase our home selling prices in an effort to maintain satisfactory housing gross profit margins. However, we may not be able to increase our home selling prices to cover inflation in direct construction and/or other costs due to market conditions, and may need to hold or reduce our selling prices in order to compete for home sales. If determined necessary, our lowering of home selling prices and/or using sales incentives, in addition to impacting our housing gross profit margins, may also reduce the value of our land inventory, including the assets we have purchased in recent years, and make it more difficult for us to fully recover the costs of our land and any related land development\nthrough our home selling prices or, if we choose, through land sales. In addition, depressed land values may cause us to abandon and forfeit deposits on land option contracts and other similar contracts if we cannot satisfactorily renegotiate the purchase price of the subject land. We may incur charges against our earnings for inventory impairments if the value of our owned inventory, including land we decide to sell, is reduced or for land option contract abandonments if we choose not to exercise land option contracts or other similar contracts, and these charges may be substantial. Inflation may also increase interest rates for mortgage loans and thereby reduce demand for our homes and lead to lower revenues, as well as increase the interest rates we may need to accept to obtain external financing.\nReduced home sales may impair our ability to recoup development costs or force us to absorb additional costs.\nWe incur many costs before we begin to build homes in a community. Depending on the stage of development a land parcel is in when acquired, such costs may include expenditures for developing land, finishing and entitling lots and installing roads, sewers, water systems and other utilities; taxes and other items related to ownership of the land on which we plan to build homes; constructing model homes; and promotional marketing and overhead expenses to prepare for the opening of a new home community for sales. Moreover, local municipalities may impose development-related requirements resulting in additional costs. If the rate at which we sell and deliver homes slows or falls, or if our opening of new home communities for sales is delayed due to adjustments in our marketing strategy, protracted governmental approval processes or utility service activations or other reasons, we may incur additional costs, which would adversely affect our housing gross profit margins, and it will take a longer period of time for us to recover our costs, including those we incurred in acquiring and developing land in recent years. We may also decide to abandon certain land option contracts and other similar contracts, and sell certain land at a loss, and the costs of doing so may be adverse and material to our consolidated financial statements.\nSome homebuyers may cancel their home purchases because the required deposits are small and sometimes refundable.\nOur backlog at a given point in time reflects the number of homes under a home purchase contract that have not yet been delivered to a homebuyer. Our home purchase contracts typically require only a small deposit, some or all of which is refundable prior to closing. If the prices for new homes decline, competitors increase their use of sales incentives, lenders and others increase their efforts to sell resale homes, subcontracted trade labor or building materials shortages or protracted governmental approval processes or utility service activations delay our home construction cycle times, mortgage loan interest rates increase, the availability of mortgage financing further diminishes or there is continued weakness or a downturn in local or regional economies or the national economy and/or in consumer confidence, customers may cancel their existing home purchase contracts with us because they have been unable to finalize their mortgage financing for the purchase, they desire to move into a home earlier than we can deliver it, or in order to attempt to negotiate for a lower price or explore other options or for other reasons they are unable or unwilling to complete the purchase. Volatile cancellation rates resulting from these conditions, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial statements.\nTax law changes could make home ownership more expensive or less attractive.\nUnder current tax law and policy, significant expenses of owning a home, including mortgage loan interest costs and real estate taxes, generally are deductible expenses for the purpose of calculating an individual\u2019s or household\u2019s federal, and in some cases state, taxable income subject to various limitations. If the federal government or a state government changes its income tax laws by eliminating, limiting or substantially reducing these income tax benefits, the after-tax cost of owning a home could increase substantially. Any additional increases in personal income tax rates and/or additional tax deduction limits or restrictions enacted at the federal or state levels could adversely impact demand for and/or selling prices of new homes, including our homes, and the effect on our consolidated financial statements could be adverse and material.\nWe are subject to substantial legal and regulatory requirements regarding the development of land, the homebuilding process and protection of the environment, which can cause us to suffer delays and incur costs associated with compliance and which can prohibit or restrict homebuilding activity in some regions or areas. The impact of such requirements, individually or collectively, could be adverse and material to the implementation of our strategic growth initiatives and our consolidated financial statements.\nOur homebuilding business is heavily regulated and subject to a significant amount of local, state and federal regulation concerning zoning, allowable housing density, natural and other resource protection, building designs, land development and home construction methods, worksite safety and similar matters, as well as governmental taxes, fees and levies on the acquisition and development of land parcels. These regulations often provide broad discretion to government authorities that oversee these matters, which can result in unanticipated delays, adjustments in the allowable scope, size or characteristics, and/or increases in the cost of a specified development project or a number of projects in particular markets. We may also experience delays due to a building\npermit moratorium or regulatory restrictions in any of the locations in which we operate, which can affect the balance of land held for future development in our inventory.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment, including requirements to manage and/or mitigate storm water runoff, dust particles and other environmental impacts of our land development and home construction activities at our new home communities. These laws and regulations, and/or evolving interpretations thereof, may cause delays in our land development and in our construction and delivery of homes, may cause us to incur substantial compliance, litigation and other costs, and can prohibit or restrict homebuilding activity in certain regions or areas, any of which could also reduce the fair value of affected inventory and require us to record significant impairment charges. Environmental laws may also impose liability for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances whether or not the developer or owner of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of those substances. The presence of those substances on our properties may prevent us from selling our homes and we may also be liable, under applicable laws and regulations or lawsuits brought by private parties, for hazardous or toxic substances on land that we have sold in the past. Further, a significant portion of our business is conducted in California, one of the most highly regulated and litigious states in the country. Therefore, our potential exposure to losses and expenses due to new laws, regulations or litigation may be greater than other homebuilders with a less significant California presence. However, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, significant litigation losses and expenses in our other homebuilding reporting segments, and any such future losses and expenses could be material to our business and consolidated financial statements.\nThe homebuilding industry and housing market are very competitive, and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or our consolidated financial statements.\nWe face significant competition in several areas of our business from other homebuilders and participants in the overall housing industry. These competitive conditions can result in:\n\u2022\nour delivering fewer homes;\n\u2022\nour selling homes at lower prices;\n\u2022\nour offering or increasing sales incentives, discounts or price concessions for our homes;\n\u2022\nour experiencing lower housing gross profit margins, particularly if we cannot raise our selling prices to cover increased land acquisition and development, direct construction or overhead costs or inflation;\n\u2022\nour selling fewer homes or experiencing a higher number of cancellations by homebuyers;\n\u2022\nimpairments in the value of our inventory and other assets;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in acquiring desirable land that meets our investment return or marketing standards, and in selling our interests in land that no longer meet such standards on favorable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in our acquiring raw materials and skilled management and subcontracted trade labor at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\ndelays in the development of land and/or the construction of our homes; and/or\n\u2022\ndifficulty in securing external financing, performance bonds or letter of credit facilities on favorable terms.\nThese competitive conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements by decreasing our revenues, impairing our ability to successfully implement our current strategies, initiatives or actions, increasing our costs and/or diminishing growth in our local or regional homebuilding businesses. During the housing downturn in particular, actions taken by our new home and housing alternative competitors reduced the effectiveness of our efforts to achieve stability or increases in home selling prices, to generate higher deliveries of homes, revenues and housing gross profit margins, and to maintain or increase our profitability. We cannot provide any assurances that such conditions and their negative impacts will not occur in 2015 or beyond.\nHomebuilding is subject to warranty and liability claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant.\nIn the ordinary course of our homebuilding business, we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims. We record warranty and other liabilities for the homes we deliver based primarily on historical experience in our served markets and our judgment of the risks associated with the types of homes we build. As described in Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report, we maintain, and require the majority of our subcontractors to maintain, general liability insurance (including construction defect and bodily injury coverage) and workers\u2019 compensation\ninsurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims related to our homebuilding activities, subject to certain self-insured retentions, deductibles and other coverage limits. We self-insure a portion of our overall risk through the use of a captive insurance subsidiary. We also maintain certain other insurance policies. Because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters, we cannot provide any assurance that our various insurance arrangements and our liabilities will be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future, or that any potential inadequacies will not have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently limited and costly, and, in our case, have relatively high self-insured retentions that limit coverage significantly. There can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted, increasing our risks and financial exposure to claims, and/or become more costly and to a material degree.\nWe, or our engaged general contractors, engage subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes, and in many cases, to obtain the necessary building materials. Our contracts with our subcontractors require that they comply with all laws applicable to their work, including labor laws, meet performance standards, and follow local building codes and permits. However, we may encounter improper construction practices or the installation of defective materials in our homes, among other things. When we discover these issues, we will evaluate and, if necessary, repair the homes in accordance with our new home limited warranty and as required by law. Although we will pursue recoveries from potentially responsible parties, we may be unable to recover the costs of warranty-related repairs from subcontractors, suppliers or insurers, which could have a material and adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, warranty and construction defect issues can result in negative publicity in various media that could be detrimental to our reputation and adversely affect our efforts to sell homes. We can provide no assurance that in 2015 we will not face more warranty-related claims and/or incur higher costs to satisfy repair or other obligations related to our new home limited warranty and customer service activities, or not need to record charges to adjust our overall warranty liability, or experience negative publicity or be successful in obtaining any recoveries for warranty-related costs we incur from responsible parties, and that any of these items - if they occur, or with respect to recoveries of warranty-related costs, fail to occur - could, individually or collectively, have a material and adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of the seasonal nature of our business, our quarterly operating results fluctuate.\nAs discussed above under \u201cItem 1. Business - Competition, Seasonality, Delivery Mix and Other Factors,\u201d we experience seasonal fluctuations in our quarterly operating results that can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Historically, a significant percentage of our home purchase contracts are entered into in the spring and early summer months, and we deliver a corresponding significant percentage of our homes in the late summer and fall months. As a result, we have experienced uneven quarterly results, with generally fewer homes delivered and lower revenues during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year. Though we expect to experience the traditional seasonality impacts on our results as the present housing recovery progresses, we can make no assurances as to the degree to which such historical seasonal patterns will occur in 2015 and beyond, if at all.\nWe may be restricted in accessing external capital, and to the extent we can access external capital, it may increase our costs of capital or result in stockholder dilution.\nWe have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services activities with internally generated cash flows and external sources of debt and equity financing. During the recent housing market downturn, our reduced stockholders\u2019 equity and high ratio of debt to capital, in addition to volatility in the financial and credit markets, made external sources of liquidity less available and more costly to us. In the fourth quarter of 2014, largely as a result of the reversal of a substantial portion of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance, our stockholders\u2019 equity and ratio of debt to capital have improved. However, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to generate cash flow from our operations or access external credit or equity markets in 2015 or beyond at favorable terms or at all, or that our stockholders\u2019 equity and ratio of debt to capital will remain at, or further improve from, their respective 2014 year-end levels.\nMarket conditions in 2015 and beyond may significantly limit our ability to replace or refinance indebtedness, in part due to the ratings of our senior notes by the three principal nationally recognized registered credit rating agencies, as discussed further below. The terms of potential future issuances of indebtedness by us may be more restrictive than the terms governing our current indebtedness, and the issuance, interest and debt service expenses could be higher. A higher interest rate on or more restrictive terms governing our debt could materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated financial statements. In addition, the relatively low market value of our common stock and volatility in the securities markets could impede our access to the equity markets or increase the amount of dilution our stockholders would experience should we seek to raise capital through the issuance of new equity or convertible securities.\nWhile we believe we can meet our forecasted capital requirements from our cash resources, expected future cash flow, capital markets access and the external financing sources that we anticipate will be available to us, we can provide no assurance that we\nwill be able to do so, or do so without incurring substantially higher costs or significantly diluting existing stockholders\u2019 equity interests. The adverse effects of these conditions on our business, liquidity and consolidated financial statements could be material to us.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness in relation to our tangible net worth and unrestricted cash balance, which may restrict our ability to meet our operational and strategic goals.\nAs of November 30, 2014, we had total outstanding debt of $2.58 billion, total stockholders\u2019 equity of $1.60 billion, and an unrestricted cash balance of $356.4 million. The amount of our debt overall and relative to our total stockholders\u2019 equity and unrestricted cash balance could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, inventory-related investments, debt service requirements or other business needs, including, but not limited to, supporting our strategic growth initiatives and operational actions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Facility or to renew or, if necessary or desirable, expand the capacity of the Credit Facility;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to renew or, if necessary or desirable, expand the capacity of any letter of credit facilities (including the LOC Facilities), and to obtain performance bonds in the ordinary course of our business;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to pay dividends on shares of our common stock;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the collateralization or payment of our debt and reduce our ability to use our cash flow for other purposes, including investments in our business;\n\u2022\nimpact our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to implement our present strategies, particularly our land acquisition and development plans and asset activation initiatives, in part due to competition from other homebuilders, developers and investors with greater available liquidity or balance sheet strength;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage because we have more debt or debt-related restrictions than some of our competitors; and\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable in the event of weakness or a downturn in our business or in general economic or housing market conditions.\nOur ability to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend on our future performance. As of the date of this report, our next scheduled maturity of senior notes is on June 15, 2015 with respect to $199.9 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6 1/4% senior notes due 2015 (the \u201c6 1/4% Senior Notes due 2015\u201d).\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and external financing at a reasonable cost may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to meet our debt service obligations, fulfill the financial or operational obligations we may have under certain unconsolidated joint venture transactions, support our letter of credit facilities (including the LOC Facilities), or fund our other liquidity or operational needs. Further, as described in Note 13. Notes Payable in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report, if a change of control were to occur as defined in the instrument governing our senior notes, or if a fundamental change under the terms of our 1.375% convertible senior notes due 2019 (the \u201c1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019\u201d), which includes a change of control, occurs prior to their stated maturity date, we may be required to offer to purchase certain of our senior notes or all of the convertible senior notes, plus accrued interest and unpaid interest, if any. In such circumstances, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may, given our unrestricted cash balance, need to refinance and/or restructure with our lenders or other creditors all or a portion of our outstanding debt obligations on or before their maturity, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms or at all, or raise capital through equity or convertible security issuances that would dilute existing stockholders\u2019 interests, and the impact of such circumstances on our liquidity and consolidated financial statements would be material and adverse.\nFailure to comply with the restrictions and covenants imposed by the Credit Facility and the agreements governing our indebtedness could restrict future borrowing or cause any outstanding indebtedness to become immediately due and payable.\nUnder the terms of the Credit Facility, we are required, among other things, to maintain compliance with various covenants, including financial covenants relating to our tangible net worth, leverage, and interest coverage or liquidity. The Credit Facility is also governed by a borrowing base test and includes a limitation on investments in joint ventures and non-guarantor subsidiaries.\nAmong other things, these restrictions and covenants can influence our operating decisions of whether to enter into, or the manner in which we can structure certain transactions in order to maintain compliance. If we fail to comply with these restrictions and covenants, the participating financial institutions could terminate the Credit Facility, cause borrowings under the Credit Facility, if any, to become immediately due and payable and/or could demand that we compensate them for waiving instances of noncompliance. In addition, a default under the Credit Facility under certain circumstances or a default under any series of our senior notes or convertible senior notes could cause a default with respect to our other senior or convertible senior notes and result in the acceleration of the maturity of all of our senior or convertible senior notes and our inability to borrow under the Credit Facility, as well as incurring penalties and additional fees, all of which would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and on our consolidated financial statements. Moreover, we may need to curtail our investment activities and other uses of cash to maintain compliance with the restrictions and covenants under the Credit Facility.\nThe indenture governing our outstanding senior notes and convertible senior notes imposes restrictions on our business operations and activities. Though it does not contain any financial maintenance covenants, the indenture contains certain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur secured indebtedness, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions involving property or assets above a specified value, and, in the case of five series of our outstanding senior notes and our convertible senior notes, to engage in mergers, consolidations, and sales of assets. Due to financial and credit market conditions, we may also need to include additional covenants, obligations or restrictions in our indenture or with respect to a specific issuance of securities or to our currently outstanding securities. If we fail to comply with any of these covenants, obligations or restrictions, the holders of our senior notes or convertible senior notes could cause such debt to become due and payable prior to maturity or could demand that we compensate them for waiving instances of noncompliance, and, if they are successful in doing so, the impact on our liquidity and consolidated financial statements would be material and adverse. In addition, a default under any series of our senior notes or convertible senior notes could cause a default with respect to our other senior notes and result in the acceleration of the maturity of all such defaulted indebtedness and other debt obligations, as well as penalties and additional fees, which would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and consolidated financial statements.\nOur ability to obtain external financing could be adversely affected by a negative change in our credit rating by a third-party rating agency.\nOur ability to access the capital markets and external financing sources on favorable terms is a key factor in our ability to fund our operations and to grow our business. As of the date of this report, our credit rating by Fitch Ratings is B+, with a stable outlook, our credit rating by Moody\u2019s Investor Services is B2, with a positive outlook, and our credit rating by Standard and Poor\u2019s Financial Services is B, with a stable outlook. Downgrades of our credit rating by any of these principal nationally recognized registered credit rating agencies may make it more difficult and costly for us to access the capital markets and external financing sources, and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and consolidated financial statements.\nWe may have difficulty in continuing to obtain the additional financing required to operate and develop our business.\nOur homebuilding operations and our present strategies require significant amounts of cash and/or the availability of external financing. We have entered into the Credit Facility and the LOC Facilities, and issued common stock, senior notes and our convertible senior notes, in order to support certain aspects of our operations in the ordinary course of our business, including our acquisition of land, land development and other of our strategic growth initiatives. We anticipate that we will need to maintain the Credit Facility and the LOC Facilities in 2015, and, if necessary or desirable, we may seek to expand their capacities or enter into additional such facilities, or other similar facility arrangements with the same or other financial institutions. We may also issue additional senior notes and/or convertible senior notes or equity. It is not possible to predict the future terms or availability of additional external capital or for maintaining or, if necessary or desirable, expanding the capacity of the Credit Facility or the LOC Facilities or entering into additional such facilities. Moreover, our outstanding senior notes and convertible senior notes contain provisions that may restrict the amount and nature of debt we may incur in the future. As financial and credit markets have been experiencing and may continue to experience volatility, there can be no assurance that we can borrow additional funds, raise additional capital through other means, or successfully maintain or, if necessary or desirable, expand the capacity of the Credit Facility or the LOC Facilities or enter into additional such facilities in each case at reasonable cost or at all, each of which depends, among other factors, on conditions in the capital markets and our perceived credit worthiness, as discussed above. If conditions in the financial and credit markets continue to be volatile or worsen, whether generally, or for homebuilders or us in particular, it could reduce our ability to implement our strategies, initiatives and actions and profitably grow our business and materially and adversely impact our consolidated financial statements. Current and future federal and state regulations limiting the investment activities of financial institutions, including regulations that have been or may be issued under the Dodd-Frank Act, could also impact our ability to access the capital markets, to obtain additional external financing and/or maintain or, if necessary or desirable, expand the Credit Facility or the LOC Facilities or enter into additional such facilities, in each case on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may not realize our deferred income tax assets. In addition, our net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.\nAt November 30, 2014, we had deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $866.4 million, against which we had a valuation allowance of $41.2 million. While we have provided a valuation allowance against certain of our net deferred tax assets, the valuation allowance is subject to change as facts and circumstances change. The accounting for deferred income taxes is based upon estimates of our future results. A housing downturn or other adverse circumstances that negatively affect our future taxable income could require us to record a larger valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Differences between estimated and actual results could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, and the impact may be adverse. Our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets is based on the extent to which we generate sustained profits, and we cannot provide any assurances as to when and to what extent we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our net deferred tax assets, whether in whole or in part.\nChanges in tax laws could also affect our actual tax results, the valuation of our net deferred tax assets and our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets. Specifically, a decrease in enacted corporate income tax rates in our major jurisdictions, especially in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, would decrease the value of our deferred tax assets and result in a corresponding charge to income tax expense, which could be material, as well as reduce our utilization of our deferred tax assets.\nIn addition, notwithstanding the reversal of a substantial portion of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance at November 30, 2014, the benefits of our deferred tax assets, including our net operating losses (\u201cNOL\u201d), built-in losses and tax credits, would be reduced or potentially eliminated if we experienced an \u201cownership change,\u201d under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (\u201cSection 382\u201d). A Section 382 ownership change occurs if a stockholder or a group of stockholders who are deemed to own at least 5% of our common stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. If an ownership change were to occur, Section 382 would impose an annual limit on the amount of NOL we could use to reduce our taxable income equal to the product of the total value of our outstanding equity immediately prior to the ownership change (reduced by certain items specified in Section 382) and the federal long-term tax-exempt interest rate in effect for the month of the ownership change. A number of complex rules apply in calculating this annual limit.\nWhile the complexity of Section 382\u2019s provisions and the limited knowledge any public company has about the ownership of its publicly traded stock make it difficult to determine whether an ownership change has occurred, we currently believe that an ownership change has not occurred. However, and notwithstanding the reversal of a substantial portion of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of 2014, if an ownership change were to occur, the annual limit Section 382 may impose could result in a material amount of our NOL expiring unused. This would significantly impair the value of our NOL and, as a result, have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2009, our stockholders approved an amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation that is designed to block transfers of our common stock that could result in an ownership change, and a rights agreement pursuant to which we have issued certain stock purchase rights with terms designed to deter transfers of our common stock that could result in an ownership change. However, these measures cannot guarantee complete protection against an ownership change and it remains possible that one may occur.\nOur cash flows, liquidity and consolidated financial statements could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain performance bonds and/or letters of credit.\nIn the course of developing our new home communities, we are often required to provide to various municipalities and other government agencies performance bonds and/or letters of credit to secure the completion of our projects and/or in support of obligations to build community improvements such as roads, sewers, water systems and other utilities, and to support similar development activities by certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures. We may also be required to provide performance bonds and/or letters of credit to secure our performance under various escrow agreements, financial guarantees and other arrangements. Our ability to obtain such bonds or letters of credit and the cost to do so depend on our credit rating, overall market capitalization, available capital, past operational and financial performance, management expertise and other factors, including prevailing surety market conditions, and the underwriting practices and resources of performance bond and/or letter of credit issuers. If we are unable to obtain performance bonds and/or letters of credit when required or the cost or operational restrictions or conditions imposed by issuers to obtain them increases significantly in 2015 or beyond, we may not be able to develop or we may be significantly delayed in developing a new home community or communities, be required to post cash collateral, decreasing our unrestricted cash balance, and/or we may incur significant additional expenses, and, as a result, our business and consolidated financial statements, cash flows and/or liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur ability to attract and retain talent is critical to the success of our business and a failure to do so may materially and adversely affect our performance.\nOur officers and employees are an important resource, and we see attracting and retaining a dedicated and talented team to execute our KBnxt operational business model as crucial to our ability to achieve and maintain an advantage over other homebuilders. We face intense competition for qualified personnel, particularly at senior management levels, from other homebuilders, from other companies in the housing and real estate industries, and from companies in various other industries with respect to certain roles or functions. Moreover, the decline in the market value of our common stock has made it difficult for us to attract and retain talent. If we are unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees, or if we need to significantly increase compensation and benefits to do so (including as a result of complying with pending health care coverage requirements of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act of 2010), or, alternatively, if we are required or believe it is appropriate to reduce our overhead expenses through significant personnel reductions or adjustments to compensation and benefits, our performance, our ability to achieve and maintain a competitive advantage and our consolidated financial statements could be materially and adversely affected.\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.\nWe use information technology, digital telecommunications and other computer resources to carry out important operational and promotional marketing activities and to maintain our business records. Many of these resources are provided to us and/or maintained on our behalf by third-party service providers pursuant to agreements that specify to varying degrees certain security and service level standards. Although we and our service providers employ what we believe are adequate security, disaster recovery and other preventative and corrective measures, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired if these resources, including our primary website, are compromised, degraded, damaged or fail, whether due to a virus or other harmful circumstance, intentional penetration or disruption of our information technology resources by a third party, natural disaster, hardware or software corruption or failure or error or poor product or vendor/developer selection (including a failure of security controls incorporated into or applied to such hardware or software), telecommunications system failure, service provider error or failure, intentional or unintentional personnel actions (including the failure to follow our security protocols), or lost connectivity to our networked resources. A significant and extended disruption in the functioning of these resources, including our primary website, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, orders, deliveries of homes and revenues, result in the unintended and/or unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary, personal identifying and confidential information (including information about our buyers and business partners), and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues, expenses that we may not be able to recover in whole or in any part from our service providers or responsible parties, or their or our insurers. The release of confidential information may also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals and/or business partners and/or by regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines and cause reputational harm, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements. In addition, the costs of maintaining adequate protection against such threats, based on considerations of their evolution, pervasiveness and frequency and/or government-mandated standards or obligations regarding protective efforts, could be material to our consolidated financial statements in a particular period or over various periods.", "PERMNO": 70092, "SIC": 1531, "TIC": "KBH"}
