{"cik": "1514732", "company": "SAExploration Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity could be adversely affected by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity could result in a decline in the value of our common stock and other securities.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nOur business largely depends on the levels of exploration and development activity in the oil and natural gas industry, a historically cyclical industry. A decrease in this activity caused by low oil and natural gas prices, increased supply, and reduced demand, such as has occurred over the last several years, has had an adverse effect on our business, liquidity and results of operations.\nDemand for our services depends upon the level of spending by oil and natural gas companies for exploration, production, development and field management activities, which depend, in part, on oil and natural gas supplies and prices. The markets for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and are likely to continue to be so in the future. In addition to the market prices of oil and natural gas, our customers\u2019 willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which our management has no control. A decline in oil and natural gas\nexploration activities and commodity prices, as has occurred over the last several years, has adversely affected the demand for our services and our results of operations.\nFactors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas and our customers\u2019 desire to explore, develop and produce include:\n\u2022\nthe level of supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nexpectations about future prices for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe worldwide political, military and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to set and maintain production levels and prices for oil;\n\u2022\nthe rate of discovery of new oil and natural gas reserves and the decline of existing oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe ability of exploration and production companies to generate funds or otherwise obtain capital for exploration, development and production operations;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy exploration, production and consumption;\n\u2022\ngovernment policies, including environmental regulations and tax policies, regarding the exploration for, production and development of oil and natural gas reserves, the use of fossil fuels and alternative energy sources and climate change;\n\u2022\nweather conditions, including large-scale weather events such as hurricanes that affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area or affect prices; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the Alaskan oil and gas tax credit system which may significantly affect the level of exploration spending within Alaska and has negatively affected our current liquidity position.\nOver the last several years, oil prices have declined significantly due in large part to increasing supplies, weakening demand growth, some oil and gas producing countries' position to not cut production and the lifting of sanctions against Iran. The weakening economic outlook for non-U.S. oil demand, especially in China and Europe, has put more downward pressure on prices. Thus, the price for crude oil has decreased significantly beginning in the third quarter of 2014.\nAs a result of these decreases in crude oil prices, many E&P companies have reduced their capital expenditures, which has resulted in diminished demand for our services and products and downward pressure on the prices we charge or the level of work we do for our customers.\nWe cannot assure you that the exploration and development activities by our customers will be maintained at current levels. Any significant decline in exploration or production-related spending by our customers, whether due to a decrease in the market prices for oil and natural gas or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, increases in oil and natural gas prices may not increase demand for our products and services or otherwise have a positive effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur revenues are subject to fluctuations that are beyond our control, which may be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations in any financial period.\nOur operating results may vary in material respects from quarter to quarter. Factors that cause variations include the timing of the receipt and commencement of contracts for seismic data acquisition, processing or interpretation and customers\u2019 budgetary cycles, all of which are beyond our control. In addition, in any given period, we could have idle crews which result in a significant portion of our revenues, cash flows and earnings coming from a relatively small number of crews. Lower crew utilization rates can be caused by land access permit and weather delays, seasonal factors such as holiday schedules, shorter winter days or agricultural or hunting seasons, and crew repositioning and crew utilization and productivity. Additionally, due to location, type of service or particular project, some of our individual crews may achieve results that constitute a significant percentage of our consolidated operating results. Should any of our crews experience changes in timing or delays due to one or more of these factors, our financial results could be subject to significant variations from period to period. Combined with our fixed costs, these revenue fluctuations could also produce unexpected adverse results of operations in any fiscal period.\nIn addition to the above potential fluctuations in our revenue, we may also have significant third-party pass-through costs that are reflected in our revenues but correspond to a very small administrative margin charged to the customer. Therefore, our revenues for certain periods may include a large amount of these third-party charges and can cause our gross profit margin to be lower.\nRevenues derived from our projects may not be sufficient to cover our costs of completing those projects or may not result in the profit we anticipated when we entered into the contract.\nOur revenue is determined, in part, by the prices we receive for our services, the productivity of our crews and the accuracy of our cost estimates. The productivity of our crews is partly a function of external factors, such as weather and third party delays, over which we have no control. In addition, cost estimates for our projects may be inadequate due to unknown factors associated with the work to be performed and market conditions, resulting in cost over-runs. If our crews encounter operational difficulties or delays, or if we have not correctly priced our services, our results of operation may vary and, in some cases, may be adversely affected.\nOur projects are performed on both a turnkey basis where a defined amount and scope of work is provided by us for a fixed price and additional work, which is subject to customer approval, is billed separately, and is performed on a term basis where work is provided by us for a fixed hourly, daily or monthly fee. The relative mix of turnkey and term agreements, as related to our projects, can vary widely from time to time. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized on a turnkey contract can vary from our estimated amount because of changes in job conditions, variations in labor and equipment productivity from the original estimates, and the performance of subcontractors. In addition, if conditions exist on a particular project that were not anticipated in the customer contract such as excessive weather delays, community issues, governmental issues or equipment failure, then the revenue timing and amount from a project can be affected substantially. Turnkey contracts may also cause us to bear substantially all of the risks of business interruption caused by weather delays and other hazards. Those variations, delays and risks inherent in billing customers at a fixed price may result in us experiencing reduced profitability or losses on projects.\nThe significant fixed costs of our operations could result in operating losses.\nWe are subject to significant fixed operating costs, which primarily consist of depreciation and maintenance expenses associated with our equipment, certain crew costs and interest expense on our outstanding indebtedness. Extended periods of significant downtime or low productivity caused by reduced demand, weather interruptions, equipment failures, permit delays or other causes could negatively affect our results and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations because we will not be able to reduce our fixed costs as fast as revenues decline.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by asset impairments.\nWe periodically review our portfolio of equipment for impairment. A prolonged downturn could affect the carrying value of our equipment or other assets and require us to recognize a loss. We may be required to write down the value of our equipment if the present value of future cash flows anticipated to be generated from the related equipment falls below net book value. A decline in oil and natural gas prices, if sustained, can result in future impairments. Because the impairment of long-lived assets or goodwill would be recorded as an operating expense, such a write-down would negatively affect our net income and may result in a breach of certain of our financial covenants under the terms of the documents governing our indebtedness.\nOur working capital needs are difficult to forecast and may vary significantly, which could cause liquidity issues and require us to seek additional financing that we may not be able to obtain on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nOur working capital needs are difficult to predict with certainty. Our available cash varies in material respects as a result of, among other things, the timing of our projects, our customers\u2019 budgetary cycles and our receipt of payment. In particular, delays in receiving payments on our accounts receivable relating to our Alaskan tax credits discussed below may cause liquidity issues for us in the future. Our working capital requirements may continue to increase, due to contraction in our business or expansion of infrastructure that may be required to keep pace with technological advances. Over time, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities. In addition, some of our larger projects require significant upfront costs. We therefore may be subject to significant and rapid increases in our working capital needs that could require us to seek additional financing sources. While we currently have a senior loan facility and a revolving line of credit, and we have reduced our outstanding indebtedness as a result of the Restructuring, we have minimal remaining borrowing base and restrictions in our debt agreements as well as our current cash flow and liquidity difficulties may impair our ability to obtain other sources of financing, and access to additional sources of financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, as described in Note 6, our revolving line of credit has a maturity date of November 6, 2017 and, as described in Note 7, our senior term loan facility has a maturity date of January 2, 2018. While we are currently working on various financing alternatives that could replace or renew our revolving line of credit or senior loan facility, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nDevelopments in the State of Alaska and their consequences for the market for exploration tax credits and the impacts of those developments on our cash flow have intensified the negative impact on our current liquidity and cash flow.\nThe State of Alaska offers two types of exploration tax credits (\u201cTax Credits\u201d), which certain of our Alaskan customers receive in connection with the acquisition of seismic data that we generate. These customers may utilize cash received from the State of Alaska for the Tax Credits or, more typically, from the proceeds of a third party loan secured by the Tax Credits to pay accounts receivable due to us. As a result, we have, from time to time, accounts receivable due from Alaskan customers where the timing and amount of payment to us may be dependent upon when the Tax Credits can be monetized. In connection with the above, our Alaskan customers manage the Tax Credit process, which includes filing an application, undergoing an audit and receiving a Tax Credit certificate for the permitted amount. However, the ultimate disposition and timing of the process of the issuance of a Tax Credit certificate by the State of Alaska is outside our control. Historically, applicants have been able to quickly monetize Tax Credits before the issuance of the Tax Credit certificates and remit prompt payment to us by securing a loan from a financial institution secured by the Tax Credits. However, we believe, based on publicly available information, that the State of Alaska\u2019s existing budget deficit, delays in the State of Alaska paying on Tax Credits compared to historical timing, a veto by the governor of Alaska over the line item in the budget to pay Tax Credits in the fiscal 2017 budget and speculation regarding possible legislation that may amend the current Tax Credit program have produced substantial uncertainty about the timing of reimbursement from the State of Alaska for Tax Credits. As a consequence of this uncertainty, we believe that many, if not all, third-party financial institutions have suspended lending against Tax Credits prior to issuance of a Tax Credit certificate. In turn, our Alaskan customers\u2019 ability to monetize these Tax Credits in a timely manner has also been materially and adversely affected.\nIn particular, at December 31, 2016, we had an account receivable of approximately $81.6 million due to us from one customer, making this currently our largest account receivable and the single largest item affecting our short-term liquidity, other than the general decline in our business due to the downturn in the business of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. This customer relies upon Tax Credits to fund projects performed by us. Although this customer had previously notified us that it was working on several possible monetization solutions, it informed us that it was unsuccessful in monetizing its Tax Credits and that it was highly unlikely that it would be able to pay us the account receivable on a timely basis. As a result, in 2016 our customer assigned $72.9 million of Tax Credits related to completed programs to us so that we can seek to monetize these Tax Credits and apply the resulting cash, as monetization occurs, toward the customer\u2019s repayment of its overdue account receivable. In January 2017, the customer assigned the remaining $16.1 million of Tax Credits to us. Based on the expected timing to monetize the Tax Credits, we have reclassified certain of our receivables from current accounts receivable to long-term accounts receivable and may need to reclassify additional accounts receivable in the future.\nIn its review of approximately $30.2 million of Tax Credit applications during the audit process, we received approximately $24.4 million of Tax Credits from the State of Alaska during the year ended December 31, 2016. The State of Alaska disallowed approximately $5.8 million of what we believe should be eligible expenditures. Our customer filed an appeal of this decision on October 18, 2016 seeking a reversal of the disallowed amount. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a reduction of our accounts receivable balance of $10.9 million related to the monetization of Tax Credit certificates and recorded an additional reduction of $3.5 million in 2017 through March 10, 2017. We expect certificates representing approximately $58.8 million in Tax Credits to be issued on a rolling basis in 2017.\nThere continues to be uncertainty regarding the timely payment by the State of Alaska of its obligations on issued Tax Credit certificates as well as our ability to accurately estimate the timeframe for such payments. We continue to explore options to monetize the Tax Credit certificates, including an option to sell the certificates in the secondary market at a discount to purchasers that are able to apply the certificates to reduce their own Alaskan tax liabilities. There is a risk that any monetization of the Tax Credits certificates, however, will reflect a substantial discount and may be insufficient to fully repay the customer\u2019s outstanding account receivable. Should this occur, we may be required to record an impairment of the amount due from our customer.\nAs part of the Restructuring, we entered into a senior loan facility, which added up to $30.0 million in additional liquidity. The senior loan facility is secured by a junior first lien on our accounts receivable, which includes the Tax Credits and certificates evidencing the Tax Credits. Those Tax Credits and certificates are also pledged on a senior first lien basis to the lender under our revolving credit facility. All proceeds from monetizing the Tax Credits or Tax Credit certificates are paid into an account at the lender under the revolving credit facility and automatically reduce the amount we have borrowed under that line of credit. The senior loan facility requires that once we have received $15 million in proceeds from the Tax Credits or Tax Credit certificates, unless waived by the lenders (or individual lenders) under the senior loan facility, mandatory repayments of the amount received for the Tax Credits or Tax Credit certificates must be made. As a result, once we have received $15 million in proceeds from the Tax Credits or Tax Credit certificates, which we expect will occur shortly, until the outstanding balance on the senior loan facility is paid in full, the amount owed to the lender under the senior loan facility must come from cash or from a re-borrowing of the amount due under our revolving credit facility. If we are able to monetize our Tax Credits as we anticipate, however, we expect that we will be able to repay the senior loan facility in 2017 but, in any event, it will mature on January 2, 2018. While we are currently working on various financing alternatives that would replace or renew our revolving credit facility or senior loan facility, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nUntil we are able to finally resolve the issue described above, we may continue to experience liquidity issues. The Restructuring, which provided additional borrowing capacity, and the debt exchange which reduced our indebtedness expense and allows us to pay interest in kind, provided significant levels of short term liquidity which should mitigated the acuteness of this issue, but there can be no assurance that it will solve the issue of our need to monetize our Tax Credits.\nOur operations are subject to weather and seasonality, which may affect our ability to timely complete projects.\nOur seismic data acquisition services are performed outdoors and often in difficult or harsh climate conditions, and are therefore subject to weather and seasonality. In Canada and Alaska, the primary season for seismic data acquisition is during the winter, from December to April, as many areas are only accessible when the ground is frozen. The weather conditions during this time of year can affect the timing and efficiency of operations. In addition, this prime season can be shortened by warmer weather conditions.\nIn South America and Southeast Asia, our operations are affected by the periods of heavy rain in the areas where seismic operations are conducted. In all areas in which we operate, the weather is an uncontrollable factor that affects our operations at various times of the year. Due to the unpredictability of weather conditions, there may be times when adverse conditions may cause our operations to be delayed and result in additional costs and may negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to delays related to obtaining government permits and land access rights from third parties which could result in delays affecting our results of operations.\nOur seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by our inability to obtain timely right of way usage from both public and private land and/or mineral owners. We cannot begin surveys on property without obtaining any required permits from governmental entities as well as the permission of the private landowners who own the land being surveyed. In recent years, it has become more difficult, costly and time-consuming to obtain access rights of way as drilling activities have expanded into more populated areas. Additionally, while landowners generally are cooperative in granting access rights, some have become more resistant to seismic and drilling activities occurring on their property. In addition, governmental entities do not always grant permits within the time periods expected. Delays associated with obtaining such permits and rights of way may negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur backlog can vary significantly from time to time and our backlog estimates are based on certain assumptions and are subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and thus may not be timely converted to revenues in any particular fiscal period, if at all, or be indicative of our actual operating results for any future period.\nOur backlog estimates represent those projects for which a customer has executed a contract or signed a binding letter of award. Our backlog can vary significantly from time to time, particularly if the backlog is made up of multi-year contracts with some of our more significant customers. Backlog estimates are based on a number of assumptions and estimates including assumptions related to foreign exchange rates and proportionate performance of contracts. The realization of our backlog estimates is further affected by our performance under term rate contracts, as the early or late completion of a project under term rate contracts will generally result in decreased or increased, as the case may be, revenues derived from those projects. Contracts for services are also occasionally modified by mutual consent and often can be terminated for convenience by the customer. Because of potential changes in the scope or schedule of our customers\u2019 projects, and the possibility of early termination of customer contracts, we cannot predict with certainty when or if our backlog will be realized. Material delays, payment defaults or cancellations on the underlying contracts could reduce the amount of backlog currently reported and, consequently, could inhibit the conversion of that backlog into revenues. In addition, worsening overall market conditions could result in further reductions of backlog which will impact our financial performance.\nWe face intense competition in our business that could result in downward pricing pressure and the loss of market share.\nCompetition among seismic contractors historically has been, and likely will continue to be, intense. Competitive factors have in recent years included price, crew experience, asset availability and capacity, technological expertise and reputation for quality and dependability. We also face increasing competition from nationally owned companies in various international jurisdictions that operate under less significant financial constraints than those we experience. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources, more customers, greater market recognition and more established relationships and alliances in the industry than we do. They and other competitors may be better positioned to withstand and adjust more quickly to volatile market conditions, such as fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and production levels, as well as changes in government regulations. Additionally, the seismic data acquisition business is extremely price competitive and has a history of protracted periods of months or years where seismic contractors under financial duress bid jobs at unattractive pricing levels and therefore adversely affect industry\npricing. Competition from those and other competitors could result in downward pricing pressure, which could adversely affect our margins, and could result in the loss of market share.\nCapital requirements for the technology we use can be significant. If we are unable to finance these requirements, we may not be able to maintain our competitive advantage.\nSeismic data acquisition technologies historically have steadily improved and progressed, and, over the long-term, we expect this trend to continue. Manufacturers of seismic equipment may develop new systems that have competitive advantages relative to systems now in use that either render the equipment we currently use obsolete or require us to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain our competitive position. In order to remain competitive, we may need to continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities.\nOur capital requirements, which are primarily the cost of equipment, historically have been significant. We attempt to minimize our capital expenditures by restricting our purchase of equipment to equipment that we believe will remain highly utilized, and we strategically rent equipment utilizing the most current technology to cover peak periods in equipment demands. We may not be able to finance all of our capital requirements, however, when and if needed, to acquire new equipment. If we are unable to do so, there may be a material negative impact on our operations and financial condition. Under our current business model, however, capital expenditures will be kept at minimum levels other than for maintenance expenditures until we see improvement in the market for seismic services. While we own or can rent the equipment needed for our current levels of business, long-term limiting our capital expenditures may result in an increased competitive disadvantage.\nOur revenues are generated by a concentrated number of customers.\nWe derive our revenues from a concentrated customer base in the international oil and natural gas industry. Although we historically have not been dependent on any one customer, recently we had one customer that has represented a significant portion of our accounts receivable. Our largest customers can and typically do change from year to year and our largest customers in any one year may not be indicative of our largest customers in the future. If any of our customers were to terminate their contract with us on a large project or fail to contract for our services in the future because they are acquired, alter their exploration or development strategy, experience financial difficulties, as a result of concerns over our current cash flow and liquidity difficulties or for any other reason, and we were not able to replace their business with business from other customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe operate under hazardous conditions that subject us and our employees to risk of damage to property or personal injury and limitations on our insurance coverage may expose us to potentially significant liability costs.\nOur activities are often conducted in dangerous environments and include hazardous conditions, including operation of heavy equipment, the detonation of explosives, and operations in remote areas of developing countries. Operating in such environments, and under such conditions, carries with it inherent risks, such as loss of human life or equipment, as well as the risk of downtime or reduced productivity resulting from equipment failures caused by an adverse operating environment. Those risks could cause us to experience injuries to our personnel, equipment losses, and interruptions in our business.\nAlthough we maintain insurance, our insurance contains certain coverage exclusions and policy limits. There can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or adequate to cover all losses or liabilities or that insurance will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers as such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage. A claim for which we are not fully insured, or which is excluded from coverage or exceeds the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may be held liable for the actions of our subcontractors.\nWe often work as the general contractor on seismic data acquisition surveys and consequently engage a number of subcontractors to perform services and provide products. While we generally obtain contractual indemnification and insurance covering the acts of those subcontractors, and require the subcontractors to obtain insurance for our benefit, there can be no assurance we will not be held liable for the actions of those subcontractors. In addition, subcontractors may cause damage or injury to our personnel and property that is not fully covered by insurance or by claims against the subcontractors.\nOur agreements with our customers may not adequately protect us from unforeseen events or address all issues that could arise with our customers. The occurrence of unforeseen events or disputes with customers could result in increased liability, costs and expenses for our projects.\nWe enter into master service agreements with many of our customers that allocate certain operational risks. Despite the inclusion of risk allocation provisions in our agreements, our operations may be affected by a number of events that are unforeseen or not within our control and our agreements may not adequately protect us from each possible event. If an event occurs which we have not contemplated or otherwise addressed in our agreement we, and not our customer, will likely bear the increased cost or liability.\nTo the extent our agreements do not adequately address those and other issues, or we are not able to successfully resolve resulting disputes, we may incur increased liability, costs and expenses. This may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe, along with our customers, are subject to compliance with governmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and may adversely affect the demand for our services.\nOur operations, and those of our customers, are subject to a variety of federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, including stringent laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, particularly those relating to emissions to air, discharges to water, treatment, storage and disposal of regulated materials and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. Those laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our operations including:\n\u2022\nthe acquisition of permits before commencing regulated activities; and\n\u2022\nthe limitation or prohibition of seismic activities in environmentally sensitive or protected areas such as wetlands or wilderness areas.\nNumerous governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) and analogous state agencies in the United States and governmental bodies with control over environmental matters in foreign jurisdictions, have the power to enforce compliance with those laws and regulations and any permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions. We may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions, remediation costs and natural resource damage claims, or experience interruptions in our operations for violations or liabilities arising under these laws and regulations. Further, we may become liable for damages against which we cannot adequately insure or against which we may elect not to insure because of high costs or other reasons. Our customers are subject to similar environmental laws and regulations.\nWe expend financial and managerial resources to comply with all the laws and regulations applicable to our operations. Any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly regulations, or that change waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. The fact that such laws or regulations change frequently makes it impossible for us to predict the cost or impact of such laws and regulations on our future operations. The costs of complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations are likely to increase over time and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance with respect to existing or new laws and regulations or that such compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, or on the operations of our customers which could affect demand for our services. Although regulatory developments that may occur in subsequent years could have the effect of reducing industry activity, we cannot predict the nature of any new restrictions or regulations that may be imposed. We may be required to increase operating expenses or capital expenditures in order to comply with any new restrictions or regulations.\nIn addition, as a result of the mobility of our equipment, operations in foreign jurisdictions and the utilization of a multi-national work force, we and our customers are subject to various federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations in the United States and foreign jurisdictions relating to the import or export of equipment and the immigration and employment of non-citizen employees or sub-contractors. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and analogous governmental bodies in foreign jurisdictions have laws and regulations which prohibit or restrict operations in certain jurisdictions and doing business with certain persons in such jurisdictions, and we and our customers may be required to obtain and maintain licenses, permits, visas and similar documentation for operations. We may incur substantial costs, including fines and damages, criminal or civil sanctions for violations or liabilities arising under these laws and regulations.\nOur operations outside of the United States are subject to additional political, economic, and other risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, and our exposure to such risks will increase as we expand our international operations.\nOur operations outside of North America accounted for a substantial portion of our consolidated income. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in any business operating in foreign countries, and especially those operating in emerging markets. As we continue to increase our presence in those countries, our operations will continue to encounter the following risks, among others:\n\u2022\ngovernment instability or armed conflict, which can cause our potential customers to withdraw or delay investment in capital projects, thereby reducing or eliminating the viability of some markets for our services;\n\u2022\npotential expropriation, seizure, nationalization or detention of assets;\n\u2022\nrisks relating to foreign currency, as described below;\n\u2022\nimport/export quotas or unexpected changes in regulatory environments and trade barriers;\n\u2022\ncivil uprisings, riots and war, which can make it unsafe to continue operations, adversely affect both budgets and schedules and expose us to losses;\n\u2022\navailability of suitable personnel and equipment, which can be affected by government policy, or changes in policy, which limit the importation of qualified crew members or specialized equipment in areas where local resources are insufficient, and legal restrictions or other limitations on our ability to dismiss employees;\n\u2022\nlaws, regulations, decrees and court decisions under legal systems that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively applied and cause us to incur unanticipated and/or unrecoverable costs, as well as delays which may result in real or opportunity costs; and\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks, including kidnappings of our personnel.\nIf any of those or other similar events should occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation in many foreign jurisdictions and the final determination of our tax liabilities involves the interpretation of the statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide. Our tax returns are subject to routine examination by taxing authorities, and those examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes, penalties and/or interest.\nOur overall success as a global business depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing economic, social and political conditions. We may not succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business, and we may experience project disruptions and losses, which could negatively affect our profitability.\nOur results of operations can be significantly affected by foreign currency fluctuations and regulations.\nA portion of our revenues is derived in the local currencies of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Accordingly, we are subject to risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In the future, and especially as we further expand our operations in international markets, our customers may increasingly make payments in non-U.S. currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our revenues, operating costs and operating margins. In addition, currency devaluation can result in a loss to us if we hold deposits of that currency. Hedging foreign currencies can be difficult, especially if the currency is not actively traded. We cannot predict the effect of future exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results.\nIn addition, we are subject to risks relating to governmental regulation of foreign currency, which may limit our ability to:\n\u2022\ntransfer funds from or convert currencies in certain countries;\n\u2022\nrepatriate foreign currency received in excess of local currency requirements; and\n\u2022\nrepatriate funds held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States at favorable tax rates.\nAs we continue to develop our operations in foreign countries, there is an increased risk that foreign currency controls may create difficulty in repatriating profits from foreign countries in the form of taxes or other restrictions, which could restrict our cash flow.\nEconomic and political conditions in Latin America pose numerous risks to our operations.\nOur business operations in the Latin American region constitute a material portion of our business. As events in the region have demonstrated, negative economic or political developments in one country in the region can lead to or exacerbate economic or political instability elsewhere in the region. Furthermore, events in recent years in other developing markets have placed pressures on the stability of the currencies of a number of countries in Latin America in which we operate, including Brazil, Colombia and Peru. While certain areas in the Latin American region have experienced economic growth, this recovery remains fragile.\nCertain Latin American economies have experienced shortages in foreign currency reserves and have adopted restrictions on the use of certain mechanisms to expatriate local earnings and convert local currencies into U.S. Dollars. Any such shortages or restrictions may limit or impede our ability to transfer or to convert such currencies into U.S. Dollars and to expatriate such funds for the purpose of making timely payments of interest and principal on our indebtedness. In addition, currency devaluations in one country may have adverse effects in another country. Some Latin American countries have historically experienced high rates of inflation. Inflation and some measures implemented to curb inflation have had significant negative effects on the economies of these countries. Governmental actions taken in an effort to curb inflation, coupled with speculation about possible future actions, have contributed to economic uncertainty at times in most Latin American countries. These countries may experience high levels of inflation in the future that could lead to further government intervention in the economy, including the introduction of government policies that could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if any of these countries experience high rates of inflation, we may not be able to adjust the price of our services sufficiently to offset the effects of inflation on our cost structures. A high inflation environment would also have negative effects on the level of economic activity and employment and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCurrent and future legislation or regulation relating to climate change and hydraulic fracturing could negatively affect the exploration and production of oil and gas and adversely affect demand for our services.\nIn response to concerns suggesting that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d (\u201cGHG\u201d) (including carbon dioxide and methane), may be contributing to global climate change, legislative and regulatory measures to address the concerns are in various phases of discussion or implementation at the federal, state and international levels. Many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have already taken legal measures intended to reduce GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or GHG cap and trade programs.\nAlthough various climate change legislative measures have been under consideration by the U.S. Congress, it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may act on climate change legislation. The EPA has promulgated a series of rulemakings and taken other actions that the EPA states will result in the regulation of GHG as \u201cair pollutants\u201d under the existing federal Clean Air Act. Furthermore, in 2010, EPA regulations became effective that require monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions on an annual basis, including extensive GHG monitoring and reporting requirements. While this rule does not control GHG emission levels from any facilities, it will cause covered facilities to incur monitoring and reporting costs. Moreover, lawsuits have been filed seeking to require individual companies to reduce GHG emissions from their operations.\nThis increasing focus on global warming may result in new environmental laws or regulations that may negatively affect us and our customers. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us. Moreover, passage of climate change legislation or other legislative or regulatory initiatives that regulate or restrict emissions of GHG may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas in areas where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services. Reductions in our revenues or increases in our expenses as a result of climate control initiatives could have adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and natural gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production. Due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting, reporting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. These legislative and regulatory initiatives imposing additional reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult or costly to complete oil and natural gas wells. Shale gas and shale oil cannot be economically produced without extensive fracturing. In the event such initiatives are successful, demand for our seismic acquisition services may be adversely affected.\nAs a company subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), our business may suffer because our efforts to comply with U.S. laws could restrict our ability to do business in foreign markets relative to our competitors who are not subject to U.S. law. Any determination that we or our foreign agents have violated the FCPA may adversely affect our business, operations and reputation.\nWe operate in certain parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business, licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or using other methods that U.S. law and regulations prohibit us from using.\nAs a U.S. corporation, we are subject to the regulations imposed by the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and which imposes stringent recordkeeping requirements. In particular, we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners even though our partners are not subject to the FCPA. Any such violations could result in substantial civil and/or criminal penalties and might adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to continue to work in those countries.\nThe enactment of legislation implementing changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws affecting the taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nChanges to U.S. or foreign tax laws could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. Due to the scope of our international business operations, any changes in the U.S. or foreign taxation of these operations may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. The international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure may expose us to potentially adverse tax consequences. We are subject to taxation in and to the tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. We are also subject to intercompany pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds between our companies. Adverse developments in these laws or regulations, or any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of these laws or regulations in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction, including the United States, may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, including the tax treatment or characterization of our indebtedness, intercompany loans and guarantees. If any applicable tax authorities, including the U.S. tax authorities, were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could result in the disallowance of deductions and the imposition of tax withholding.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain executive officers and skilled and technically knowledgeable employees, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur continued success depends upon retaining and attracting executive officers and highly skilled employees. A number of our executive officers and employees possess many years of industry experience and are highly skilled, and members of our management team also have relationships with oil and gas companies and others in the industry that are integral to our ability to market and sell our services. Our inability to retain such individuals could adversely affect our ability to compete in the seismic service industry. We may face significant competition for such skilled personnel, particularly during periods of increased demand for seismic services. Although we utilize employment agreements and other incentives to retain certain of our key employees, there is no guarantee that we will be able to retain those personnel.\nIf we do not manage growth and contractions in our business effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nHistorically, we have experienced significant growth but for the last several years we have contracted our business in response to the decline in oil and natural gas exploration activities. Both growth and contraction have placed significant demands on our personnel, management, infrastructure and support mechanisms and other resources. We must continue to improve our operational, financial, management, legal compliance and information systems to keep pace with the growth of or contractions in our business. We may also expand through the strategic acquisition of companies and assets. We must plan and manage any acquisitions effectively to achieve revenue growth and maintain profitability in our evolving market. If we fail to manage growth of or contractions in our business effectively, our ability to provide services could be adversely affected, which could negatively affect our operating results.\nThe requirements of being a public company increase our operating expenses and divert management\u2019s attention.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations require us to incur significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we would not incur if we were not a public company.\nThe Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the national securities exchanges, establish certain requirements for the corporate governance practices of public companies. For example, as a result of becoming a public company, we have additional board committees and are required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight are\nrequired. As a result, management\u2019s attention has been and will continue to be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results.\nBecause we are a smaller reporting company, to date our independent auditor has not been required to issue an attestation report regarding our internal control over financial reporting in the annual reports on Form 10-K that we file with the SEC, and we have been subject to scaled disclosure requirements. We will remain a smaller reporting company as long as the market value of our securities held by non-affiliates is below $75 million, as of the end of our second fiscal quarter each year. If we cease to be a smaller reporting company, our expenses will further increase and additional time will be required of our management to comply with those additional requirements.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations.\nWhile the Restructuring we completed on July 27, 2016 caused our total debt outstanding to significantly decrease from our total debt outstanding on June 30, 2016, our high level of indebtedness could still have significant effects on our business. For example, our level of indebtedness and the terms of our debt agreements may:\n\u2022\nincrease the risk that we may default on our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nprevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase second lien notes or senior secured notes tendered to us if there is a change of control (as defined in the indentures for the second lien notes and the senior secured notes) or other event requiring such a repurchase, and any failure to repurchase second lien notes or senior secured notes tendered for repurchase would constitute a default under the indentures for our notes and may constitute a default under other debt;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments, or general corporate purposes particularly in light of the fact that a substantial portion of our assets have been pledged to secure our indebtedness, which may limit the ability to execute our business strategy;\n\u2022\nheighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or in the general economy and restrict us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that may have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022\nlimit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate or the general economy; and\n\u2022\nresult in higher interest expense if interest rates increase and we have outstanding floating rate borrowings.\nEach of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to make payments with respect to our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance, which will be affected by a broad range of factors, including our ability to monetize our Tax Credits, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affecting us and our industry, many of which are beyond our control.\nDespite existing debt levels, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt, which would increase the risks associated with our leverage.\nEven with our existing debt levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional debt in the future, including debt under our revolving credit facility. Although our revolving credit facility matures on November 6, 2017, our borrowing base has been reduced and the terms of our debt agreements limit our ability to incur additional debt, these terms may not prevent us from incurring amounts of additional debt. In addition, we are working on various financing alternatives that would replace or renew our revolving credit facility or senior loan facility, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms, or at all. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, however, the risks associated with our leverage may intensify.\nOur debt agreements impose or may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries that may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business.\nOur debt agreements contain covenants that restrict our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to take various actions, such as:\n\u2022\ntransferring or selling certain assets;\n\u2022\npaying dividends or distributions, repaying subordinated indebtedness (if any) or making certain investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nincurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness or, with respect to our restricted subsidiaries, issuing preferred stock;\n\u2022\ncreating or incurring liens securing indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincurring dividend or similar payment restrictions affecting restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nconsummating a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 assets;\n\u2022\nentering into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nengaging in a business other than our current business and businesses related, ancillary or complementary, to our current businesses or immaterial businesses.\nIn addition, the security documents relating to our indebtedness restrict us and our restricted subsidiaries from taking or omitting to take certain actions that would adversely affect or impair in any material respect the collateral securing those obligations. Any future debt may also require us to comply with a number of affirmative and negative covenants in addition to the covenants listed above.\nWhile we are currently working on various financing alternatives that could replace ore renew our revolving credit facility or our senior loan facility, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms, or at all, or that more restrictive terms will not be imposed upon us in any of our new debt agreements.\nWe may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise if we fail to meet certain financial ratios or because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under these agreements. In addition, the restrictions contained in our debt agreements may also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs, or may otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions, execute our business strategy, effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted or engage in other business activities that would be in our interest. In the future, we may incur other debt obligations that might subject us to additional and different restrictive covenants that could also adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility. In the event that we default under any of these financial or other covenants, we would be required to seek waivers or amendments to the applicable agreements or to refinance the applicable indebtedness, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to do so on terms we deem acceptable, or at all. Failure to comply with applicable covenants would constitute a default under the applicable debt instrument and would generally allow the applicable lenders or other debt holders to demand immediate repayment of all indebtedness outstanding thereunder and, in the case of secured indebtedness and subject to the intercreditor agreement, if applicable, to seize and sell the collateral and to apply the proceeds from those sales to satisfy such indebtedness, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. These events would likely in turn trigger cross-acceleration and cross-default rights under other debt agreements, which would allow the applicable lenders or other debt holders to exercise similar rights and remedies. If the amounts outstanding under any of our debt agreements were to be accelerated or if the applicable lenders or other debt holders were to foreclose upon the collateral securing any such indebtedness, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay the money owed to our lenders. We have in the past failed to comply with financial and other covenants in debt and have therefore been required to obtain waivers and amendments from prior lenders, and there can be no assurance that we will not experience similar defaults in the future or that waivers or amendments will be obtained.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends;\n\u2022\nrepay subordinated debt prior to its maturity;\n\u2022\ngrant additional liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\nrepurchase stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments or acquisitions of substantially all or a portion of another entity\u2019s business assets;\n\u2022\nundergo a change of control; and\n\u2022\nmerge with another entity or dispose of our assets.\nComplying with these covenants, or the covenants of any new debt agreements we may enter into to renew or replace our existing debt agreements, may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities that would otherwise be available to us.\nIf we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements, there could be a default under the terms of such agreements, which could result in an acceleration of repayment and the sale of our assets to satisfy our obligations with our lenders. Failure to maintain existing financing or to secure new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position.\nIf we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements, there could be a default under the terms of those agreements. In the event of a default under those agreements, lenders could terminate their commitments to lend or accelerate the loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. Borrowings under other debt that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, may also be accelerated and become due and payable. In addition, substantially all of our debt obligations are secured by a lien on substantially all of our U.S. assets and certain of our foreign assets, including 65% of the equity interests in our first-tier foreign subsidiaries. In the event of foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding relating to us or to our subsidiaries that have guaranteed our debt, holders of our secured indebtedness and our other lenders will have prior claims on our assets. If any of those events occur, our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to find alternative financing. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Additionally, we may not be able to amend our debt agreements or obtain needed waivers on satisfactory terms or without incurring substantial costs. Failure to maintain existing or secure new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities and the Restructuring\nThere is a limited trading market for our securities and the market price of our securities is subject to volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, and the level of trading that develops with our common stock may be affected by, numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things, our reverse stock split, our new capital structure as a result of our Restructuring, our limited trading history subsequent to our Restructuring, our historically limited trading volume, the concentration of holdings of our common stock, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results and cash flow, business conditions in our markets and the general state of the securities markets and the market for energy-related stocks, as well as general economic and market conditions and other factors that may affect our future results, including those that are described elsewhere in our Risk Factors. While initially there has been significant trading in our common stock after our Restructuring as the market adjusts to our recapitalization and reverse stock split, no assurance can be given that an active market will continue for our common stock or as to the liquidity of the trading market for our common stock. Long term holders of our common stock may experience difficulty in reselling, or an inability to sell, their shares. In addition, if an active trading market is not maintained, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe composition of our board changed significantly.\nUnder the Restructuring, the composition of our board changed significantly. Our board is now made up of seven directors, of which four have not previously served on our board. The new directors have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on our board and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine our future. There is no guarantee that the new board will pursue, or will pursue in the same manner, our current strategic plans. As a result, the future strategy and plans may differ materially from those of the past.\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nFunds associated with Whitebox Advisors LLC (\"Whitebox\") and BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC (\"BlueMountain\")currently own a majority of our outstanding common stock and each is a lender under the terms of our second lien notes and senior loan facility. Circumstances may arise in which these stockholders may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional shares or debt that, in their judgment, could enhance their\ninvestment in us or another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our common stock. Furthermore, our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides for certain continuing nomination rights relating to two of our board member positions, subject to certain conditions on share ownership. In addition, our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common shares because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with a significant concentration of stockholders.\nOur financial results after the Restructuring may not reflect historical trends.\nAs a result of our Restructuring, our historical financial performance, particularly our earnings per share, may not be indicative of our financial performance after the Restructuring.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We currently do not have and may not obtain research coverage of our common stock by securities and industry analysts. Even if we get coverage, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if we do get coverage, if one or more of the analysts who might cover us downgrades our common stock or publishes unfavorable research, ceases to cover us, or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume may decline.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the near future.\nWe do not anticipate that cash dividends or other distributions will be paid with respect to our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, restrictive covenants in certain debt agreements to which we are, or may be, a party, may limit our ability to pay dividends or for us to receive dividends from our operating companies, any of which may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that some stockholders may consider beneficial.\nCertain provisions of our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our board determines that such changes in control are not in our best interests and in the best interests of our stockholders. Those provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include, among other things, those that:\n\u2022\nlimit the ability of stockholders to nominate or remove directors\u037e\n\u2022\nauthorize our board to issue preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval\u037e\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice procedures for nominating directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings\u037e and\n\u2022\nlimit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders.\nWhile these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our board, they could enable the board to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some stockholders may believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.", "PERMNO": 13330, "SIC": 1382, "TIC": "SAEXQ"}
