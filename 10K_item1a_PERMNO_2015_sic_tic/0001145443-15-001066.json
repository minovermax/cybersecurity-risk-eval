RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information contained in this Form 10-K, investors should carefully consider the following factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical fact are \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d for purposes of these provisions, including any statements regarding: projections of revenues, research and development expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses, other expenses, gross profit, gross margin, order backlog or other financial items; the plans and objectives of management for future operations; the implementation of advanced process technologies; our tax rate; the adequacy of allowances for returns, price protection and other concessions; future demand for legacy products; proposed new products or services; the sufficiency of cash generated from operations and cash balances; our exposure to interest rate risk; future economic conditions or performance; plans to focus on cost control; plans to seek intellectual property protection for our technologies; expectations regarding export sales and net revenues; the expansion of sales efforts; acquisition prospects; the results of our possible future acquisitions; technological trends; and assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d or \u201ccontinue,\u201d or the negative thereof or other comparable terminology. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations or any of the forward-looking statements will prove to be correct, and actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Our future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report. All forward-looking statements and reasons why results may differ included in this Annual Report are made as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statement or reason why actual results may differ.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS\nIn the past, our operating results have varied significantly and are likely to fluctuate in the future, making it difficult to predict our future operating results.\nWe continue to face a challenging business environment and limited visibility on end-market demands. Wide varieties of factors affect our operating results, many of which are beyond our control. These factors and risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in the quantity of our products sold;\n\u2022\nchanges in the average selling price of our products;\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the semiconductor industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in our product mix;\n\u2022\na change in the gross margins of our products;\n\u2022\nthe operating results of the FCP product line, which normally has a lower profit margin than IC products;\n\u2022\nexpenses incurred in obtaining, enforcing, and defending intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe timing of new product introductions and announcements by us and by our competitors;\n\u2022\ncustomer acceptance of new products introduced by us;\n\u2022\ndelay or decline in orders received from distributors;\n\u2022\ngrowth or reduction in the size of the market for interface ICs;\n\u2022\nthe availability of manufacturing capacity with our wafer suppliers, especially to support sales growth and new products;\n\u2022\nchanges in manufacturing costs;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in manufacturing yields;\n\u2022\ndisqualification by our customers for quality or performance related issues;\n\u2022\nthe ability of customers to pay us;\n\u2022\nincreased research and development expenses associated with new product introductions or process changes;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of our intangible assets or other long-lived assets; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our effective tax rate from quarter to quarter.\nAll of these factors are difficult to forecast and could seriously harm our operating results. Our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future sales and are largely fixed in the short term. Therefore, we may be unable to reduce our expenses fast enough to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in sales. Any significant decline in demand relative to our expectations or any material delay of customer orders could harm our operating results. In addition, if our operating results in future quarters fall below public market analysts\u2019 and investors\u2019 expectations, the market price of our common stock would likely decrease.\nThe demand for our products depends on the growth of our end users\u2019 markets.\nOur continued success depends in large part on the continued growth of markets for the products into which our semiconductor and frequency control products are incorporated. These markets include the following:\n\u2022\ncomputers, notebooks, tablets and connectivity to related peripherals;\n\u2022\ndata communications and telecommunications equipment including switches and routers;\n\u2022\nservers and storage equipment including cloud computing requirements;\n\u2022\nconsumer electronics equipment; and\n\u2022\nembedded systems including video surveillance, medical and automotive.\nAny decline in the demand for products in these markets could seriously harm our business, financial condition and operating results. These markets have also historically experienced significant fluctuations in demand, and over the past two years we\u2019ve been impacted by declines in the markets for PC\u2019s and notebook computers. We may also be seriously harmed by slower growth in the other markets in which we sell our products.\nCustomer demands for the Company\u2019s products are volatile and difficult to predict.\nOur business is characterized by short-term orders and shipment schedules. We do not have long-term purchase agreements with any of our customers. Customers can typically cancel or reschedule their orders without significant penalty. We typically plan production and inventory levels based on forecasts of customer demand generated with\ninput from customers and sales representatives. Our customers continuously adjust their inventories in response to changes in end market demand for their products and the availability of semiconductor components. This results in frequent changes in demand for our products. Accordingly, we must rely on multiple assumptions to forecast customer demand. Various external factors that are outside of our control can make it difficult to accurately make such forecasts, and the volatility of customer demand limits our ability to predict future levels of sales and profitability.\nFurther, as end customer demand can change very quickly, the supply of semiconductors can quickly and unexpectedly match or exceed demand. Also, semiconductor suppliers can rapidly increase production output. This can lead to a sudden oversupply situation and a subsequent reduction in order rates and revenues as customers adjust their inventories to true demand rates. A rapid and sudden decline in customer demand for our products can result in excess quantities of certain of our products relative to demand. Under such circumstances, we may be required to record significant provisions for excess and obsolete inventories. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, and our financial results could be harmed if we do not successfully develop and implement new manufacturing technologies or develop, introduce and sell new products.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, frequent new product introductions and declining selling prices over product life cycles. We currently offer a comprehensive portfolio of silicon and quartz based products. Our future success depends upon the timely completion and introduction of new products, across all our product lines, at competitive price and performance levels. The success of new products depends on a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nproduct performance and functionality;\n\u2022\ncustomer acceptance;\n\u2022\ncompetitive cost structure and pricing;\n\u2022\nsuccessful and timely completion of product development;\n\u2022\nsufficient wafer fabrication capacity; and\n\u2022\nachievement of acceptable manufacturing yields by our wafer suppliers.\nOur failure to successfully develop new products that achieve market acceptance in a timely fashion and that can be efficiently and successfully integrated with our customers\u2019 products could adversely affect our ability to grow our business and improve our operating results. The development, introduction and market acceptance of new products is critical to our ability to sustain and grow our business. Any failure to successfully develop, introduce, market and sell new products could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe may also experience delays, difficulty in procuring adequate fabrication capacity for the development and manufacture of new products, or other difficulties in achieving volume production of these products. Even relatively minor errors may significantly affect the development and manufacture of new products. If we fail to complete and introduce new products in a timely manner at competitive price and performance levels, our business would be significantly harmed.\nIf we do not develop products that our customers and end-users design into their products, or if their products do not sell successfully, our business and operating results would be harmed.\nWe have relied in the past and continue to rely upon our relationships with our customers and end-users for insights into product development strategies for emerging system requirements. We generally incorporate new products into a customer\u2019s or end-user\u2019s product or system at the design stage. Our success has been, and will continue to be, dependent upon manufacturers designing our connectivity products into their products. To achieve design wins, which are decisions by manufacturers to design our products into their systems, we must define and deliver cost effective and innovative connectivity solutions on a timely basis that satisfy the manufacturers\u2019 requirements and specifications. Our ability to achieve design wins is subject to numerous risks including competitive pressures as well as technological risks and delays in our product development cycle. However, these design efforts, which can often require significant expenditures by us, may precede product sales, if any, by a year or more. With the increasing complexity of new generation products the development cost of each new product increases, making the selection\nprocess ever more critical with limited staff and financial resources. Moreover, the value to us of any design win will depend in large part on the ultimate success of the customer or end-user\u2019s product and on the extent to which the system\u2019s design accommodates components manufactured by our competitors. If we fail to achieve design wins or if the design wins fail to result in significant future revenues, our operating results would be harmed. If we have problems developing or maintaining our relationships with our customers and end-users, our ability to develop well-accepted new products may be impaired.\nIntense competition in the semiconductor industry may reduce the demand for our products or the prices of our products, which could reduce our revenues and gross profits and limit our ability to maintain or grow our business.\nThe semiconductor industry is intensely competitive, and we expect competition in this industry to continue to increase. This competition has resulted in rapid technological change, evolving standards, reductions in product selling prices and rapid product obsolescence leading to excess and obsolete inventory writedowns (for further detail, see Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Policies - Inventories). If we are unable to successfully meet these competitive challenges, we may be unable to maintain and grow our business. Any inability on our part to compete successfully would also adversely affect our results of operations and impair our financial condition.\nOur competitors include Analog Devices, Avago Technologies, Cypress Semiconductor, Fairchild Semiconductor, Hitachi, Integrated Device Technology, Maxim Integrated Products, Motorola, On Semiconductor, NXP, Parade Technologies, Silicon Laboratories, STMicroelectronics, Texas Instruments, and Toshiba. Most of those competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, broader product lines and longer-standing customer relationships than we do. We also compete with other major or emerging companies that sell products to certain segments of our markets. Competitors with greater financial resources or broader product lines may have a greater ability to sustain price reductions in our primary markets in order to gain or maintain market share.\nWe believe that our future success will depend on our ability to continue to improve and develop our products and processes. Unlike us, many of our competitors maintain internal manufacturing capacity for the fabrication and assembly of semiconductor products. This ability may provide them with more reliable manufacturing capability, shorter development and manufacturing cycles and time-to-market advantages. In addition, competitors with their own wafer fabrication facilities that are capable of producing products with the same design geometries as ours may be able to manufacture and sell competitive products at lower prices. Any introduction of products by our competitors that are manufactured with improved process technology could seriously harm our business. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, our competitors have developed and marketed products that function similarly or identically to ours. If our products do not achieve performance, price, size or other advantages over products offered by our competitors, we might lose market share. Competitive pressures could also reduce market acceptance of our products, reduce our prices and increase our expenses.\nWe also face competition from the makers of ASICs and other system devices. These devices may include interface logic functions that may eliminate the need or sharply reduce the demand for our products in particular applications.\nDownturns in the semiconductor industry, rapidly changing technology, accelerated selling price erosion and evolving industry standards can harm our operating results.\nThe semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical and periodically subject to significant economic downturns, characterized by diminished product demand, accelerated erosion of selling prices, overcapacity and excess and obsolete inventory as well as rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. In the future, we may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in our business and operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions, overall economic conditions or other factors. Our business is also subject to the risks associated with the effects of legislation and regulations relating to the import or export of semiconductor products.\nPast domestic and worldwide economic conditions adversely affected us, and future economic conditions could have adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur revenues and earnings have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future. General economic or other conditions could cause a downturn in the market for our products or technology. In the past, financial disruptions affecting the banking system, investment banks, insurance companies and the financial markets negatively impacted general domestic and global economic conditions. These economic conditions have resulted in our facing very challenging periods leading to reduced sales and earnings.\nOur sales have been adversely impacted due to continued economic softness in many parts of the world and only tepid growth in others. There could be a number of effects on our business that could also adversely affect our operating results. Disruptions may result in the insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays; the inability of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and/or customer insolvencies that cause our customers to change delivery schedules, cancel or reduce orders; a slowdown in global economies which could result in lower end-user demand for our products; and increased impairments of our investments. Net income could vary from expectations depending on the gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities, gains or losses from equity method investments, and impairment charges related to intangible assets, long-term assets, investments and marketable securities. Our cash and marketable securities investments represent significant assets that may be subject to fluctuating or even negative returns depending upon interest rate movements and financial market conditions in fixed income securities.\nVolatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty increases the risk of substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations in our earnings. Given the current economic environment, we remain cautious and we expect our customers to be cautious as well, which could affect our future results. If the economic recovery slows down or dissipates, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe complexity of our products makes us susceptible to manufacturing problems, which could increase our costs and delay our product shipments.\nThe manufacture and assembly of our products is highly complex and sensitive to a wide variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment;\n\u2022\nimpurities in the materials used; and\n\u2022\nthe performance of manufacturing personnel and production equipment.\nIn a typical semiconductor manufacturing process, silicon wafers produced by a foundry are cut into individual die. These die are assembled into individual packages and tested for performance. Our wafer fabrication suppliers have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated yields of suitable die. In the event of such decreased yields, we would incur additional costs to sort wafers, an increase in average cost per usable die and an increase in the time to market or availability of our products. These conditions could reduce our net revenues and gross margin and harm our customer relations.\nWe rely on independent manufacturers who may not be able to meet our manufacturing requirements.\nWe do not manufacture any of our IC products. Therefore, we are referred to in the semiconductor industry as a \u201cfabless\u201d producer. We depend upon third party foundries to produce wafers and subcontractors to manufacture IC products that meet our specifications. We currently have third party manufacturers located in China, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, India, Korea and Japan that can produce products that meet our needs. However, as the industry continues to progress to smaller manufacturing and design geometries, the complexities of producing semiconductors will increase. Decreasing geometries may introduce new problems and delays that may affect product development and deliveries. Due to the nature of the industry and our status as a \u201cfabless\u201d IC semiconductor company, we could encounter fabrication-related problems that may affect the availability of our products, delay our shipments or increase our costs.\nOur contracts with our wafer suppliers do not obligate them to a minimum supply or set prices. Any inability or unwillingness of our wafer suppliers generally, and GlobalFoundries, TSMC and MagnaChip in particular, to meet our manufacturing requirements would delay our production and product shipments and harm our business.\nIn recent years, we purchased over 70% of our wafers from MagnaChip, TSMC and GlobalFoundries, with the balance from other wafer suppliers. Our reliance on independent wafer suppliers to fabricate our wafers at their production facilities subjects us to possible risks such as:\n\u2022\nlack of adequate capacity or assured product supply;\n\u2022\nlack of available manufactured products;\n\u2022\nreduced control over delivery schedules, quality assurance, manufacturing yields and production costs;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in wafer prices; and\n\u2022\nclosure of production facilities.\nAny inability or unwillingness of our wafer suppliers to provide adequate quantities of finished wafers to meet our needs in a timely manner would delay our production and product shipments and seriously harm our business. In the past, a wafer supplier shut down one of their production facilities used to manufacture our products. We transitioned the production of these products to different facilities. The transfer of production to other facilities subjects us to the above listed risks as well as potential yield or other production problems, which could arise as a result of any change.\nAt present, we purchase wafers from our suppliers through the issuance of purchase orders based on our rolling nine-month forecasts. The purchase orders are subject to acceptance by each wafer supplier. We do not have long-term supply contracts that obligate our suppliers to a minimum supply or set prices. We also depend upon our wafer suppliers to participate in process improvement efforts, such as the transition to finer geometries. If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to do so, our development and introduction of new products could be delayed. Furthermore, sudden shortages of raw materials or production capacity constraints can lead wafer suppliers to allocate available capacity to customers other than us or for their internal uses, interrupting our ability to meet our product delivery obligations. Any significant interruption in our wafer supply would seriously harm our operating results and our customer relations. Our reliance on independent wafer suppliers may also lengthen the development cycle for our products, providing time-to-market advantages to our competitors that have in-house fabrication capacity.\nIn the event that our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture our key products in required volumes, we will have to identify and qualify additional wafer foundries. The qualification process can take up to nine months or longer. Furthermore, we are unable to predict whether additional wafer foundries will become available to us or will be in a position to satisfy any of our requirements on a timely basis, or at all.\nIn the quarter ended December 27, 2014, we were notified by MagnaChip that they will close a production facility, from which we purchase wafers that support approximately 15% of our revenues, by December 2015. We are working with MagnaChip to transfer production of these wafers to one of their alternate facilities. We have successfully conducted fab transfers in the past, but we may suffer some disruption in supply that could reduce our future revenues.\nWe depend on single or limited source assembly subcontractors with whom we do not have written contracts. Any inability or unwillingness of our assembly subcontractors to meet our assembly requirements would delay our product shipments and harm our business.\nWe primarily rely on foreign subcontractors for the assembly and packaging of our products and, to a lesser extent, for the testing of finished products. Some of these subcontractors are our single source supplier for some of our packages. In addition, changes in our or a subcontractor\u2019s business could cause us to become materially dependent on a single subcontractor. We have from time to time experienced difficulties in the timeliness and quality of product deliveries from our subcontractors and may experience similar or more severe difficulties in the future. We generally purchase these single or limited source components or services pursuant to purchase orders and have no guaranteed arrangements with these subcontractors. These subcontractors could cease to meet our requirements for components or services, or there could be a significant disruption in supplies from them, or degradation in the quality of components or services supplied by them. Any circumstance that would require us to qualify alternative supply\nsources could delay shipments, result in the loss of customers and limit or reduce our revenues. Introducing new products or transferring existing products to a new third party manufacturer or process may result in unforeseen product specification and operating problems. These problems may affect our shipments and may be costly to correct.\nWe may experience integration or other problems with potential future acquisitions, which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations. New acquisitions could dilute the interests of existing stockholders, and the announcement of new acquisitions could result in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nOur previous and potential future acquisitions could result in the following:\n\u2022\nlarge one-time write-offs;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty in integrating newly-acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner;\n\u2022\nthe challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings, and other benefits from acquisitions as anticipated;\n\u2022\nthe risk of diverting the attention of senior management from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nrisks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations;\n\u2022\nthe risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies and capabilities acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets;\n\u2022\npotentially dilutive issuances of equity securities;\n\u2022\nexcessive usages of cash;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of operations, personnel, technologies, products and the information systems of the acquired companies; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating or expanding information technology systems and other financial or business processes that may lead to financial reporting issues.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may seek acquisition prospects that would complement our existing product offerings, improve our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. In addition, from time to time, we invest in other companies, without actually acquiring them, and such investments involve many of the same risks as are involved with acquisitions.\nImplementation of new Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) rules and the issuance of new corporate governance regulations or other accounting regulations, or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations, could materially impact our business or stated results.\nIn general, from time to time the government, courts and the financial accounting boards may issue new corporate governance regulations or accounting regulations, or modify or reinterpret existing ones. There may be future changes in laws, interpretations or regulations that would affect our financial results or the way in which we present them. Additionally, changes in the laws or regulations could have adverse effects on hiring and many other aspects of our business that would affect our ability to compete, both nationally and internationally.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 required the SEC to establish new disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use \u201cconflict\u201d minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. We filed our latest report with the SEC in May 2015 for the calendar year ended December 31, 2014. There will be future costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, including for due diligence in regard to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products and, beginning with the report for calendar year 2015, an audit report of our Conflict Minerals Report prepared by an independent private sector auditor. In addition, depending on the outcome of such verification activities, there may be costs of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply.\nIf we are unable to maintain processes and procedures to sustain effective internal control over our financial reporting, our ability to provide reliable and timely financial reports could be harmed and this could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nUnder the rules promulgated under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to maintain, and evaluate the effectiveness of, our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In our annual reports on Form 10-K for the years ended July 3, 2010, June 27, 2009, June 30, 2007 and July 2, 2005, we reported material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We have since remediated these deficiencies and continue to spend a significant amount of time and resources to ensure compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. As reported in Item 9A of this Form 10-K, our management does not believe that we had any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2015, and management has determined that as of June 27, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. However, we have and will continue to evolve our business in a changing marketplace. In addition, we are expanding our overseas operations, and as we grow in these locations, we may have difficulty in recruiting and retaining a complement of personnel with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, experience and training in the application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. Due to these factors, there can be no assurance that other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not arise in the future. Should we or our independent registered public accounting firm determine in future periods that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of our financial reports may be impacted, and investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price and we could suffer other materially adverse consequences.\nChanges to environmental laws and regulations applicable to manufacturers of electrical and electronic equipment are causing us to redesign our products, and may increase our costs and expose us to liability.\nThe implementation of new environmental regulatory legal requirements, such as lead free initiatives, may affect our product designs and manufacturing processes. The impact of such regulations on our product designs and manufacturing processes could affect the timing of compliant product introductions as well as their commercial success. Redesigning our products to comply with new regulations may result in increased research and development and manufacturing and quality control costs. In addition, the products we manufacture that comply with new regulatory standards may not perform as well as our current products. Moreover, if we are unable to successfully and timely redesign existing products and introduce new products that meet new standards set by environmental regulation and our customers, sales of our products could decline, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe compete with others to attract and retain key personnel, and any loss of or inability to attract key personnel would harm us.\nTo a greater degree than non-technology companies, our future success will depend on the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. None of these individuals has an employment agreement with us and each one would be difficult to replace. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of these individuals. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key personnel or the inability to continue to attract qualified personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success also will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and management personnel, particularly highly skilled design, process and test engineers, for whom competition can be intense. During strong business cycles, we expect to experience difficulty in filling our needs for qualified engineers and other personnel. If we do not succeed in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications, our revenues, operations and product development efforts could be harmed.\nOur limited ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights could harm our competitive position. Litigation regarding intellectual property could divert management attention, be costly to defend and prevent us from using or selling the challenged technology.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and licenses and preserve other intellectual property rights covering our products and development and testing tools. In the United States, we currently hold 95 patents covering certain aspects of our product designs and have five additional patent applications pending. Copyrights, mask work protection, trade secrets and confidential technological know-how are also key to our business. Additional patents may not be issued to us or our patents or other intellectual property may not provide meaningful protection. We may be subject to, or initiate, interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. These proceedings can consume significant financial and management resources. We may become involved in litigation relating to alleged infringement by us of others\u2019 patents or other intellectual property rights. This type of litigation is frequently expensive to both the winning party and the losing party and takes up significant amounts of management\u2019s time and attention. In addition, if we lose such a lawsuit, a court could require us to pay substantial damages and/or royalties or prohibit us from using essential technologies. For these and other reasons, this type of litigation could seriously harm our business. Also, although we may seek to obtain a license under a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights in order to bring an end to certain claims or actions asserted against us, we may not be able to obtain such a license on reasonable terms or at all.\nBecause it is important to our success that we are able to prevent competitors from copying our innovations, we intend to continue to seek patent, trade secret and mask work protection for our technologies. The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive, and we cannot be certain that any currently pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents, or that, even if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us. Furthermore, others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the patents we own.\nWe also rely on trade secret protection for our technology, in part through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. However, these parties may breach these agreements. In addition, the laws of some territories in which we develop, manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nOur independent foundries use a process technology that may include technology we helped develop with them, and that may generally be used by those foundries to produce their own products or to manufacture products for other companies, including our competitors. In addition, we may not have the right to implement key process technologies used to manufacture some of our products with foundries other than our present foundries.\nWe may not provide adequate allowances for exchanges, returns and concessions.\nWe recognize revenue from the sale of products when shipped, less an allowance based on future authorized and historical patterns of returns, price protection, exchanges and other concessions. We believe our methodology and approach are appropriate. However, if the actual amounts we incur exceed the allowances, it could decrease our revenue and corresponding gross profit.\nOur future tax rates and tax payments could be higher than we anticipate and may harm our results of operations.\nAs a multinational corporation, we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions. The taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions. A number of factors, including unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or by unexpected changes in existing tax laws or our interpretation of them, could unfavorably affect our future effective tax rate. In the event our management determines it is no longer more likely than not that we will realize a portion of our deferred tax assets we will be required to increase our valuation allowance which will result in an increase in our effective tax rate. Furthermore, our tax returns are subject to examination in all the jurisdictions in which we operate which subjects us to potential increases in our tax liabilities. The Internal Revenue Service completed their examination of the federal tax returns\nfor fiscal 2010 and 2011 during fiscal 2014, and the Company made additional tax payments of approximately $208,000 including interest charges for the two years that were examined.\nIn addition, in fiscal 2013 we began implementation of an operating structure to more efficiently align the Company\u2019s transaction flows with the Company\u2019s geographic business operations. As a result we formed new legal entities and realigned existing ones, completed an intercompany transfer of intellectual property rights, inventory and fixed assets across different tax jurisdictions, and implemented intercompany intellectual property licensing agreements between our U.S. and foreign entities. These changes may result in unanticipated changes to our tax rates and tax payments. All of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our liability for U.S. and foreign taxes is greater than we have anticipated and reserved for, our operating results may suffer.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions in which we do business, including China. We believe that we have adequately estimated and reserved for our income tax liability. However, our effective tax rates may not be as low as we anticipate. As of June 27, 2015, one of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries in a foreign tax jurisdiction is under audit for the years 2010 to 2013. Our business operations, including our transfer pricing for transactions among our various business entities operating in different tax jurisdictions, may be audited at any time by the U.S., Chinese or other foreign tax authorities.\nA number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates, such as:\n\u2022\nchanges in the tax laws of any of the countries in which we pay substantial taxes, including changes to tax rates or to transfer pricing standards, or more fundamental changes such as the various proposals that exist from time to time for U.S. international tax reform;\n\u2022\nchallenges to our transfer pricing methodologies;\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nchanges in U.S. general accepted accounting principles; and\n\u2022\nthe repatriation of non-U.S. earnings with respect to which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.\nA change in our effective tax rate due to any of these factors may adversely impact our future results from operations. Also, changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our ability to utilize cash in a tax efficient manner.\nA large portion of our revenues is derived from sales to a few key customers, and the loss of one or more of our key customers, or their key end user customers, could significantly reduce our revenues. In addition, our sales through distributor channels increases the complexity of our business.\nA relatively small number of key customers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues in each of the past several fiscal years. In general we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. We had two direct customers who accounted for more than 10% of net revenues during each of the fiscal years ended June 27, 2015, June 28, 2014 and June 29, 2013. As a percentage of net revenues, sales to our top five direct customers during the fiscal year ended June 27, 2015 totaled 51%, as compared with 47% in the fiscal year ended June 28, 2014 and 42% in the fiscal year ended June 29, 2013.\nWe do not have long-term sales agreements with any of our customers. Our customers are not subject to minimum purchase requirements, may reduce or delay orders periodically due to excess inventory and may discontinue purchasing our products at any time. Our distributors typically offer competing products in addition to ours. For the fiscal year ended June 27, 2015, sales to our domestic and international distributors were approximately 67% of net revenues, as compared with approximately 68% of net revenues in the fiscal year ended June 28, 2014 and approximately 66% in the fiscal year ended June 29, 2013. Distributors therefore continue to account for a significant portion of our sales. The loss of one or more significant customers, or the decision by a significant distributor to carry additional product lines of our competitors could decrease our revenues.\nSelling through distributor channels increases the complexity of our business, requiring us to, among other matters:\n\u2022\nmanage a more complex supply chain;\n\u2022\nmonitor and understand the drivers of inventory levels at each of our distributors;\n\u2022\nprovide for credits, return rights and price protection;\n\u2022\nestimate the impact of credits, return rights, price protection and unsold inventory at distributors; and\n\u2022\nmonitor the financial condition and creditworthiness of our distributors.\nIncreases in inventory could increase the complexity of one or more of the above factors. Any failure to manage these challenges, or the occurrence of an imbalance in supply and demand, could cause us or our distributors to inaccurately forecast sales and carry excess or insufficient inventory, thereby adversely affecting our net sales, operating results and cash flows. For further detail on credits, return rights and price protection, see Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition.\nBecause we sell products in foreign markets and have operations outside of the United States, we face foreign business, political, economic and currency risks that could seriously harm us. Almost all of our wafer suppliers and assembly subcontractors are located in Southeast Asia, as are our FCP manufacturing facilities, which exposes us to the problems associated with international operations.\nRisks associated with international business operations include the following:\n\u2022\ndisruptions or delays in shipments;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions in the countries where these subcontractors are located;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nchanges in political conditions;\n\u2022\npotentially reduced protection for intellectual property;\n\u2022\nforeign governmental regulatory requirements and unexpected changes in them;\n\u2022\nthe burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws;\n\u2022\nimport and export controls;\n\u2022\ndelays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for technology;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, tariffs and other barriers, and freight rates; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (\u201cU. S. GAAP\u201d).\nRegulatory, geopolitical and other factors could seriously harm our business or require us to modify our current business practices. We are subject to general geopolitical risks in connection with our international operations, such as political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships. Although most of our products are sold in U.S. dollars, we incur a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, capital equipment purchases and taxes in local currencies. The impact of currency exchange rate movements could harm our results and financial condition. In addition, changes in tariff and import regulations and in U.S. and non-U.S. monetary policies could harm our results and financial condition by increasing our expenses and reducing our revenue. Varying tax rates in different jurisdictions could harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our overall tax rate.\nIn the fiscal year ended June 27, 2015, we generated approximately 91%, 6% and 3% of our net revenues from sales in Asia, the United States and the rest of the world, respectively. In each of the fiscal years ended June 28, 2014 and June 29, 2013, we generated approximately 92%, 5% and 3% of our net revenues from sales in Asia, the United States and the rest of the world, respectively. We expect that foreign sales will continue to represent by far the majority of net revenues. This will require significant management attention and financial resources and further subject us to international operating risks.\nWe have subsidiaries located in Asia. We manufacture some of our FCPs in Taiwan as well as in the Jinan Development Zone in the Shandong Province of the PRC. The development of the Jinan facility depended upon various tax concessions, tax rebates and other support from the local governmental entity. There can be no assurance that the local governmental entity will not change their position regarding such tax and other support and such a change might adversely affect the profitability of this facility. In addition, there can be no assurance we will be able to assemble and maintain sufficient management resources in our Asia subsidiaries, including a sales force knowledgeable about our target markets and an accounting staff with sufficient U. S. GAAP accounting expertise.\nWe are expanding our presence in China with manufacturing and research and development activities. We will be subject to increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. The value of the Chinese yuan against the\nUnited States dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in China\u2019s political and economic conditions. Significant future appreciation of the yuan could increase our component and other raw material costs as well as our labor costs, and could adversely affect our financial results. Devaluation of the yuan could lower some of our costs and make our operations more competitive, but would also reduce the value of sales made in the currency. To the extent that we need to convert United States dollars into yuan for our operations, appreciation of yuan against the United States dollar could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, if we decide to convert our yuan into United States dollars for other business purposes and the United States dollar appreciates against the yuan, the United States dollar equivalent of the yuan we convert would be reduced. The Chinese government now measures the exchange rate of the yuan against a number of currencies, rather than just the United States dollar. Fluctuations in the yuan exchange rate could increase and could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nIn addition, there is a potential risk of conflict and further instability in the relationship between Taiwan and the PRC. Conflict or instability could disrupt the operations of one of our principal wafer suppliers, several of our assembly subcontractors located in Taiwan, and our FCP manufacturing operations in Taiwan and the PRC.\nOur operations and financial results could be severely harmed by natural disasters.\nOur headquarters and some of our major suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities are located near major earthquake faults. In particular, our Asian operations and most of our third party service providers involved in the manufacturing of our products are located within relative close proximity. Therefore, any disaster that strikes within or close to that geographic area could be extremely disruptive to our business and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOne of the foundries we use is located in Taiwan, which has suffered severe earthquakes in the past. Taiwan is also exposed to typhoons and tsunamis, which can affect not only foundries we rely upon but also our PSE-TW subsidiary. In March 2011, an earthquake and tsunami occurred off the northeast coast of Japan which disrupted the global supply chain for core materials manufactured in Japan that are incorporated in our products and manufacturing equipment. Thailand experienced floods in the quarter ended December 31, 2011, which interrupted the industry\u2019s supply chain for storage products and impacted our sales as well. If a major earthquake, typhoon, tsunami or other natural disaster were to affect our operations or those of our suppliers, our product supply could be interrupted, which would seriously harm our business. Natural disasters could also affect the operations of the distributors and contract manufacturers we sell to, as well as the operations of our end use customers, which would adversely affect our operations and financial results. Natural disasters anywhere in the world may potentially adversely affect us by harming or causing interruptions to our supply chain or the supply chains of our suppliers, direct customers or end use customers.\nSystem security risks, data protection or privacy breaches and cyber-attacks could disrupt our internal operations and harm the reputation of the Company.\nBreaches of our information technology systems caused by computer viruses, unauthorized access, sabotage, vandalism or terrorism could compromise our information technology networks and result in unauthorized release of our, our customers\u2019 or our suppliers\u2019 confidential or proprietary information, theft of our intellectual property, cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations, result in release of employee personal data, or cause us to incur increased information technology protection costs, any of which could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE SECURITIES MARKETS AND OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur stock has been and will likely continue to be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile. The securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in the past, and the market prices of the securities of semiconductor companies have been especially volatile. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, including the current global economic situation, could reduce the market price of\nour common stock in spite of our operating performance. Our stock price could fluctuate widely in response to factors some of which are not within our control, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the semiconductor and electronic systems industries;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by analysts; and\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, which have particularly affected the market prices of many high technology companies.", "PERMNO": 85496, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "PSEM"}
