The following sets forth factors related to our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance or cash flows which could cause an investment in our securities to decline and result in a loss.\nPrices for natural gas and natural gas liquids are volatile and can fluctuate widely based upon a number of factors beyond our control, including oversupply relative to the demand for our products, weather and the price and availability of alternative fuels. An extended decline in the prices we receive for our natural gas and natural gas liquids will adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur financial results are significantly affected by the prices we receive for our natural gas and natural gas liquids. Natural gas, natural gas liquids, oil and condensate prices are very volatile and can fluctuate widely based upon supply from energy producers relative to demand for these products and other factors beyond our control. The disposition in 2017 of our entire coal operations has increased our exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas, natural gas liquids, oil and condensate.\nIn particular, while demand for natural gas has recovered to pre-recession levels, the U.S. natural gas industry continues to face concerns of oversupply due to the success of Marcellus and other new shale plays. The oversupply of natural gas in 2012 resulted in domestic prices hovering around ten year lows, and drilling continued in these plays, despite these lower gas prices, to meet drilling commitments. Although gas prices recovered somewhat during 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, they again significantly declined in the latter part of 2014 and have remained at depressed levels since 2015.\nOur producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Appalachian Basin, which exacerbates the impact of regional supply and demand factors on our business, including the pricing of our gas. The success of the Marcellus Shale and Utica plays has resulted in growth in natural gas production in this region, with production per day in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio more than tripling since 2011. Not all of the natural gas produced in this region can be consumed by regional demand and must therefore be exported to other regions through pipelines. This export causes gas purchased and sold locally to be priced at a discount to many other market hubs, such as the benchmark Louisiana Henry Hub price. This discount, or negative basis, to the Henry Hub price is forecasted to continue in future years. While we expect many of the planned interstate pipeline projects to reduce this discount, it could widen further if these projects to move gas out of the basin are delayed for any reason, such as permitting issues or environmental lawsuits.\nAn extended period of lower natural gas prices can negatively affect us in several other ways. These include reduced cash flow, which decreases funds available for capital expenditures to replace reserves or increase production. For example, the low natural gas prices continuing from 2014 through 2015, resulted in our decreasing 2016 and 2017 capital expenditures and the drilling of new shale wells. Also, our access to other sources of capital, such as equity or long-term debt markets, could be severely limited or unavailable.\nOur drilling plans also include some activity in areas of shale formations that may also contain natural gas liquids, condensate and/or oil. The prices for natural gas liquids, condensate and oil are also volatile for reasons similar to those described above regarding natural gas. As a result of increasing supply, condensate and oil prices have exhibited great volatility. In addition, similar to the oversupply of natural gas, increased drilling activity by third-parties in formations containing natural gas liquids has led to a decline of over 30% since 2014 in the uplift we receive, on an Mcfe equivalent basis when excluding hedging impact, from natural gas liquids. Our results of operation may be adversely affected by a continued depressed level of, or further downward fluctuations in, natural gas liquids, condensate and oil prices.\nApart from issues with respect to the supply of products we produce, demand can fluctuate widely due to a number of matters beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nweather conditions in our markets which affect the demand for natural gas;\n\u2022\nchanges in the consumption pattern of industrial consumers, electricity generators and residential users of electricity and natural gas;\n\u2022\nwith respect to natural gas, the price and availability of alternative fuel sources used by electricity generators;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nthe costs, availability and capacity of transportation infrastructure;\n\u2022\nproximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of domestic and foreign governmental laws and regulations, including environmental and climate change regulations and delays in the receipt of, failure to receive, failure to maintain or revocation of necessary governmental permits.\nOur business depends on gathering, processing and transportation facilities and other midstream facilities owned by CNXM and others. The disruption of, capacity constraints in, or proximity to pipeline systems could limit sales of our natural gas and natural gas liquids, and any decrease in availability of third-party pipelines or other midstream facilities interconnected to third parties\u2019 or CNXM\u2019s gathering systems could adversely affect our operations or our investment in CNXM.\nWe gather, process and transport our natural gas to market by utilizing pipelines and facilities owned by others, including CNXM. If pipeline or facility capacity is limited, or if pipeline or facility capacity is unexpectedly disrupted for any reason, our natural gas sales and/or sales of natural gas liquids could be reduced, which could negatively affect our profitability. If we cannot access processing pipeline transportation facilities, we may have to reduce our production of natural gas. If our sales of natural gas or natural gas liquids are reduced because of transportation or processing constraints, our revenues will be reduced and our unit costs will also increase. If pipeline quality standards change, we might be required to install additional processing equipment which could increase our costs. The pipeline could also curtail our flows until the natural gas delivered to their pipeline is in compliance. Any reduction in our production of natural gas or increase in our costs could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, a significant portion of our natural gas is sold on or through a single pipeline, Texas Eastern Transmission, which could experience capacity issues, operational disruptions and unexpected downtime. Any reduction in capacity on the Texas Eastern pipeline could result in curtailments and reduce our production of natural gas. A reduction in capacity could also reduce the demand for our natural gas, which would reduce the price we receive for our production.\nAdditionally, we have various third-party firm transportation, natural gas processing, gathering and other agreements in place, many of which have minimum volume delivery commitments. We are obligated to pay fees on minimum volumes to our service providers regardless of actual volume throughput. Reductions in our drilling program may result in insufficient production to utilize our full firm transportation and processing capacity. If we have insufficient production to meet the minimum volumes, our cash flow from operations will be reduced, which may require us to reduce or delay our planned investments and capital expenditures or seek alternative means of financing, all of which may have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur investment in midstream infrastructure through CNXM is intended to connect our wells to other existing gathering and transmission pipelines. Our infrastructure development and maintenance programs, through CNXM, can involve significant risks, including those relating to timing, cost overruns and operational efficiency, which risks can be further affected by other issues. For example, approximately 41% of our 2017 production flowed through CNXM\u2019s Majorsville and McQuay Stations. An operational issue at either of those stations would materially impact CNX\u2019s production, cash flow and results of operation. CNXM\u2019s assets connect to other pipelines or facilities owned and operated by unaffiliated third parties. The continuing operation of third-party pipelines, processing and fractionation plants, compressor stations and other midstream facilities is not within our or CNXM\u2019s control. These third-party pipelines, processing and fractionation plants, compressor stations and other midstream facilities may become unavailable because of testing, turnarounds, line repair, maintenance, changes to operating conditions, delivery or receipt parameters, unavailability of firm transportation, lack of operating capacity, force majeure events, regulatory requirements and curtailments of receipt or deliveries due to insufficient capacity or because of damage from severe weather conditions or other operational issues.\nWe face uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable natural gas reserves, and inaccuracies in our estimates could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs and decreased profitability.\nNatural gas reserves are economically recoverable when the price at which they are expected to be sold exceeds their expected cost of production and sales. Natural gas reserves require subjective estimates of underground accumulations of natural gas assumptions concerning natural gas prices, production levels, reserve estimates and operating and development costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved natural gas reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect. For example, a significant amount of our proved undeveloped reserves extensions and discoveries during the last three years were due to the addition of wells on our Marcellus Shale acreage more than one offset location away from existing production with reliable technology, which may be more susceptible to positive and negative changes in reserve estimates than our proved developed reserves. Over time, material changes to reserve estimates may be made, taking into account the results of actual drilling, testing and production. Also, we make certain assumptions regarding natural gas prices, production\nlevels, and operating and development costs that may prove incorrect. Any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of our natural gas reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of natural gas reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows. Numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based, as described above, often result in the actual quantities of natural gas we ultimately recover being different from reserve estimates. The present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas reserves. We base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved natural gas reserves on historical average prices and costs. However, actual future net cash flows from our natural gas properties also will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\ngeological conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations and taxation;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of actual production;\n\u2022\nfuture prices and our hedging position;\n\u2022\nfuture operating costs; and\n\u2022\ncapital costs of drilling, completion and gathering assets.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general. If natural gas prices decline by $0.10 per Mcf, then the pre-tax present value using a 10% discount rate of our proved natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2017 would decrease from $4.1 billion to $3.9 billion.\nEach of the factors which impacts reserve estimation may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating the reserves. For these reasons, estimates of natural gas reserves may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our natural gas reserves will likely vary from estimates, and these variances may be material. As a result, our estimates may not accurately reflect our actual natural gas reserves.\nDrilling natural gas wells is a high-risk activity.\nOur growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program. Drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks, including the risk that an encountered well does not produce in sufficient quantities to make the well economically viable. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including those discussed in \u201cOur operations are subject to operating risks...\u201d set forth below.\nOur future drilling activities may not be successful, and if they are unsuccessful, such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. Our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate within a particular geographic area may decline. We may be unable to drill identified or budgeted wells within our expected time frame, or at all. We may be unable to drill a particular well because, in some cases, we identify a drilling location before we have leased all of the interests required to drill the well in that location. Similarly, our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget. The final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe results of delineation efforts and the acquisition, review and analysis of seismic data;\n\u2022\nthe availability of sufficient capital resources to us and any other participants in a well for the drilling of the well;\n\u2022\nwhether we are able to acquire on a timely basis all of the leasehold interests and obtain all of the permits required to drill the wells;\n\u2022\neconomic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas and oil and the availability of drilling rigs and crews; and\nour financial resources and results.\nOur business strategy focuses on horizontal drilling and production in the Marcellus and Utica Shale plays in the Appalachian Basin. Drilling horizontal wells is technologically difficult and involves risks relating to our ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages and to successfully run casing the length of the well bore and involves a higher risk of failure. Additionally, drilling a horizontal well involves higher costs, which results in the risks of our drilling program being spread over a smaller number of wells, and that, in order to be economic, each horizontal well will need to produce at a higher level in order\nto cover the higher drilling costs. Similarly, the average lateral length of the horizontal wells we drill has generally been increasing. Longer-lateral wells are typically more expensive and require more time for preparation and permitting. In addition, we use multi-well pads instead of single-well sites. The use of multi-well pad drilling increases some operational risks because problems affecting the pad or a single well could adversely affect production from all of the wells on the pad. Pad drilling can also make our overall production, and therefore our revenue and cash flows, more volatile, because production from multiple wells on a pad will typically commence simultaneously. While we believe that we will be better served by drilling horizontal wells using multi-well pads, the risk component involved in such drilling will be increased in some respects, with the result that we might find it more difficult to achieve economic success in our drilling program.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled out over multiple years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nOur management team has specifically identified and scheduled certain drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including natural gas and oil prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, the acquisition on acceptable terms of any leasehold interests we do not control necessary to complete the drilling unit, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, transportation constraints, regulatory and zoning approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertain factors, we do not know if the numerous drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled. We will require significant additional capital over a prolonged period in order to pursue the development of these locations, and we may not be able to raise or generate the capital required to do so. Any drilling activities we are able to conduct on these locations may not be successful or result in our ability to add additional proved reserves or may result in a downward revision of our estimated proved reserves, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRegulation of greenhouse gas emissions may increase our operating costs and reduce the value of our natural gas assets and such regulation, as well as uncertainty concerning such regulation, could adversely impact the market for natural gas, as well as for our securities.\nWhile climate change legislation in the U.S. is unlikely in the next several years, the issue of global climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention with underlying concern about the impacts of human activity, especially the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide and methane.\nThe EPA, under the Climate Action Plan, has elected to regulate GHGs under the Clean Air Act (CAA) to limit emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from natural gas-fired power plants. On September 20, 2013, the EPA re-proposed New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for CO2 from new power plants and on June 2, 2014, the EPA re-proposed NSPS for CO2 from existing and modified/reconstructed power plants, which rescinded the rules that were originally proposed in 2012. On August 3, 2015, the EPA finalized the Carbon Pollution Standards to cut carbon emissions from new, modified and reconstructed power plants, which became effective on October 23, 2015. In another proposed rulemaking related to CO2 emissions, on June 2, 2014, the EPA proposed the Clean Power Plan Rule to cut carbon emissions from existing power plants. Under this proposed rule, the EPA would create emission guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. Specifically, the EPA is proposing state-specific rate-based goals for CO2 emissions from the power sector, as well as guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to achieve the state-specific goals. On August 3, 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan Rule to cut carbon pollution from existing power plants, which became effective on December 22, 2015. Numerous petitions challenging the Clean Power Plan Rule have been consolidated into one case, West Virginia v. EPA. While the litigation is still ongoing at the circuit court level, a mid-litigation application to the Supreme Court resulted in a stay of the Clean Power Plan Rule. On September 27, 2016, an en banc panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit heard oral arguments in the case. In April 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA\u2019s motion to hold the case in abeyance while the EPA undertakes its review of the regulations.\nThe EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, construction and Title V operating permits for large stationary sources. Facilities requiring PSD permits may also be required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d (BACT) standards. Rulemaking related to GHG could alter or delay our ability to obtain new and/or modified source permits.\nAs part of the Obama administration\u2019s initiative to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural gas industry, the EPA adopted rules to control volatile organic compound emissions from certain oil and gas equipment and operations. In June 2017, the EPA issued a 90-day stay of certain requirements under the methane rule. The stay was vacated in July 2017 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In the interim, in July 2017 the EPA issued a proposed rule that would stay the methane rule for two years, but this rule is not yet final, is subject to public notice and comment and may be subject to legal challenges.\nAdditionally, applicability of CNX and CNXM facilities under the CAA, as well as state sponsored permitting programs are subject to regulatory uncertainty and therefore present risk, including hitting production objectives, and cost for controls and compliance. Some states in which we operate are contemplating measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and potential cap-and-trade programs. Most of these types programs require major source of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available being reduced each year until a target goal is achieved. The cost of these allowances could increase over time. While new laws and regulations that are aimed at reducing GHG emissions will increase demand for natural gas, they may also result in increased costs for permitting, equipping, monitoring and reporting GHGs.\nEnvironmental regulations introduce uncertainty that could adversely impact the market for natural gas with potential short and long-term liabilities.\nWe and CNXM are subject to various stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and costly response actions. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our, CNXM\u2019s and our respective customers' operations. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permits may result in joint and several or strict liability or the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, and/or the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations. Private parties, including the owners of the properties through which CNXM\u2019s gathering systems pass, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance, as well as to seek damages for non-compliance, with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. We may not be able to recover all or any of these costs from insurance. There is no assurance that changes in or additions to public policy regarding the protection of the environment will not have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.\nOur operations, and those of CNXM, also pose risks of environmental liability due to leakage, migration, releases or spills from our operations to surface or subsurface soils, surface water or groundwater. Certain environmental laws impose strict as well as joint and several liability for costs required to investigate, remediate, and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been stored or released. We may also be subject to fines and penalties for such releases. We may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations.\nThe Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) and similar state laws protect species endangered or threatened with extinction. Protection of endangered and threatened species may cause us to modify gas well pad siting or pipeline right of ways, or develop and implement species-specific protection and enhancement plans to avoid or minimize impacts to endangered species or their habitats. Further consideration for listing species within our operating region is expected, and CNX considers this uncertainty, as well as the cost to comply with stringent mitigation requirements a risk to cost and operational timing.\nCNX utilizes pipelines extensively for its natural gas and water businesses. Stream encroachment and crossing permits from the Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) are often required for certain impacts these pipelines cause to streams and wetlands. On April 21, 2014 the EPA published a proposed rule called \u201cDefinition of \u2018Waters of the United States\u2019 (WoUS) Under the Clean Water Act.\u201d The proposal would expand the scope of the CWA to include previously non-jurisdictional streams, wetlands, and waters, making these areas jurisdictional inter-coastal waters of the U.S. In February 2015 the EPA and ACOE issued a memorandum of understanding to withdraw the WoUS Interpretive Rule. The EPA published the latest version of the WoUS rule (the Clean Water Rule) on June 29, 2015, which was to become effective on August 28, 2015. However, on August 27, 2015, the District Court of North Dakota blocked implementation of the rule in 13 states. On October 9, 2015, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit blocked implementation of the rule nationwide. The Trump administration has proposed replacing the October 2015 definition with the prior definition. Additionally, in January 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to decide whether the federal court of appeals or federal district courts have jurisdiction. Oral argument was heard in October 2017, and a decision is expected in calendar year 2018. If the EPA moves forward with implementation of the 2015 rule, or if states make any similar changes to their regulatory programs, this could lead to additional mitigation costs for us and CNXM, and severely limit our and CNXM\u2019s operations.\nOther regulations applicable to the natural gas industry are under constant review for amendment or expansion at both the federal and state levels. Any future changes may increase the costs of producing natural gas and other hydrocarbons, which would adversely impact our cash flows and results of operations. For example, hydraulic fracturing is an important and common\npractice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight unconventional shale formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and gas agencies. The disposal of produced water and other wastes in underground injection disposal wells is regulated by the EPA under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act or by various states in which we conduct operations under counterpart state laws and regulations. The imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct hydraulic fracturing operations or to dispose of waste resulting from such operations.\nOur operations are subject to operating risks, including our reliance upon third-party contractors, which could increase our operating expenses and decrease our production levels which could adversely affect our results of operations. Our operations are also subject to hazards and any losses or liabilities we suffer from hazards, which occur in our operations may not be fully covered by our insurance policies.\nOur exploration for and production of natural gas and CNXM\u2019s gathering, compression and transportation operations involve numerous operating risks. The cost of drilling, completing and operating our shale gas wells, shallow oil and gas wells and coalbed methane (CBM) wells is often uncertain, and a number of factors can delay or prevent drilling operations, decrease production and/or increase the cost of our natural gas operations at particular sites for varying lengths of time thereby adversely affecting our operating results. The operating risks that may have a significant impact on our natural gas operations include:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in geologic formations;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or repairs;\n\u2022\nfires, ruptures, landslides, mine subsidence, explosions or other accidents;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nreductions in natural gas prices;\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches or terroristic acts;\n\u2022\ndamage to pipelines, compressor stations, pump stations, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by design, installation, construction materials or operational flaws, natural disasters, acts of terrorism and acts of third parties;\n\u2022\nlack of adequate capacity for treatment or disposal of waste water generated in drilling, completion and production operations;\n\u2022\nenvironmental conditions, including contamination from surface spillage of fluids used in well drilling, completion or operation including fracturing fluids used in hydraulic fracturing of wells, leaks of natural gas or condensate or losses of natural gas or condensate as a result of the malfunction of, or other disruptions associated with, equipment or facilities or other contamination of groundwater or the environment resulting from our use of such fluids;\n\u2022\ndelays in the issuance of permits at the state or local level and the resolution of regulatory concerns; and\n\u2022\nlack of availability or high cost of drilling rigs, other field services, personnel and equipment.\nThe realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations, materially increase our costs, or result in substantial loss to us as a result of claims for:\n\u2022\npersonal injury or loss of life;\n\u2022\ndamage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, including our properties and our natural gas production or transportation facilities;\n\u2022\npollution and other environmental damage to our properties or the properties of others;\n\u2022\npotential legal liability and monetary losses;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation within the industry or with customers;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspension of our operations; and\n\u2022\nrepair and remediation costs.\nThe occurrence of any of these events in our gas operations which prevents delivery of natural gas to a customer and which is not excusable as a force majeure event under our supply agreement, could result in economic penalties, suspension or cancellation of shipments or ultimately termination of the supply agreement.\nAlthough we and CNXM maintain insurance for a number of risks and hazards, we may not be insured or fully insured against the losses or liabilities that could arise from a significant accident in our operations. We may elect not to obtain insurance\nfor any or all of these risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe attempt to mitigate the risks involved with increased natural gas production activity by entering into \u201ctake or pay\u201d contracts with well service providers which commit them to provide field services to us at specified levels and commit us to pay for field services at specified levels even if we do not use those services. However, these types of contracts expose us to economic risk during a downturn in demand or during periods of oversupply. For example, in 2017 due to the oversupply of gas in our markets, we made payments under these types of contracts of approximately $40 million for field services that we did not use. Having to pay for services we do not use decreases our cash flow and increases our costs.\nWe may not be able to obtain required personnel, services, equipment, parts and raw materials in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities or at reasonable costs to support our operations.\nWe rely on a supply of third-party contractors to provide key services and equipment for our operations. We contract with third parties for well services, related equipment, and qualified experienced field personnel to drill wells, construct pipelines and conduct field operations. We also utilize third-party contractors to provide land acquisition and related services to support our land operational needs. The demand for these services, this equipment and for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells, construct pipelines and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices, causing periodic shortages. Weather may also play a role with respect to the relative availability of certain materials. Historically, there have been shortages of drilling and workover rigs, pipe, compressors and other equipment as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. The costs and delivery times of equipment and supplies are substantially greater in periods of peak demand, including increased demand for plays outside of our area of geographic focus. Accordingly, we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain necessary services, drilling equipment and supplies in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms, and we may experience shortages of, or increases in the costs of, drilling equipment, crews and associated supplies, equipment and field services in the future.\nAny of the above shortages may lead to escalating prices for drilling equipment, land services, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. Shortages may lead to poor service and inefficient drilling operations and increase the possibility of accidents due to the hiring of inexperienced personnel and overuse of equipment by contractors. Additionally, a decrease in the availability of these services, equipment and personnel could lead to a decrease in our natural gas production, increase our costs of natural gas production, and decrease our anticipated profitability. Such shortages could delay or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which events could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIf natural gas prices remain depressed or drilling efforts are unsuccessful, we may be required to record writedowns of our proved natural gas properties.\nLower natural gas prices or wells that produce less than expected quantities of natural gas may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically. This may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. If this occurs, or if our estimates of development costs increase, production data factors change or our exploration results deteriorate, accounting rules may require us to write down, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our natural gas properties. We are required to perform impairment tests on our assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or whenever management's plans change with respect to those assets. For example, in the second quarter of 2015, we had an impairment charge of approximately $829 million for certain of our natural gas assets, primarily shallow oil and gas assets. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken.\nCompetition within the natural gas industry may adversely affect our ability to sell our products and midstream services. Increased competition or a loss of our competitive position could adversely affect our sales of, or our prices for, our products, which could impair our profitability.\nThe natural gas and midstream industries are intensely competitive with companies from various regions of the United States. Many of the companies with which we and CNXM compete are larger and have greater financial, technological, human and other resources. If we are unable to compete, our company, our operating results and financial position may be adversely affected. In addition, larger companies may be able to pay more to acquire new natural gas properties for future exploration, limiting our ability to replace the natural gas we produce or to grow our production. The highly competitive environment in which\nwe operate may negatively impact our ability to acquire additional properties at prices or upon terms we view as favorable. The competitive environment can also make it more challenging to discover new natural gas resources, evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate these transactions. Any reduction in our ability to compete in current or future natural gas markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, CNXM\u2019s ability to increase throughput on its midstream systems and any related revenue from third-parties is subject to capacity availability on their existing systems, its ability to expand its existing systems, contractual limitations to its existing customers and competition from third parties, primarily operators of other natural gas gathering systems. The fact that a substantial majority of the capacity of CNXM\u2019s midstream systems will be necessary to service the production of CNX and one third-party customer and we and that third-party will receive priority of service for the provision of CNXM midstream services over other third-parties, may result in CNXM not having the capacity to provide services to other third-party customers. In addition, potential third-party customers who are significant producers of natural gas and condensate may develop their own midstream systems in lieu of using CNXM\u2019s systems. All of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on CNXM\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and ability to make cash distributions and therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our investment in CNXM.\nDeterioration in the economic conditions in any of the industries in which our customers operate, a domestic or worldwide financial downturn, or negative credit market conditions may have a materially adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations, business and financial condition that we cannot predict.\nEconomic conditions in a number of industries in which our customers operate, such as electric power generation, have experienced substantial deterioration in and the past, resulting in reduced demand for natural gas. In addition, liquidity is essential to our business and developing our assets. Renewed or continued weakness in the economic conditions of any of the industries we serve or that are served by our customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and liquidity in a number of ways. For example:\n\u2022\ndemand for natural gas and electricity in the United States is impacted by industrial production, which if weakened would negatively impact the revenues, margins and profitability of our natural gas business;\n\u2022\nthe tightening of credit or lack of credit availability to our customers could adversely affect our ability to collect our trade receivables;\n\u2022\nour ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital for our business including for exploration and/or development of our natural gas reserves; and\n\u2022\na decline in our creditworthiness may require us to post letters of credit, cash collateral, or surety bonds to secure certain obligations, all of which would have an adverse effect on our liquidity.\nOur hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks.\nTo manage our exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas, we enter into hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. As of January 15, 2018, we expect these transactions will represent approximately 388.6 Bcf of our estimated 2018 production at an average price of $2.77 per Mcf, 273.0 Bcf of our estimated 2019 production at an average price of $2.74 per Mcf, 198.3 Bcf of our estimated 2020 production at an average price of $2.78 per Mcf, approximately 166.5 Bcf of our estimated 2021 production at an average price of $2.62 per Mcf, and approximately 153.4 Bcf of our estimated 2022 production at an average price of $2.83 per Mcf. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities, we may be prevented from realizing the near-term benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges. If we choose not to engage in, or reduce our use of hedging arrangements in the future, we may be more adversely affected by changes in natural gas prices than our competitors who engage in hedging arrangements to a greater extent than we do.\nIn addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u2022\nour production is less than expected;\n\u2022\nthe counterparties to our contracts fail to perform the contracts;\n\u2022\nthe creditworthiness of our counterparties or their guarantors is substantially impaired; and\n\u2022\ncounterparties have credit limits that may constrain our ability to hedge additional volumes.\nOur ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness declines or if they fail to honor their contracts with us.\nOur ability to receive payment for natural gas sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness of our customers. Many utilities have sold their power plants to non-regulated affiliates or third-parties that may be less creditworthy,\nthereby increasing the risk we bear with respect to potential payment default. These new power plant owners may have credit ratings that are below investment grade. If the creditworthiness of our customers or their ability to pay declines significantly, our business could be adversely affected. Our inability to collect payment from counterparties to our sales contracts may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nExisting and future government laws, regulations and other legal requirements that govern our business may increase our costs of doing business and may restrict our operations.\nThere are numerous governmental regulations applicable to the natural gas industry that are not directly related to environmental regulation, many of which are under constant review for amendment or expansion at the federal and state level. Any future changes may affect, among other things, the pricing or marketing of natural gas production.\nCurrently, CNXM\u2019s gathering operations are exempt from regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under the Natural Gas Act (NGA). Although FERC has not made any formal determinations with respect to any of CNXM\u2019s facilities considered to be gathering facilities, CNXM believes that the natural gas pipelines in its gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish that a natural gas pipeline is a gathering pipeline not subject to FERC jurisdiction. However, this this issue has been the subject of substantial litigation, and if FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility or services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would become subject to regulation by FERC. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect results of operations and cash flows for CNXM.\nAdditionally, some states have begun to adopt more stringent regulation and oversight of natural gas gathering lines than is currently required by federal standards. Pennsylvania, under Act 127, authorized the Public Utility Commission (PUC) oversight of Class I gathering lines, as well as requiring standards and fees associated with Class II and Class III pipelines. The state of Ohio also moved to regulate natural gas gathering lines in a similar manner pursuant to Ohio Senate Bill 315 (SB315). SB315 expanded the Ohio PUC's authority over rural natural gas gathering lines. These changes in interpretation and regulation affect our midstream activities, requiring changes in reporting, as well as increased costs.\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of pipeline and related facility integrity management program testing and any related pipeline repair or preventative or remedial measures.\nPHMSA has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transportation pipelines and related facilities located where a leak or rupture could do the most harm, i.e., in \u201chigh consequence areas.\u201d The regulations require operators to:\n\u2022\nperform ongoing assessments of pipeline and related facility integrity;\n\u2022\nidentify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area;\n\u2022\nimprove data collection, integration and analysis;\n\u2022\nrepair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and\n\u2022\nimplement preventive and mitigating actions.\nThe 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, among other things, increased the maximum civil penalty for pipeline safety violations and directed the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate rules or standards relating to expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve use, excess flow valve use, leak detection system installation, and testing to confirm the material strength of pipe operating above 30% of specified minimum yield strength in high consequence areas. In 2017, PHMSA adopted new rules increasing the maximum administrative civil penalties for violation of the pipeline safety laws and regulations to $209,002 per violation per day, with a maximum of $2,909,022 for a related series of violations. Should our or CNXM's operations fail to comply with PHMSA or comparable state regulations, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. PHMSA has also published notices and advanced notices of proposed rulemaking to solicit comments on the need for changes to its safety regulations, including whether to extend the integrity management program requirements to additional types of facilities, such as gathering pipelines and related facilities. In January 2017, in the final week of the Obama Administration, PHMSA released a pre-publication copy of its final hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations that would significantly extend the integrity management requirements to previously exempt pipelines and would impose additional obligations on hazardous liquid pipeline operators that are already subject to the integrity management requirements, including periodic integrity assessments and leak detection for pipelines outside of high consequence areas, inspections of pipelines after extreme weather events, expanded reporting, and more stringent integrity management repair and data collection requirements. Due to the change in Presidential administrations, PHMSA\u2019s final hazardous liquid pipeline safety rule was never published in the Federal Register and has not yet taken effect. PHMSA is expected to finalize its hazardous liquid pipeline safety rule this year. PHMSA\u2019s proposed rule would\nalso require annual reporting of safety-related conditions and incident reports for all hazardous liquid gathering lines and gravity lines, including pipelines that are currently exempt from PHMSA regulations. PHMSA issued a separate regulatory proposal in July 2015 that would impose pipeline incident prevention and response measures on natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline operators. Additionally, in April 2016, PHMSA published in the Federal Register a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (\u201cNPRM\u201d) that would significantly modify existing regulations related to reporting, impact, design, construction, maintenance, operations and integrity management of gas transmission and gathering pipelines. The proposed rule addresses four congressional mandates and six recommendations by the National Transportation Safety Board to broaden the scope of safety coverage by adding new assessment and repair criteria for gas transmission pipelines, and by expanding these protocols to include pipelines not formerly regulated by the federal standards. This includes extending regulatory requirements to transmission and gathering pipelines of eight inches and greater in rural Class I areas. Compliance with the rule, as proposed, may prove challenging and costly for operators of older pipelines due to the difficulty of locating historic records. As proposed, compliance with the rule could have a material adverse effect on our or CNXM's operations. However, the ultimate impact of the rule on the us and CNXM remains uncertain until the rulemaking is finalized. PHMSA is expected to finalize its natural gas pipeline safety rule this year. The adoption of regulations that apply more comprehensive or stringent safety standards could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue new capital projects, or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, all of which could require us to incur increased operational costs that could be significant. While we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives, such legislative and regulatory changes could have a material effect on our cash flow.\nOur shale gas drilling and production operations require both adequate sources of water to use in the fracturing process, as well as the ability to dispose of or recycle the water after hydraulic fracturing. Our CBM gas drilling and production operations also require the removal and disposal of water from the coal seams from which we produce gas. If we cannot find adequate sources of water for our use or we are unable to dispose of or recycle the water at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules, our ability to produce natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired.\nAs part of our drilling and production in shale formations, we use hydraulic fracturing processes. These processes require access to adequate sources of water, which may not be available in proximity to our operations or at certain times of the year. To ensure that we have adequate water available for our operations, we may be required to invest substantial amounts of capital in water pipelines which are used for relatively short periods of time. Alternatively, we may be required to truck water, and we may not be able to contract for sufficient water hauling trucks to meet our needs.\nFurther, we must remove the portion of the water that flows back to the well bore, as well as drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas. This water can be either disposed of or recycled for use in other hydraulic fracturing operations. In the event we are forced to dispose of water rather than recycle water, our costs may increase. In addition, in our CBM drilling and production, coal seams frequently contain water that must be removed and disposed of in order for the natural gas to detach from the coal and flow to the well bore.\nOur inability to obtain sufficient amounts of water with respect to our shale operations, or the inability to dispose of or recycle water and other wastes used in our shale and our CBM operations, could increase our costs and delay our operations, which will adversely impact our cash flow and results of operations.\nCNX and its subsidiaries are subject to various legal proceedings, which may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are party to a number of legal proceedings in the normal course of business activities. Defending these actions, especially purported class actions, can be costly, and can distract management. For example, we are a defendant in three pending purported class action lawsuits dealing with claimants\u2019 alleged entitlements to, and accounting for, natural gas royalties. There is also the possibility that we may become involved in future suits, including, for example, those being brought by coastal communities against oil, coal and other fossil fuel producers relating to climate change, which are beginning to gain prevalence in the courts. There is the potential that the costs of defending litigation in an individual matter or the aggregation of many matters could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations or financial position. See Note 18- Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of pending legal proceedings.\nWe do not control the timing of divestitures that we plan to engage in and they may not provide anticipated benefits. Additionally, we may be unable to acquire additional properties in the future and any acquired properties may not provide the anticipated benefits.\nOur business and financing plans include divesting certain assets over time. However, we do not control the timing of divestitures and delays in completing divestitures may reduce the benefits we may receive from them, such as elimination of management distraction by selling non-core assets and the receipt of cash proceeds that contribute to our liquidity. Additionally, if assets are held jointly with another party, we may not be permitted to dispose of these assets without the consent of our joint\nventure partner. Also, there can be no assurance that the assets we divest will produce anticipated proceeds. In addition, the terms of divestitures may cause a substantial portion of the benefits we anticipate receiving from them to be subject to future matters that we do not control.\nIn the future we may make acquisitions of assets or businesses that complement or expand our current business. No assurance can be given that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire the identified targets. The success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to effectively integrate the acquired business into our existing operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses or assets may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. Our failure to make acquisitions in the future and successfully integrate the acquired businesses or assets into our existing operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations\nThe provisions of our debt agreements and those of CNXM, and the risks associated therewith could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our total long-term indebtedness was approximately $ 2.22 billion of which approximately $1.71 billion was under our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2022 plus $4 million of unamortized bond premium, $500 million was under our 8.000% senior unsecured notes due 2023 less $5 million of unamortized bond discount, and $20 million of capitalized leases due through 2021. The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our outstanding debt, which will limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development of our gas and coal reserves or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the coal and natural gas industries;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with lower leverage and better access to capital resources; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to implement our business strategy.\nOur senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our 5.875% and 8.000% senior unsecured notes limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness unless specified tests or exceptions are met. In addition, our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing our 5.875% and 8.000% senior unsecured notes subject us to financial and/or other restrictive covenants. Under our senior secured credit agreement, we must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis including a minimum interest coverage ratio, and a minimum current ratio, as defined therein. Our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing our 5.875% and 8.000% senior unsecured notes impose a number of restrictions upon us, such as restrictions on granting liens on our assets, making investments, paying dividends, stock repurchases, selling assets and engaging in acquisitions. Failure by us to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us. Further, CNXM\u2019s existing $250.0 million revolving credit facility subjects it to certain financial and/or other restrictive covenants and other restrictions similar to those in our senior secured credit agreement and indentures.\nIf our or CNXM\u2019s cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our respective debt service obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing our 5.875% and 8.000% senior unsecured notes restrict our ability to sell assets and use the proceeds from the sales. We may not be able to consummate those sales or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nFailure to find or acquire economically recoverable natural gas reserves to replace our current natural gas reserves will cause our natural gas reserves and production to decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nProducing natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Because total estimated proved reserves include our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2017, production is expected to decline even if those proved undeveloped reserves are developed and the wells produce as expected. The rate of decline will change if production from our existing wells declines in a different manner than we have estimated and can change under other circumstances. Thus, our future natural gas reserves and production and, therefore,\nour cash flow and income are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional economically recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional economically recoverable reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs.\nIn addition, the level of natural gas and condensate volumes handled through the CNXM midstream systems depends on the level of production from natural gas wells dedicated to such midstream systems, which may be less than expected and which will naturally decline over time. In order to maintain or increase throughput levels on CNXM\u2019s midstream systems, CNXM must obtain production from new wells completed by us and any third-party customers on acreage dedicated to the CNXM midstream systems or execute agreements with other third parties in CNXM\u2019s areas of operation. CNXM has no control over producers\u2019 levels of development and completion activity in its areas of operations, the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to CNXM\u2019s systems or the rate at which production from a well declines.\nOur lenders use the loan value of our proved natural gas reserves to determine the borrowing base under our $1.5 billion senior secured credit facility. Our borrowing base could decrease for a variety of reasons including lower natural gas prices, declines in natural gas proved reserves, and lending requirements or regulations. Significant reductions in our borrowing base below $1.5 billion could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur ability to borrow and have letters of credit issued under our $1.5 billion senior secured credit facility is generally limited to a borrowing base. Our borrowing base is determined by the required number of lenders in good faith calculating a loan value of the Company\u2019s proved natural gas reserves. The borrowing base under our senior secured credit facility is currently $2.0 billion. Our borrowing base is redetermined by the lenders twice per year, and the next scheduled borrowing base redetermination is expected to occur in May 2018. The various matters which we describe in other risk factors that can decrease our proved natural gas reserves including lower natural gas prices, operating difficulties, and failure to replace our proved reserves could decrease our borrowing base. Please read: \u201cRisk Factors - We face uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable natural gas and coal reserves, and inaccuracies in our estimates could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs and decreased profitability\u201d and - \u201cUnless we replace our natural gas reserves, our natural gas reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\u201d Our borrowing base could also decrease as a result of new lending requirements or regulations or the issuance of new indebtedness. If our borrowing base declined significantly below $1.5 billion, we may be unable to implement our drilling and development plans, make acquisitions or otherwise carry out our business plan which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We also could be required to repay any outstanding indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base. We could face substantial liquidity problems, might not be able to access the equity or debt capital markets and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those sales or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and those proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nWe may operate a portion of our business with one or more joint venture partners or in circumstances where we are not the operator, which may restrict our operational and corporate flexibility; actions taken by the other partner or third-party operator may materially impact our financial position and results of operations; and we may not realize the benefits we expect to realize from a joint venture.\nAs is common in the industry we may operate one or more of our properties with a joint venture partner, or contract with a third-party to control operations. These relationships could require us to share operational and other control, such that we may no longer have the flexibility to control completely the development of these properties. If we do not timely meet our financial commitments in such circumstances, our rights to participate may be adversely affected. If a joint venture partner is unable or fails to pay its portion of development costs or if a third-party operator does not operate in accordance with our expectations, our costs of operations could be increased. We could also incur liability as a result of actions taken by a joint venture partner or third-party operator. Disputes between us and the other party may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses, delay or terminate projects and distract our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business.\nChanges in federal or state income tax laws, particularly in the area of intangible drilling costs, could cause our financial position and profitability to deteriorate.\nThe passage of legislation or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to natural gas exploration and development. Any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. For instance, recent tax law changes effective as of the beginning of 2018 will limit the ability of corporations to take certain interest deductions and have eliminated a corporation\u2019s ability to take deductions for income attributable to domestic production activities.\nAdditionally, legislation has been proposed from time to time in the states in which we operate - primarily Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia - that would impose severance taxes or increased severance taxes on the production from our wells. The proposed tax rates have varied but would represent a greater financial burden on the economics of the wells we drill in these states.\nStrategic determinations, including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities, are challenging, and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for investing our capital resources to produce superior rates of return. In developing our business plan, we consider allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including well development (primarily drilling), reserve acquisitions, exploratory activity, corporate items and other alternatives. We also consider our likely sources of capital, including cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our business plan, business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention, including possible acquisitions and dispositions. If we fail to identify optimal business strategies, or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies, our financial condition and future growth may be adversely affected. Moreover, economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our business plan, and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives.\nOur development and exploration projects, as well as CNXM\u2019s midstream system development, require substantial capital expenditures and if we fail to generate sufficient cash flow, or obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms, our natural gas reserves may decline and financial results may suffer.\nAs part of our strategic determinations, we expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in the development and acquisition of natural gas reserves. Further, CNXM will need to make substantial capital expenditures to fund its share of growth capital expenditures associated with its Anchor Systems, as well as to fund its share of expenditures associated with its 5% controlling interests in each of the Growth Systems and Additional Systems or to purchase or construct new midstream systems. If CNXM is unable to make sufficient or effective capital expenditures, it will be unable to maintain and grow its business.\nCNXM's gathering agreement with us, CNXM's largest customer, as amended, includes minimum well commitments; however, that gas gathering agreement and the gas gathering agreements with third-parties impose obligations on CNXM to invest capital which is not fully protected against volumetric risks associated with lower-than-forecast volumes flowing through its gathering systems. To the extent CNXM\u2019s customers are not contractually obligated to develop their properties in the areas covered by CNXM\u2019s acreage dedications, and determine that it is more attractive to direct their capital spending and resources to other areas, such decreases in development of reserves by CNXM customers could result in reduced volumes serviced by CNXM and a commensurate decline in revenues and cash flows.\nWe cannot assure you that we or CNXM will have sufficient cash from operations, borrowing capacity under each company\u2019s respective credit facilities or the ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets to meet our capital requirements. If cash flow generated by our operations or available borrowings under either company\u2019s credit facilities are not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, or we are unable to obtain additional financing, we could be required to curtail the pace of the development of our natural gas properties and midstream activities, which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks or cyber-attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks or cyber-attacks may significantly affect the energy industry, and economic conditions, including our operations and our customers, as well as general economic conditions, consumer confidence and spending and market liquidity. Strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future attacks than other targets in the United States. A cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss. Our insurance may not protect us against such occurrences. Consequently, it is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, to operate our businesses, process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees and business partners, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of natural gas reserves, and perform other activities related to our businesses. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. A cyber-attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption, or result in denial-of-service on websites. SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) based systems are potentially vulnerable to targeted cyber-attacks due to their critical role in operations.\nOur technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period.\nDeliberate attacks on our assets, or security breaches in our systems or infrastructure, the systems or infrastructure of third-parties or the cloud could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data, delays in production or delivery, difficulty in completing and settling transactions, challenges in maintaining our books and records, environmental damage, communication interruptions, other operational disruptions and third-party liability, including the following:\n\u2022\na cyber-attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt development of additional infrastructure, effectively delaying the start of cash flows from the project;\n\u2022\na cyber-attack on our facilities may result in equipment damage or failure;\n\u2022\na cyber-attack on midstream or downstream pipelines could prevent our product from being delivered, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u2022\na cyber-attack on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption resulting in loss of revenues;\n\u2022\na deliberate corruption of our financial or operational data could result in events of non-compliance which could lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions could result in expensive remediation efforts, distraction of management, damage to our reputation, or a negative impact on the price of our units.\nOur implementation of various controls and processes, including globally incorporating a risk-based cyber security framework, to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure is costly and labor intensive. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nConstruction of new gathering, compression, dehydration, treating or other midstream assets by CNXM may not result in revenue increases and may be subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks, which could adversely affect CNXM\u2018s cash flows, results of operations and our financial condition.\nThe construction of additions or modifications to CNXM\u2019s existing systems involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties beyond its control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. Financing may not be available on economically acceptable terms or at all. If these projects are undertaken, they may not be completed on schedule, at the budgeted cost or at all.\nRevenues may not increase immediately (or at all) upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if a processing facility is built, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and CNXM may not receive any material increases in revenues until the project is completed. Additionally, facilities may be constructed to capture anticipated future production growth in an area in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, new gathering, compression, dehydration, treating or other midstream assets may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve the expected investment return, which could adversely affect CNXM\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make cash distributions.\nThe construction of additions to CNXM\u2019s existing assets may require it to obtain new rights-of-way prior to constructing new pipelines or facilities, which may not be obtained in a timely fashion or in a way that allows CNXM to connect new natural gas supplies to existing gathering pipelines or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive to obtain new rights-of-way or to expand or renew existing rights-of-way. If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way increases, cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on key members of our management and our ability to attract and retain experienced technical and other professional personnel.\nOur future success depends to a large extent on the services of our key employees. The loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, competition for experienced technical and other professional personnel remains strong. If we cannot retain our current personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, our ability to compete could be adversely affected. Also, the loss of experienced personnel could lead to a loss of technical expertise.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation of CONSOL Energy, and failure to realize such benefits in a timely manner may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation of our coal business, now operated by CONSOL Energy Inc., or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The separation is expected to provide the following benefits, among others: (i) position management of each company to more effectively pursue its own focused, industry-specific strategy, creating additional operational flexibility and enabling our management team to focus on strengthening our core business, operations and other needs, and to pursue distinct and targeted opportunities for long-term growth and profitability; (ii) permit each company to efficiently allocate its capital to meet the unique needs of its own business, allowing each company to intensify its focus on its distinct business priorities and facilitate each business having a more appropriate capital aligned with its target capital levels and those of its peers, which is expected to increase access to capital; (iii) better position each company to recruit and retain executives and other employees with expertise more directly applicable to the needs of its business; allow each company more consistent application of incentive structures and targets, due to the common nature of the underlying businesses; clearer articulation of talent requirements for potential employees and understanding of the prerequisites and opportunities associated with each business; and (iv) improve understanding of each business in the capital markets and allow for a stronger, more focused investor base for each business; creation of two independent equity structures, enabling each business to use its own business-focused stock as consideration in acquisitions and equity compensation programs and creating a more efficient and valuable transaction currency and compensation tool.\nWe may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, among others: (i) we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if CONSOL Energy were still a part of the company because our business is less diversified than it was prior to the completion of the separation; and (ii) as a smaller, independent company, we may be more susceptible to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas, without having the coal business to mitigate such volatility. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the separation, or if such benefits are delayed, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCONSOL Energy may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the separation.\nIn connection with the separation, CNX and CONSOL Energy entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement and also entered into various other agreements, including a Transition Services Agreement, a Tax Matters Agreement, an Employee Matters Agreement, an Intellectual Property Matters Agreement, intellectual property license agreements, a real estate sublease, and Master Cooperation and Safety Agreements. The Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement and the Employee Matters Agreement, together with the documents and agreements by which the internal reorganization of the Company prior to the separation was effected, determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and included any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations in connection therewith. The Transition Services Agreement provides for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the separation. We will rely on CONSOL Energy to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If CONSOL Energy is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties and/or losses.\nIn connection with the separation, CONSOL Energy has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we have agreed to indemnify CONSOL Energy for certain liabilities. If we are required to pay under these indemnities to CONSOL Energy, our financial results could be negatively impacted. The CONSOL Energy indemnity may not be sufficient to hold us harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which CONSOL Energy has been allocated responsibility, and CONSOL Energy may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.\nPursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and certain other agreements with CONSOL Energy, CONSOL Energy has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we have agreed to indemnify CONSOL Energy for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. More specifically, CONSOL Energy assumed all liabilities related to their current and our former coal business, including liabilities having a book value of $955 million and liabilities that may arise due to the failure of purchasers of coal assets that we had previously disposed. Additionally, we remain liable as a guarantor on certain liabilities that\nwere assumed by CONSOL Energy in connection with the separation. The estimated value of these guarantees was approximately $192 Million at the time of the separation. Although CONSOL Energy agreed to indemnify us to the extent that we are called upon to pay any of these liabilities, there is no assurance that CONSOL Energy will satisfy its obligations to indemnify us in these situations. For example we could be liable for liabilities assumed by Murray Energy and its subsidiaries (Murray Energy) in connection with the disposition of certain mines to Murray Energy in 2013 in the event that both Murray Energy and CONSOL Energy are unable to satisfy those liabilities.\nIndemnities that we may be required to provide CONSOL Energy are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact our business. Third-parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that CONSOL Energy has agreed to retain. Any amounts we are required to pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require us to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of our operating business. Further, the indemnity from CONSOL Energy may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and CONSOL Energy may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from CONSOL Energy any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear such losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe separation of CONSOL Energy could result in substantial tax liability.\nUnder current U.S. federal income tax law, even if the distribution, together with certain related transactions, otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code, the distribution may nevertheless be rendered taxable to us and our shareholders as a result of certain post-distribution transactions, including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of CNX or CONSOL Energy. The possibility of rendering the distribution taxable as a result of such transactions may limit our ability to pursue certain equity issuances, strategic transactions or other transactions that would otherwise maximize the value of our business. Under the Tax Matters Agreement that we entered into with CONSOL Energy, CONSOL Energy may be required to indemnify us against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of CONSOL Energy, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether CONSOL Energy participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (ii) issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, (iii) repurchasing shares of CONSOL Energy stock other than in certain open-market transactions, (iv) ceasing to actively conduct certain of its businesses, (v) other actions or failures to act by CONSOL Energy or (vi) any of CONSOL Energy\u2019s representations, covenants or undertakings contained in any of the separation-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinions of tax advisors being incorrect or violated. However, the indemnity from CONSOL Energy may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such additional taxes or related liabilities, and CONSOL Energy may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from CONSOL Energy any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear such losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect CNX\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 86799, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CNX"}
