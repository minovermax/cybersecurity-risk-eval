{"cik": "1389050", "company": "Archrock, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAs described in \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d this 2021 Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements regarding us, our business and our industry. The risk factors described below, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nIndustry and General Economic Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue to negatively affect demand for our services, and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCOVID-19 continues to impact public health, economic growth, supply chains and markets. While the magnitude and duration of potential social, economic and labor instability as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be estimated at this time, we continue to closely monitor the effects of the pandemic on commodity demands and on our customers, as well as on our operations and employees. These effects may include adverse revenue and net income effects, disruptions to our operations and supply chain, customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production, employee impacts from illness, school closures and other community response measures, and temporary inaccessibility or closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers.\nThe extent to which our operating and financial results continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic, additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus. The COVID-19 pandemic may materially adversely affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nOur operations entail inherent risks that may result in substantial liability. We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.\nOur operations entail inherent risks, including equipment defects, malfunctions and failures and natural disasters, which could result in uncontrollable flows of natural gas or well fluids, fires and explosions. These risks may expose us, as an equipment operator, to liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, pollution and other environmental damage. The insurance we carry against many of these risks may not be adequate to cover our claims or losses. Our insurance coverage includes property damage, general liability and commercial automobile liability and other coverage we believe is appropriate. Additionally, we are substantially self-insured for workers\u2019 compensation and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per-incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks. We are also self-insured for property damage to our offshore assets. Further, insurance covering the risks we expect to face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future or, if available, the premiums may not be commercially justifiable. If we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nWe face significant competitive pressures that may cause us to lose market share and harm our financial performance.\nOur business is highly competitive and there are low barriers to entry. Our competitors may be able to more quickly adapt to technological changes within our industry and changes in economic and market conditions as a whole, more readily take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Our ability to renew or replace existing contract operations service agreements with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors. If our competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to the development and marketing of competitive products, equipment or services or substantially decrease the price at which they offer their products, equipment or services, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nIn addition, we could face significant competition from new entrants into the compression services business. Some of our existing competitors or new entrants may expand or fabricate new compressors that would create additional competition for the services we provide to our customers. In addition, our customers may purchase and operate their own compression fleets in lieu of using our natural gas compression services. We also may not be able to take advantage of certain opportunities or make certain investments because of our debt levels and our other obligations. Any of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, our future growth could be limited.\nOur ability to grow depends, in part, on our ability to make accretive acquisitions. If we are unable to make accretive acquisitions either because we are (i) unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with them, (ii) unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or (iii) outbid by competitors, then our future growth and ability to maintain dividends could be limited. Furthermore, even if we make acquisitions that we believe will be accretive, these acquisitions may nevertheless result in a decrease in the cash generated from operations per unit.\nAny acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022 an inability to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022 the assumption of unknown liabilities;\n\u2022 limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;\n\u2022 mistaken assumptions about the cash generated or anticipated to be generated by the business acquired or the overall costs of equity or debt;\n\u2022 the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022 unforeseen operating difficulties; and\n\u2022 customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses.\nIf we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly and we will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of our future funds and other resources. In addition, competition from other buyers could reduce our acquisition opportunities or cause us to pay a higher price than we might otherwise pay.\nFollowing the closing of the Elite Acquisition, an affiliate of Hilcorp holds a significant portion of our common stock, and Hilcorp\u2019s interest as an equity holder may conflict with the interests of our other shareholders or our noteholders.\nIn connection with the closing of the Elite Acquisition, we issued 21.7 million shares of our common stock to JDH Capital, an affiliate of our customer Hilcorp. As long as JDH Capital, together with affiliates of Hilcorp, owns at least 7.5% of our outstanding common stock, it will have the right to designate one director to our Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2021, JDH Capital owned 11.1% of our outstanding common stock. Given its ownership level and board representation, JDH Capital may have some influence over our operations and strategic direction and may have interests that conflict with the interests of other equity and debt holders.\nWhile we paid quarterly dividends of $0.145 per share of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2021, there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends in the future.\nWe paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.145 per share of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2021. We cannot provide assurance that we will, at any time in the future, again generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend or that our Board of Directors would determine to use any such surplus or our net profits to pay a dividend.\nFuture dividends may be affected by, among other factors:\n\u2022 the availability of surplus or net profits, which in turn depend on the performance of our business and operating subsidiaries;\n\u2022 our debt service requirements and other liabilities;\n\u2022 our ability to refinance our debt in the future or borrow funds and access capital markets;\n\u2022 restrictions contained in our debt agreements;\n\u2022 our future capital requirements, including to fund our operating expenses and other working capital needs;\n\u2022 the rates we charge for our services;\n\u2022 the level of demand for our services;\n\u2022 the creditworthiness of our customers;\n\u2022 our level of operating expenses; and\n\u2022 changes in U.S. federal, state and local income tax laws or corporate laws.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will declare or pay dividends in any particular amount or at all in the future. A decision not to pay dividends or a reduction in our dividend payments in the future could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nFinancial Risks\nWe have a substantial amount of debt that could limit our ability to fund future growth and operations and increase our exposure to risk during adverse economic conditions.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $1.5 billion in outstanding debt obligations, net of unamortized debt premiums and unamortized deferred financing costs. Many factors, including factors beyond our control, may affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness. These factors include those discussed elsewhere in these Risk Factors.\nOur substantial debt and associated commitments could have important adverse consequences to our liquidity, particularly to the extent our borrowing capacity becomes covenant restricted. For example, these commitments could:\n\u2022 make it more difficult for us to satisfy our contractual obligations;\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022 limit our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other corporate requirements;\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because the interest payments on a portion of our debt are based upon variable interest rates and a portion can adjust based on our credit statistics;\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022 place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or less restrictive covenants in such debt; and\n\u2022 limit our ability to incur indebtedness in the future.\nCovenants in our Debt Agreements may impair our ability to operate our business.\nOur Debt Agreements contain various covenants with which we or certain of our subsidiaries must comply, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the use of proceeds from borrowings, limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, investments, acquisitions, making loans, liens on assets, repurchasing equity, making dividends or distributions, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, dispositions of assets and other provisions customary in similar types of agreements. The Debt Agreements also contain various covenants requiring mandatory prepayments from the net cash proceeds of certain asset transfers.\nOur Credit Facility is also subject to financial covenants, including the following ratios, as defined in the corresponding agreement:\n(1) Subject to a temporary increase to 5.50 to 1.0 for any quarter during which an acquisition satisfying certain thresholds is completed and for the two quarters immediately following such quarter.\nIf we were to anticipate non-compliance with these financial ratios, we may take actions to maintain compliance with them. These actions include reductions in our general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures or the payment of cash distributions. Any of these measures may reduce the amount of cash available for payment of dividends and the funding of our business requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operations, cash flows or the price of our common stock.\nThe breach of any of the covenants under the Debt Agreements could result in a default under the Debt Agreements, which could cause indebtedness under the Debt Agreements to become due and payable. If the repayment obligations under the Debt Agreements were to be accelerated, we may not be able to repay the debt or refinance the debt on acceptable terms and our financial position would be materially adversely affected. A material adverse effect on our assets, liabilities, financial condition, business or operations that, taken as a whole, impacts our ability to perform the obligations under the Debt Agreements could lead to a default under those agreements. Further, a default under one or more of the Debt Agreements would trigger cross-default provisions under the other Debt Agreements, which would accelerate our obligation to repay the indebtedness under those agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Debt Agreements.\nWe may be unable to access the capital and credit markets or borrow on affordable terms to obtain additional capital that we may require.\nHistorically, we have financed acquisitions, operating expenditures and capital expenditures with a combination of cash provided by operating and financing activities. However, to the extent we are unable to finance our operating expenditures, capital expenditures, scheduled interest and debt repayments and any future dividends with net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the Credit Facility, we may require additional capital. Periods of instability in the capital and credit markets (both generally and in the oil and gas industry in particular) could limit our ability to access these markets to raise debt or equity capital on affordable terms or to obtain additional financing. Among other things, our lenders may seek to increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt at maturity at favorable terms or at all and may reduce or cease to provide funding to us. If we are unable to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, or if we are not successful in raising capital within the time period required or at all, we may not be able to grow or maintain our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to fund purchases of additional compression equipment could adversely impact our financial results.\nWe may not be able to maintain or increase our asset and customer base unless we have access to sufficient capital to purchase additional compression equipment. Cash flow from our operations and availability under our Credit Facility may not provide us with sufficient cash to fund our capital expenditure requirements, including any funding requirements related to acquisitions. Our ability to grow our asset and customer base could be impacted by limits on our ability to access additional capital.\nWe may be vulnerable to interest rate increases due to our variable rate debt obligations.\nAfter taking into consideration interest rate swaps, we did not have any outstanding indebtedness that was subject to variable interest rates as of December 31, 2021. However, our interest rate swaps mature in the first quarter of 2022, at which time all borrowings under our Credit Facility will be subject to variable interest rates. Changes in economic conditions outside of our control could result in higher interest rates, thereby increasing our interest expense and reducing the funds available for capital investment, operations or other purposes. In addition, a substantial portion of our cash flow must be used to service our debt obligations. Any increase in our interest expense could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows, including our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nUncertainty relating to the phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect the market value of our current or future debt obligations, including our Credit Facility.\nOn May 3, 2021, the FCA announced that certain U.S. dollar LIBOR rates, including the 1-month rate used to determine the amount of interest payable related to borrowings under our Credit Facility, will cease to be provided after June 30, 2023. In the U.S., efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates that could replace LIBOR include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Our Credit Facility agreement requires that we execute an amendment that establishes an alternate reference rate should the 1-month U.S. dollar LIBOR cease to be published, to be agreed upon by us and the lenders under the facility. The alternate reference rate selected may result in interest obligations which are more than or do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on any current or future debt obligations, including the Credit Facility, if U.S. dollar LIBOR was available in its current form. Replacement of the 1-month U.S. dollar LIBOR may, therefore, materially adversely affect the market value of, the applicable interest rate on and the amount of interest paid on our current or future debt obligations, including the Credit Facility.\nCustomer and Contract Risks\nThe erosion of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business.\nMany of our customers finance their exploration and production activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. During times when the oil or natural gas markets weaken, our customers are more likely to experience a downturn in their financial condition. Additionally, some of our midstream customers may provide their gathering, transportation and related services to a limited number of companies in the oil and gas production business. A reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities, the lack of availability of debt or equity financing or other factors that negatively impact our customers\u2019 financial condition could result in a reduction in our customers\u2019 spending for our products and services, which may result in their cancellation of contracts, the cancellation or delay of scheduled maintenance of their existing natural gas compression equipment, their determination not to enter into new natural gas compression service contracts or their determination to cancel or delay orders for our services. Furthermore, the loss by our midstream customers of their key customers could reduce demand for their services and result in a deterioration of their financial condition, which would in turn decrease their demand for our services. Any such action by our customers would reduce demand for our services. Reduced demand for our services could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, in the event of the financial failure of a customer, we could experience a loss on all or a portion of our outstanding accounts receivable associated with that customer.\nThe loss of any of our most significant customers would result in a decline in our revenue and cash available to pay dividends to our common stockholders.\nOur five most significant customers collectively accounted for 31%, 28% and 25% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our services are provided to these customers pursuant to contract operations service agreements, which typically have an initial term of 12 to 48 months and continue thereafter until terminated by either party with 30 days\u2019 advance notice. The loss of all or even a portion of the services we provide to these customers, as a result of competition or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany of our contract operations service agreements have short initial terms and are cancelable on short notice after the initial term, and we cannot be sure that such contracts will be extended or renewed after the end of the initial contractual term. Any such nonrenewals, or renewals at reduced rates or the loss of contracts with any significant customer could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe length of our contract operations service agreements with customers varies based on operating conditions and customer needs. Our initial contract terms typically are not long enough to enable us to recoup the cost of the equipment we utilize to provide contract operations services, and these contracts are typically cancelable on short notice after the initial term. We cannot be sure that a substantial number of these contracts will be extended or renewed by our customers or that any of our customers will continue to contract with us. The inability to negotiate extensions or renew a substantial portion of our contract operations services contracts, the renewal of such contracts at reduced rates, the inability to contract for additional services with our customers or the loss of all or a significant portion of our services contracts with any significant customer could lead to a reduction in revenue and net income and could require us to record asset impairments. This could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nLabor and Supply Chain Risks\nOur ability to manage and grow our business effectively may be adversely affected if we lose management or operational personnel.\nWe believe that our ability to hire, train and retain qualified personnel will continue to be challenging and important. The supply of experienced operational and field personnel, in particular, decreases as other energy companies\u2019 needs for the same personnel increase. Our ability to grow and to continue our current level of service to our customers will be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully hire, train and retain these important personnel. In addition, the cost of labor has increased and may continue to increase in the future with increases in demand, which could require us to incur additional costs and negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe depend on particular suppliers and are vulnerable to product shortages and price increases. With respect to our suppliers of newly-fabricated compression equipment specifically, we occasionally experience long lead times, and therefore may at times make purchases in anticipation of future business. If we are unable to purchase compression equipment or other integral equipment, materials and services from third party suppliers, we may be unable to retain existing customers or compete for new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome equipment, materials and services used in our business are obtained from a limited group of suppliers. Our reliance on these suppliers involves several risks, including price increases, inferior quality and a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of such equipment, materials and services in a timely manner. Additionally, we occasionally experience long lead times from our suppliers of newly-fabricated compression equipment and may at times make purchases in anticipation of future business. We do not have long-term contracts with some of these suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of certain of these suppliers could have a negative impact on our results of operations and could damage our customer relationships.\nIf we are unable to purchase compression equipment, in particular, on a timely basis to meet the demands of our customers, our existing customers may terminate their contractual relationships with us, or we may not be able to compete for business from new or existing customers, which, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, supply chain bottlenecks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary materials, parts or lube oil used in our operations or increase the costs of such items. A significant increase in the price of such equipment, materials and services, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nInformation Technology and Cybersecurity Risks\nWe may not realize the intended benefits of our process and technology transformation project, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we began a process and technology transformation project, which has, among other things, replaced our existing ERP, supply chain and inventory management systems and expanded the remote monitoring capabilities of our compression fleet. By using technology to make our systems and processes more efficient, we intend to lower our internal costs and improve our profitability over time. However, the implementation of the process and technology transformation project has required significant capital and other resources from which we may not realize the benefits we expect to realize. Any such difficulties could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThreats of cyber-attacks or terrorism could affect our business.\nWe may be threatened by problems such as cyber-attacks, computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results. Our industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite our implementation of security measures, our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes. If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our assets may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to service our customers. We may be required by our regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict. The implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance, to the extent available, addressing such activities could increase costs. These types of events could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, these types of events could require significant management attention and resources and could adversely affect our reputation among customers and the public.\nTax-related Risks\nTax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in locations throughout the U.S. and, as a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state and local governments. From time to time, various legislative or administrative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our tax provision or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, U.S. federal, state and local tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.\nOur ability to use NOLs to offset future income may be limited.\nOur ability to use any NOLs generated by us could be substantially limited if we were to experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Code. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d would occur if our \u201c5-percent stockholders,\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Code, including certain groups of persons treated as \u201c5-percent stockholders,\u201d collectively increased their ownership in us by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. An ownership change can occur as a result of a public offering of our common stock, as well as through secondary market purchases of our common stock and certain types of reorganization transactions. We have experienced ownership changes, which may result in an annual limitation on the use of its pre-ownership change NOLs (and certain other losses and/or credits) equal to the equity value of our stock immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate for the month in which the ownership change occurs. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Federal Reserve has lowered the long-term tax-exempt rate. Market volatility due to reduced demand from the COVID-19 pandemic and oil oversupply and the related decrease in our equity value may cause increased interest in our common stock, which may result in an additional ownership change. Both of these changes could further limit our use of pre-ownership change NOLs if we experience an additional ownership change. Furthermore, the IRS has recently proposed regulations that would prevent us from using unrealized built-in gains to increase this limitation. If these regulations were finalized and we experienced an ownership change our ability to use our NOLs may be limited. Such a limitation could, for any given year, have the effect of increasing the amount of our U.S. federal income tax liability, which would negatively impact the amount of after-tax cash available for distribution to our stockholders and our financial condition.\nWe are subject to continuing contingent tax liabilities following the Spin-off.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, we entered into a tax matters agreement with Exterran Corporation that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the Exterran Holdings consolidated U.S. federal and state tax reporting group between us and Exterran Corporation. If Exterran Corporation is unable to pay any prior period taxes related to these consolidated U.S. federal and state tax filings for which it is responsible, we would be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various claims, tax audits, litigation and other proceedings that could ultimately be resolved against us and require material future cash payments or charges, which could impair our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe size, nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to various claims, tax audits, litigation and binding arbitration proceedings. We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to various claims, which, if not resolved within amounts we have accrued, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, including our ability to pay dividends. Similarly, any claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future. See Part I Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Note 26 (\u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d) to our Financial Statements for additional information regarding certain legal proceedings to which we are a party.\nU.S. federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect demand for our contract operations services.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. We do not perform hydraulic fracturing, but many of our customers do. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state agencies, but recently, there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies, and proposals have been made to enact separate U.S. federal, state and local legislation that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing.\nOn January 27, 2021, the POTUS issued an executive order directing the Secretary of the Interior to pause all new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices in light of potential climate and other impacts associated with oil and natural gas activities thereon. Some legal challenges to the suspension have been successful and the current administration has resumed leasing activities, although there are substantial indications that future leasing activities will involve more stringent environmental conditions.\nAt the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, in May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. Local governments may also seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular.\nWhile we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such recent developments, if new or more stringent U.S. federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where our natural gas exploration and production customers operate, those customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. Any such restrictions could reduce demand for our contract operations services, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNew regulations, proposed regulations and proposed modifications to existing regulations under the CAA, if implemented, could result in increased compliance costs.\nIn June 2016, the EPA issued final regulations amending the NSPS for the oil and natural gas source category and applying to sources of emissions of methane and VOC from certain processes, activities and equipment that is constructed, modified or reconstructed after September 18, 2015. Specifically, the regulation contains both methane and VOC standards for several emission sources not previously covered by the NSPS, such as fugitive emissions from compressor stations and pneumatic pumps and methane standards for certain emission sources that are already regulated for VOC, such as equipment leaks at natural gas processing plants. The amendments also establish methane standards for a subset of equipment that the current NSPS regulates, including reciprocating compressors and pneumatic controllers, and extend the current VOC standards to the remaining unregulated equipment.\nWhile the EPA in 2020 adopted deregulatory amendments to the 2016 rule that removed the transmission and storage segments from the oil and natural gas source category and rescinded the methane-specific requirements for production and processing facilities, that 2020 rulemaking was voided by action of Congress and the President effective June 30, 2021. As a result, the 2016 rules became effective again immediately. Further, in November 2021, the EPA proposed the framework for more stringent methane rules for newer sources, along with emissions standards that will for the first time be applicable to existing sources. The actual proposed rule language is expected to be published in early 2022, and a final rule likely in the second half of 2022, following a public notice and comment period. The current administration and the EPA have indicated that additional rule proposals on oil and gas-related methane emissions are in the works.\nMeanwhile, several states-including, most notably, New Mexico and Colorado-have been developing their own more stringent methane rules that will or are anticipated to impose additional requirements on the industry and that may be effective sooner than any new EPA rules. We, together with a consortium of other Gas Compressor Association member companies, were actively involved in the rulemaking effort in New Mexico, including working directly with the New Mexico Environmental Department and participating in the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board\u2019s hearing in late 2021.\nWe do not believe that the current rules will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, but we cannot yet definitively predict the impact of any revision of the current rules or issuance of new rules, which impact could be material.\nOn October 1, 2015, the EPA issued a new NAAQS ozone standard of 70 ppb, which is a tightening from the 75 ppb standard set in 2008. This new standard became effective on December 28, 2015, and the EPA completed designating attainment/non-attainment regions under the revised ozone standard in 2018. In November 2016, the EPA proposed an implementation rule for the 2015 NAAQS ozone standard, but the agency has yet to issue a final implementation rule. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our customers\u2019 ability to obtain such permits and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. By law, the EPA must review each NAAQS every five years. In December 2018 and again in December 2020, the EPA announced that it was retaining without revision the 2015 NAAQS ozone standard. Those decisions have been subject to judicial challenge. In October 2021, the EPA revealed in court filings that it will revisit the December 2020 decision to retain the existing ozone standard. We do not believe continued implementation of the NAAQS ozone standard will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, but we cannot yet predict the impact, if any, of any new Federal Implementation Plan or of the possible reconsideration and issuance of new NAAQS standards.\nNew environmental regulations and proposals similar to these, when finalized, and any other new regulations requiring the installation of more sophisticated pollution control equipment or the adoption of other environmental protection measures, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Notably, opposition to energy development and infrastructure projects has led to regulatory and judicial challenges to new facilities, including compression facilities, in states such as Massachusetts and Virginia. While we have not directly faced any such challenges to the facilities at which we provide contract operations and know of no pending or threatened efforts targeting those facilities, expanded opposition to energy infrastructure, including facilities at which we provide contract operations, could potentially give rise to material impacts in the future.\nWe are subject to a variety of governmental regulations; failure to comply with these regulations may result in administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures and changes in these regulations could increase our costs or liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, including relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment and taxation. Many of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including assessment of monetary penalties, imposition of remedial requirements and issuance of injunctions as to future compliance. From time to time, as part of our operations, including newly acquired operations, we may be subject to compliance audits by regulatory authorities in the various states in which we operate.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, which may render us liable for remediation costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior owners or operators or other third parties. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for neighboring land owners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs. Remediation costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations, and costs associated with new information, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could negatively impact our financial condition, profitability and results of operations. Moreover, failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations. Notably, the current administration has indicated an intention to expand environmental enforcement efforts, and that it plans to target for enhanced enforcement locations and violations that involve harm to minority and low-income communities that historically have faced disproportionate environmental burdens.\nWe may need to apply for or amend facility permits or licenses from time to time with respect to storm water or wastewater discharges, waste handling, or air emissions relating to manufacturing activities or equipment operations, which subjects us to new or revised permitting conditions that may be onerous or costly to comply with. In addition, certain of our customer service arrangements may require us to operate, on behalf of a specific customer, petroleum storage units such as underground tanks or pipelines and other regulated units, all of which may impose additional compliance and permitting obligations.\nWe conduct operations at numerous facilities in a wide variety of locations across the continental U.S. The operations at many of these facilities require environmental permits or other authorizations. Additionally, natural gas compressors at many of our customers\u2019 facilities require individual air permits or general authorizations to operate under various air regulatory programs established by rule or regulation. These permits and authorizations frequently contain numerous compliance requirements, including monitoring and reporting obligations and operational restrictions, such as emission limits. Given the large number of facilities in which we operate, and the numerous environmental permits and other authorizations that are applicable to our operations, we may occasionally identify or be notified of technical violations of certain requirements existing in various permits or other authorizations. Occasionally, we have been assessed penalties for our non-compliance, and we could be subject to such penalties in the future.\nWe routinely deal with natural gas, oil and other petroleum products. Hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on, under or from properties used by us to provide contract operations services or inactive compression storage or on or under other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties may be subject to investigatory, remediation and monitoring requirements under environmental laws and regulations.\nThe modification or interpretation of existing environmental laws or regulations, the more vigorous enforcement of existing environmental laws or regulations, or the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may also negatively impact oil and natural gas exploration and production, gathering and pipeline companies, including our customers, which in turn could have a negative impact on us.\nClimate change legislation, regulatory initiatives and stakeholder pressures could result in increased compliance costs, financial risks and potential reduction in demand for our services.\nClimate change legislation and regulatory initiatives may arise from a variety of sources, including international, national, regional and state levels of government and associated administrative bodies, seeking to restrict or regulate emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane.\nCongress has previously considered legislation to restrict or regulate emissions of greenhouse gases. Energy legislation and other initiatives continue to be proposed that may be relevant to greenhouse gas emissions issues. Almost half of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun to address greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Although most of the state-level initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as electric power plants, it is possible that smaller sources such as our natural gas-powered compressors could become subject to greenhouse gas-related regulation. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to control emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations. The $1 trillion legislative infrastructure package passed by Congress in November 2021 includes a number of climate-focused spending initiatives targeted at climate resilience, enhanced response and preparation for extreme weather events, and clean energy and transportation investments. Significant additional legislative proposals are also under consideration in Congress in early 2022 that reportedly could provide significant funding for research and development of low-carbon energy production methods, carbon capture, and other programs directed at addressing climate change.\nIndependent of Congress, the EPA has promulgated regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions under its existing CAA authority. The EPA has adopted rules requiring many facilities, including petroleum and natural gas systems, to inventory and report their greenhouse gas emissions. In 2021, we did not operate any facilities that were subject to these reporting obligations. In addition, the EPA rules provide air permitting requirements for certain large sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The requirement for large sources of greenhouse gas emissions to obtain and comply with permits will affect some of our and our customers\u2019 largest new or modified facilities going forward, but is not expected to cause us to incur material costs. As noted above, the EPA has undertaken efforts to regulate emissions of methane, considered a greenhouse gas, in the oil and gas sector, with the development of additional, more stringent rules under way.\nIn an executive order issued on January 20, 2021, the POTUS asked the heads of all executive departments and agencies to review and take action to address any federal regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies and any similar agency actions promulgated during the prior administration that may be inconsistent with or present obstacles to the administration\u2019s stated goals of protecting public health and the environment, and conserving national monuments and refuges. The executive order also established an Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases, which is called on to, among other things, capture the full costs of greenhouse gas emissions, including the \u201csocial cost of carbon,\u201d \u201csocial cost of nitrous oxide\u201d and \u201csocial cost of methane,\u201d which are \u201cthe monetized damages associated with incremental increases in greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d including \u201cchanges in net agricultural productivity, human health, property damage from increased flood risk, and the value of ecosystem services.\u201d The current administration adopted an interim social cost of carbon of $51 per ton in February 2021, with an updated cost figure expected early in 2022. That figure is intended to be used to guide federal decisions on the costs and benefits of various policies and approvals, although such efforts have been the subject of a series of judicial challenges. At this time, we cannot determine whether the administration\u2019s efforts on social cost or other interagency climate efforts will lead to any particular actions that give rise to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAt the international level, the U.S. joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France, which resulted in an agreement intended to nationally determine their contributions and set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. While the Agreement did not impose direct requirements on emitters, national plans to meet its pledge could have resulted in new regulatory requirements. In November 2019, however, plans were formally announced for the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Agreement with an effective exit date in November 2020. In April 2021, the current administration announced reentry of the U.S. into the Paris Agreement along with a new \u201cnationally determined contribution\u201d for U.S. greenhouse gas emissions that would achieve emissions reductions of at least 50% relative to 2005 levels by 2030. Those national commitments by themselves create no binding requirements on individual companies or facilities, but they do provide indications of the current administration\u2019s policy direction and the types of legislative and regulatory requirements-such as the EPA\u2019s proposed methane rules-that may be needed to achieve those commitments. Relatedly, the U.S. and European Union jointly announced the launch of the \u201cGlobal Methane Pledge,\u201d which aims to cut global methane pollution at least 30% by 2030 relative to 2020 levels, including \u201call feasible reductions\u201d in the energy sector. With the exception of those proposed EPA methane rules, which were announced by the POTUS at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in November 2021, we cannot predict whether re-entry into the Paris Agreement or pledges made in connection therewith will result in any particular new regulatory requirements or whether such requirements will cause us to incur material costs.\nAlthough it is not currently possible to predict how these executive orders, national commitments or any proposed or future greenhouse gas or climate change legislation or regulation promulgated by Congress, the states or multi-state regions will impact our business, any regulation of greenhouse gas emissions that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions or reduced demand for our services, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nApart from governmental regulation, there are also increasing financial risks for companies in the energy sector as shareholders and bondholders currently invested in energy companies may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments toward non-fossil fuel energy sources. In recent years there have been increased efforts to encourage the consideration of ESG practices of companies in making investment decisions and, as a result, investment banks and asset managers based both domestically and internationally have announced that they are adopting climate change guidelines for their banking and investing activities. Institutional lenders who provide financing to energy companies such as ourselves have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices, and some may elect not to provide traditional energy producers or companies that support such producers with funding. ESG considerations may also affect others in the investment community, including investment advisers, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds and other groups, and may result in their divestment of energy-related equities. Limitation of investments in and financings for energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of infrastructure projects and energy production activities. This potential for reduced access to the capital and financial markets, whether impacting our customers and/or our company, may further adversely affect the demand for and price of our securities.\nFurthermore, at this time, there is significant uncertainty with respect to the extent to which climate change may lead to more extreme weather patterns, but it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere can change the climate in a manner that results in significant weather-related effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other such events. Energy needs could increase or decrease as a result of extreme weather conditions depending on the duration and magnitude of any such climate changes. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in order to serve increased demand. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition through decreased revenues. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing service. If any of these results occur, it could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations and cause us to incur costs in preparing for and responding to them.\nIn sum, any legislation, regulatory programs or social pressures related to climate change could increase our costs and require substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs, reduce demand for our services and reduce our access to financial markets. Current, as well as potential future, laws and regulations that limit emissions of greenhouse gases or that otherwise promote the use of renewable energy over fossil fuel energy sources could increase the cost of our midstream services and, thereby, further reduce demand and adversely affect the company\u2019s sales volumes, revenues and margins.\nIncreased environmental, social and governance scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders may impose additional costs or additional risks.\nIn recent years, increasing attention has been given to corporate activities related to ESG matters. A number of advocacy groups, both domestically and internationally, have campaigned for governmental and private action to promote change at public companies related to ESG matters, including increasing attention and demands for action related to climate change, promoting the use of substitutes to fossil fuel products and encouraging the divestment of companies in the fossil fuel industry. Companies which do not adapt to or comply with expectations and standards on ESG matters, as they continue to evolve, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition and/or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur operations, projects and growth opportunities require us to have strong relationships with various key stakeholders, including our shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers, local communities and others. We may face pressures from stakeholders, many of whom are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize sustainable energy practices, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability while at the same time remaining a successfully operating public company. If we do not successfully manage expectations across these varied stakeholder interests, it could erode our stakeholder trust and thereby affect our brand and reputation. Such erosion of confidence could negatively impact our business through decreased demand and growth opportunities, delays in projects, increased legal action and regulatory oversight, adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements, difficulty hiring and retaining top talent, difficulty obtaining necessary approvals and permits from governments and regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on acceptable terms, and difficulty securing investors and access to capital. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 92245, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "AROC"}
