{"cik": "1524358", "company": "MARRIOTT VACATIONS WORLDWIDE Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis section describes circumstances or events that could have a negative effect on our financial results or operations or that could change, for the worse, existing trends in our businesses. The occurrence of one or more of the circumstances or events described below could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or on the trading prices of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that currently are not known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may adversely affect our businesses and operations.\nContraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth could impact our financial results and growth.\nOur business and the vacation ownership industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy, and the recovery period in our industry may lag behind overall economic improvement. Demand for vacation ownership industry products and services is linked to a number of factors relating to general global, national and regional economic conditions, including perceived and actual economic conditions, exchange rates, availability of credit and business and personal discretionary spending levels. Weakened consumer confidence and limited availability of consumer credit can cause demand for our vacation ownership products to decline, which may reduce our revenue and profitability. Because a significant portion of our expenses, including personnel costs, interest, property taxes and insurance, are relatively fixed, we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset revenue decreases. Adverse economic conditions may also cause purchaser defaults on our vacation ownership notes receivable to increase. In addition, adverse global and national economic and political events, as well as significant terrorist attacks, are likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general, which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price.\nThe sale of vacation ownership interests in the secondary market by existing owners could cause our sales revenues and profits to decline.\nExisting owners have offered, and are expected to continue to offer, their vacation ownership interests for sale on the secondary market. The prices at which these interests are sold are typically less than the prices at which we would sell the interests. As a result, these sales can create pricing pressure on our sale of vacation ownership products, which could cause our sales revenues and profits to decline. In addition, if the secondary market for vacation ownership interests becomes more organized and liquid than it currently is, the resulting availability of vacation ownership interests (particularly where the vacation ownership interests are available for sale at lower prices than the prices at which we would sell them) could adversely affect our sales and our sales revenues. Further, unlawful or deceptive third-party vacation ownership interest resale schemes involving interests in our resorts could damage our reputation and brand value and adversely impact our sales revenues.\nDevelopment of a viable secondary market may also cause the volume of vacation ownership interests inventory that we are able to repurchase to decline, which could adversely impact our development margin, as we utilize this lower cost inventory source to supplement our inventory needs and reduce our cost of vacation ownership products.\nOur ability to develop, acquire and repurchase vacation ownership inventory may be impaired if we or third parties with whom we do business are unable to access capital when necessary.\nThe availability of funds for new investments, primarily developing, acquiring or repurchasing vacation ownership inventory, depends in part on liquidity factors and capital markets over which we can exert little, if any, control. We have historically securitized the majority of the consumer loans we originate in support of our North America segment in the ABS market, completing transactions once each year for the past several years. Instability in the financial markets could impact the timing and volume of any securitizations we undertake, as well as the financial terms of such securitizations. Any future deterioration in the financial markets could preclude, delay or increase the cost to us of future note securitizations. Such deterioration could also impact our ability to renew the Warehouse Credit Facility, which we must do in order to access funds under that facility after March 2019, on terms favorable to us, or at all. Further, any indebtedness we incur, including indebtedness under our Revolving Corporate Credit Facility or our Warehouse Credit Facility, may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to access these sources of funds, our ability to acquire additional vacation ownership inventory, repurchase vacation ownership interests that our owners propose to sell to third parties, or make other investments in our business could be impaired.\nOur reliance on capital efficient transactions to satisfy a portion of our future needs for inventory and additional on-site sales locations may impact our ability to have inventory available for sale when needed.\nWe have entered into capital efficient transactions in which third parties are responsible for delivering completed units which we expect to purchase at pre-agreed prices in the future. As we continue to execute our strategy to deploy capital efficiently, we will seek to enter into additional transactions to source inventory using similar or new transaction structures. These structures may expose us to additional risk as we will not control development activities or timing of development completion. If third parties with whom we enter into capital efficient transactions do not fulfill their obligations to us, or if they exercise their right to sell inventory to a third party other than us, the inventory we expect to acquire may not be delivered on time or at all, or may not otherwise be within agreed upon specifications. If our capital efficient transaction counterparties do not perform as expected and we do not purchase the expected inventory or obtain inventory from alternative sources on a timely basis, we may not be able to achieve sales forecasts. In addition, we anticipate opening new on-site sales locations in connection with some or all of our new resort locations. If third parties with whom we enter into transactions do not deliver these sales locations as expected, our future sales growth could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, as discussed above, we intend to continue to use capital efficient structures to optimize the timing of our capital investments. If developers or other third parties are not able to obtain or maintain financing necessary for their operations, we may not be able to enter into transactions using these capital efficient structures.\nThe degree to which we are leveraged may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe can borrow up to $250.0 million under the Revolving Corporate Credit Facility and could also incur additional debt to the extent permitted under the Revolving Corporate Credit Facility. Our ability to make dividend payments to holders of our common stock and to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness, including debt under the Revolving Corporate Credit Facility, the Warehouse Credit Facility or our 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) or any future debt that we may incur, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that we cannot control. If we cannot repay or refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions, including (1) reducing capital expenditures, (2) limiting financing offered to customers, which could result in reduced sales, and (3) dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow\nfrom operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the vacation ownership industry could be impaired. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of the Convertible Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Revolving Corporate Credit Facility could terminate their commitments to loan money, lenders under our secured debt (including any borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Corporate Credit Facility) could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If lenders of any of our debt are able to accelerate amounts due to them, a default or acceleration of our other debt could be triggered.\nA lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our company or any of our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\nAny rating assigned to our company or our debt, including the Convertible Notes, could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. Any future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing.\nThe terms of any future preferred equity or debt financing may give holders of any preferred equity or debt securities rights that are senior to rights of our common shareholders or dilute the ownership percentage of existing shareholders or impose more stringent operating restrictions on our company.\nDebt or equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock or convertible securities such as the Convertible Notes, the terms of the debt or the preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders would be diluted.\nIf the default rates or other credit metrics underlying our vacation ownership notes receivable deteriorate, our vacation ownership notes receivable securitization program could be adversely affected.\nOur vacation ownership notes receivable securitization program could be adversely affected if a particular vacation ownership notes receivable pool fails to meet certain ratios, which could occur if the default rates or other credit metrics of the underlying vacation ownership notes receivable deteriorate. Default rates may deteriorate due to many different reasons, including those beyond our control, such as financial hardship of purchasers. Our ability to sell securities backed by our vacation ownership notes receivable depends on the continued ability and willingness of capital market participants to invest in such securities. Asset-backed securities issued in our securitization programs could be downgraded by credit agencies in the future. If a downgrade occurs, our ability to complete other securitization transactions on acceptable terms or at all could be jeopardized, and we could be forced to rely on other potentially more expensive and less attractive funding sources, to the extent available. This would decrease our profitability and might require us to adjust our business operations, including by reducing or suspending our provision of financing to purchasers of vacation ownership interests. Sales of vacation ownership interests may decline if we reduce or suspend the provision of financing to purchasers, which may adversely affect our cash flows, revenues and profits.\nPurchaser defaults on the vacation ownership notes receivable our business generates could reduce our revenues, cash flows and profits.\nWe are subject to the risk that purchasers of our vacation ownership interests may default on the financing that we provide. The risk of purchaser defaults may increase due to man-made or natural disasters, that cause financial hardship for purchasers. Purchaser defaults could cause us to foreclose on vacation ownership notes receivable and reclaim ownership of the financed interests, both for loans that we have not securitized and in our role as servicer for the vacation ownership notes receivable we have securitized through the ABS market or the Warehouse Credit Facility.\nIf default rates increase beyond current projections and result in higher than expected foreclosure activity, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, the transactions in which we have securitized vacation ownership notes receivable contain certain portfolio performance requirements related to default and delinquency rates, which, if not met, would result in loss or disruption of cash flow until portfolio performance sufficiently improves to satisfy the requirements. In addition, we may not be able to resell foreclosed interests in a timely manner or for an attractive price.\nOur operations outside of the United States make us susceptible to the risks of doing business internationally, which could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits or disrupt our business.\nWe conduct business in over 30 countries and territories, and our operations outside the United States represented approximately 13 percent of our revenues, excluding cost reimbursements, in 2017. International properties and operations expose us to a number of additional challenges and risks, including the following, any of which could reduce our revenues or profits, increase our costs, or disrupt our business:\n\u2022\ncomplex and changing laws, regulations and policies of governments that may impact our operations, including foreign ownership restrictions, import and export controls, and trade restrictions;\n\u2022\nincreases in anti-American sentiment and the identification of our brands as American brands;\n\u2022\nU.S. laws that affect the activities of U.S. companies abroad;\n\u2022\nthe presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets and the effect of various anti-corruption and other laws;\n\u2022\ntax impacts associated with the repatriation of our non-U.S. earnings;\n\u2022\nthe difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries;\n\u2022\nuncertainties as to the enforceability of contract and intellectual property rights under local laws;\n\u2022\nrapid changes in government policy, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates or currency restructurings and hyperinflation or deflation in the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nforced nationalization of resort properties by local, state or national governments; and\n\u2022\nother exposure to local economic risks.\nWe also derive revenue from sales to customers from outside the United States that are transacted in United States dollars. As a result, factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the markets in which our customers reside could reduce our revenues or profits.\nA failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position.\nOur business model and competitive conditions in the vacation ownership industry demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems, including those used for our sales, reservation, inventory management and property management systems, and technologies we make available to our owners. We must refine, update and/or replace these technologies and systems with more advanced systems on a regular basis. If we cannot do so as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames, our business could suffer. We also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system, and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could harm our operating results.\nFailure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions or operational inefficiencies, damage our reputation and/or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits.\nWe collect and retain large volumes of internal and customer data, including social security numbers, credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers in various internal information systems and information systems of our service providers. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The integrity and protection of that customer, employee and company data is critical to us. We could make faulty decisions if that data is inaccurate or incomplete. Our customers and employees also have a high expectation that we and our service providers will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment as well as the requirements imposed on us by the payment card industry surrounding information, security and privacy is also increasingly demanding, in both the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our systems may be unable to satisfy changing regulatory and payment card industry requirements and employee and customer expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so.\nOur information systems and records, including those we maintain with our service providers, may be subject to security breaches, cyber attacks, system failures, viruses, operator error or inadvertent releases of data. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, employee or company data maintained by us or by a service provider could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses, fines or litigation. For example, failure to comply with Europe\u2019s new GDPR, which will become effective in May 2018, could result in fines of up to 4 percent of annual worldwide \u201cturnover\u201d (a measure similar to revenues in the United States). A breach in the security of our information systems or those of our service providers could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems, resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits.\nA failure to keep pace with developments in social media could impair our competitive position.\nThe proliferation and global reach of social media continues to expand rapidly and could cause us to suffer reputational harm. The continuing evolution of social media presents new challenges and requires us to keep pace with new developments, technology and trends. Negative posts or comments about us, the properties we manage or our brands on any social networking or user-generated review website, including travel and vacation property websites, could affect consumer opinions of us and our products, and we cannot guarantee that we will timely or adequately redress such instances.\nInadequate or failed technologies could lead to interruptions in our operations, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur operations depend on our ability to maintain existing systems and implement new technologies, which includes allocating sufficient resources to periodically upgrade our information technology systems, and to protect our equipment and the information stored in our databases against both manmade and natural disasters, as well as power losses, computer and telecommunications failures, technological breakdowns, unauthorized intrusions, cyber-attacks, and other events. Conversions to new information technology systems require effective change management processes and may result in cost overruns, delays or business interruptions. If our information technology systems are disrupted, become obsolete or do not adequately support our strategic, operational or compliance needs, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected.\nOur industry is competitive, which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other vacation ownership brands and with other vacation rental options for customers.\nA number of highly competitive companies participate in the vacation ownership industry, including several that are affiliated with branded hotel companies. We believe that competition in the vacation ownership industry is driven primarily by the quality, number and location of vacation ownership resorts, trust in the brand, pricing of product offerings and the availability of program benefits, such as exchange programs and access to affiliated hotel networks. Our brands compete with the vacation ownership brands of major hotel chains in national and international venues, as well as with the vacation rental options (such as hotels, resorts and condominium rentals) offered by the lodging industry. Innovations that impact the industry may also lead to new products and services that could disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors.\nRecent and potential future consolidation in the highly fragmented vacation ownership industry may increase competition. For example, ILG, Inc., which operates the Interval International exchange program, acquired Hyatt Residence Club in October 2014 and Vistana Signature Experiences, Inc. (which includes the Westin and Sheraton brands) in May 2016. Diamond Resorts International, Inc. completed the acquisition of the vacation ownership business of Gold Key Resorts in October 2015 and the acquisition of the vacation ownership business of Intrawest Resort Club Group in January 2016. Consolidation may create competitors that enjoy significant advantages resulting from, among other things, a lower cost of, and greater access to, capital and enhanced operating efficiencies.\nCompetition in the vacation ownership industry may also increase as private competitors become publicly traded companies or existing publicly traded competitors spin-off their vacation ownership operations. For example, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. completed the spin-off of its vacation ownership operations in January 2017, and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. is now a separate publicly traded company. In August 2017, Wyndham Worldwide announced plans to spin off its hotel business during the first half of 2018 resulting in two separate, publicly traded companies, including a publicly traded vacation ownership company. In November 2017, Bluegreen Vacations Corporation completed an initial public offering that resulted in approximately 10 percent of its stock being held by the public. Competitors that are publicly traded companies may benefit from a lower cost of, and greater access to, capital, as well as more focused management attention.\nIn addition, under our License Agreements with Marriott International and The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, if other international hotel operators offer new products and services as part of their respective hotel businesses that may directly compete with our vacation ownership products and services in the future, then Marriott International and The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company may also offer such new products and services, and use their respective trademarks in connection with such offers. If Marriott International or The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company offer new vacation ownership products and services under their trademarks, our vacation ownership products and services may compete directly with those of Marriott International or The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, and we may not be able to distinguish our vacation ownership products and services from those offered by Marriott International and The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company. Our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain owners depends on our success in distinguishing the quality and value of our products and services from those offered by others. If we cannot compete successfully in these areas, this could limit our operating margins, diminish our market share and reduce our earnings.\nOur business will be materially harmed if our License Agreements with Marriott International and The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company are terminated or if we are unable to maintain our ongoing relationship with Marriott International.\nOur success depends, in part, on the maintenance of ongoing relationships with Marriott International that are governed by a number of agreements that we entered into with Marriott International in connection with the Spin-Off. In particular, our License Agreements with Marriott International and The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, among other things, provide us with the exclusive right to use the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton names, respectively, in our vacation ownership business. Each License Agreement has an initial term that expires in 2090; however, if we breach our obligations under either License Agreement, Marriott International and The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company may be entitled to terminate the License Agreements.\nThe termination of the License Agreements would materially harm our business and results of operations and impair our ability to market and sell our products and maintain our competitive position, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For example, we would not be able to rely on the strength of the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton brands to attract qualified prospects in the marketplace, which would cause our revenue and profits to decline and our marketing and sales expenses to increase. In addition, we would not be able to use www.marriott.com and www.ritzcarlton.com as channels through which to rent available inventory, which would cause our rental revenue to decline.\nThe Marriott Rewards Agreement would also terminate upon termination of the License Agreements, and we would not be able to offer Marriott Rewards points to owners and potential owners, which would impair our ability to sell our products and would reduce the flexibility and options available in connection with our products.\nIn September 2016, Marriott International completed its acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., following which Marriott International announced that it had begun permitting Marriott Rewards members to link their Marriott Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest accounts and to transfer points between the two programs. In February 2018, in connection with Marriott International\u2019s goals of creating a single loyalty program as well as integrating its website, reservation systems, call center and other programs with those it acquired in the Starwood transaction, we and Marriott International entered into amendments to the License Agreements and certain other agreements. Pursuant to these amendments, in exchange for agreeing to a limited exception to our exclusive rights with respect to access to the Marriott Rewards program and member lists and Marriott International\u2019s reservation system and marriott.com website, we received a number of benefits, including a reduction in our annual royalty fee, increased annual co-marketing funds associated with Marriott International\u2019s new credit card arrangements and reduced costs of Marriott Rewards points under our existing agreements with Marriott International resulting from planned system-wide reductions in the rates Marriott International charges its loyalty program partners, and certain expanded marketing rights. We cannot assure you that any benefits we expect from these amendments will be realized, or that they will be realized as or when expected.\nIf Marriott International or The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company terminates our rights to use the Marriott or Ritz-Carlton marks at any properties that do not meet applicable brand standards, our reputation could be harmed and our ability to market and sell our products at those properties could be impaired.\nMarriott International and The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company can terminate our rights under the License Agreements to use the Marriott or Ritz-Carlton marks at any properties that do not meet applicable brand standards. The termination of such rights could harm our reputation and impair our ability to market and sell our products at the subject properties, either of which could harm our business, and we could be subject to claims by Marriott International and The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, property owners, third parties with whom we have contracted and others.\nOur ability to expand our business and remain competitive could be harmed if Marriott International or The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company do not consent to our use of their trademarks at new resorts we acquire or develop in the future.\nUnder the terms of our License Agreements with Marriott International and The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, we must obtain Marriott International\u2019s or The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company\u2019s consent, as applicable, to use the Marriott or Ritz-Carlton trademarks in connection with resorts, residences or other accommodations that we acquire or develop in the future. Marriott International or The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company may reject a proposed project if, among other things, the project does not meet Marriott International\u2019s or The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company\u2019s respective construction and design standards or Marriott International or The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company reasonably believes the project will breach contractual or legal restrictions applicable to them and their affiliates. In addition, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company may reject a proposed project if The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company will not be able to provide services that comply with Ritz-Carlton brand standards at the proposed project. If Marriott International or The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company do not permit us to use their trademarks in connection with our development or acquisition plans, our ability to expand our Marriott and Ritz-Carlton businesses and remain competitive may be materially adversely affected. The requirement to obtain Marriott International\u2019s or The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company\u2019s consent to our expansion plans, or the need to identify and secure alternative expansion opportunities\nbecause Marriott International or The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company do not allow us to use their trademarks with proposed new projects, may delay implementation of our expansion plans and cause us to incur additional expense.\nOur business depends on the quality and reputation of the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton brands, and any deterioration in the quality or reputation of these brands could have an adverse impact on our market share, reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCurrently, our products and services are predominantly offered under Marriott or Ritz-Carlton brand names, and we intend to continue to offer products and services under these brands in the future. If the quality of these brands deteriorates, or the reputation of these brands declines, our market share, reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIf a Marriott International or Ritz-Carlton hotel property with which one of our resorts is co-located ceases to be operated by Marriott International or The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company or one of their affiliates, our business could be harmed.\nNearly one-third of our vacation ownership resorts are co-located with Marriott International and Ritz-Carlton hotel properties. If a Marriott International or Ritz-Carlton branded hotel property with which one of our resorts is co-located ceases to be operated by Marriott International or The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company or one of their affiliates, we could lose the benefits derived from co-location of our resorts, such as the sharing of amenities, infrastructure and staff, integration of services, and other cost efficiencies. Our owners could lose access to the more varied and elaborate amenities that are generally available at the larger campus of an integrated vacation ownership and hotel resort. We expect our overhead and operating costs for resorts that are no longer co-located with a Marriott International or Ritz-Carlton hotel property would increase. We would also lose our on-site access to hotel customers, including Marriott Rewards customer loyalty program members, at such resorts, which is a cost-effective marketing channel for our vacation ownership products, and our sales may decline.\nIf we are not able to maintain relationships with third parties that support our marketing activities, our business could be harmed.\nMany of our marketing activities require us to maintain relationships with third parties. For example, we market to existing Marriott Rewards customer loyalty program members and travelers who are staying in locations where we have resorts. We also market extensively to guests in Marriott International hotels that are located near one of our sales locations and have marketing partnerships with North American Marriott reservation centers. In addition, we operate other local marketing venues in various high-traffic areas. If we are not able to maintain these marketing arrangements with these third parties on terms that are favorable to us or at all, our sales may decline, which could adversely affect our financial conditions and result of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by factors that disrupt or deter travel.\nThe profitability of the vacation ownership resorts that we develop and manage may be adversely affected by a number of factors that can disrupt or deter travel. A substantial amount of our sales activity occurs at our resorts, and sales volume is impacted by the number of prospective owners who visit our resorts. Fear of exposure to contagious and other diseases, such as Ebola virus, H1N1 Flu, Avian Flu, the Zika virus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or natural or man-made disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, fires, volcanic eruptions, sinkholes, radiation releases, gas leaks and oil spills, may deter travelers from scheduling sales tours at our resorts or cause them to cancel travel plans. Damage to infrastructure, whether caused by natural or man-made disasters or other causes, that impedes travel may cause travelers to delay or cancel plans to tour or visit our resorts. Actual or threatened war, civil unrest and terrorist activity, as well as heightened travel security measures instituted in response to the same, could also interrupt or deter travel plans. In addition, demand for vacation options such as our vacation ownership products may decrease if the cost of travel, including the cost of transportation and fuel, increases or if general economic conditions decline. Changes in the desirability of the locations where we develop and manage resorts as vacation destinations and changes in vacation and travel patterns may adversely affect our cash flows, revenue and profits.\nThird-party reservation channels may negatively affect our rental revenues.\nSome of our rental customers book their stays at our resorts through third-party internet travel intermediaries, such as expedia.com, orbitz.com and booking.com, as well as lesser-known and newly emerging online travel service providers. If the percentage of bookings through these intermediaries increases, they may be able to obtain higher commissions, reduced room rates or other significant contract concessions from us. Moreover, some of these internet travel intermediaries are attempting to commoditize lodging by increasing the importance of price and general indicators of quality (such as \u201cthree-star property\u201d) at the expense of brand identification. These intermediaries also generally employ aggressive marketing strategies, including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites. Additionally, consumers can book stays at our resorts through other distribution channels, including travel agents, travel membership associations and meeting procurement firms. Over time, consumers may develop loyalties to these third-party\nreservation systems rather than to our booking channels. Although we expect to derive most of our business from traditional channels and our websites (and those of Marriott International and the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company), our business and profitability could be adversely affected if customer loyalties change significantly, diverting bookings away from our resorts.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation, and any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is heavily regulated. We are subject to a wide variety of complex international, national, federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies in jurisdictions around the world. Some laws, regulations and policies impact multiple areas of our business, such as securities, anti-discrimination, anti-fraud, data protection and security and anti-corruption and bribery laws and regulations or government economic sanctions, including applicable regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control and the FCPA. Other laws, regulations and policies primarily affect one of four areas of our business: real estate development activities; marketing and sales activities; lending activities; and resort management activities. For more information regarding laws, regulations and policies to which we are subject, see \u201cBusiness-Regulation.\u201d\nWe may not be successful in maintaining compliance with all laws, regulations and policies to which we are currently subject, and the cost of compliance with such laws, regulations and policies could be significant. The laws, regulations and policies to which we are subject may change or be subject to different interpretation in the future, including in ways that could negatively impact our business. Failure to comply with current or future applicable laws, regulations and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, if we do not comply with applicable laws, governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where the violations occurred may revoke or refuse to renew licenses or registrations we must have in order to operate our business. In addition, Europe\u2019s new GDPR, which will become effective in May 2018, extends the jurisdictional scope of European data protection law and imposes additional data protection requirements; potential penalties for non-compliance with the GDPR include administrative fines of up to 4 percent of our annual worldwide turnover. Failure to comply with applicable laws could also render sales contracts for our products void or voidable, subject us to fines or other sanctions and increase our exposure to litigation, including claims against us by individuals alleging our failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies to which we are subject. Adverse action by governmental authorities alleging our failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies, or litigation by individuals alleging such failures, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and reputation.\nChanges in tax regulations or their interpretation could reduce our profits or increase our costs.\nJurisdictions in which we do business may at any time review tax and other revenue raising laws, regulations and policies, and any resulting changes could impose new restrictions, costs or prohibitions on our current practices and reduce our profits. In particular, governments may revise tax laws, regulations or official interpretations in ways that could have a significant impact on us, including modifications that could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our non-U.S. operations, or that could require costly changes to those operations, or the way that we structure them. For example, the effective tax rates of most U.S. corporations reflect the fact that income earned and reinvested outside the United States is generally taxed at local rates, which are often much lower than U.S. tax rates. In addition, interpretation of tax regulations requires us to exercise our judgment and taxing authorities or our independent registered public accounting firm may reach conclusions about the application of such regulations that differ from our conclusions. If changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations were to significantly increase the tax rates on non-U.S. income, our effective tax rate could increase, our profits could be reduced, and if such increases were a result of our status as a U.S. corporation, we could be placed at a disadvantage to our non-U.S. competitors if those competitors remain subject to lower local tax rates.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law H.R. 1, originally known as the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d which significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The new legislation, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, and shifts from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation in which U.S. companies are taxed on their global income to a territorial system in which U.S. companies are only taxed on income earned in the United States. Many aspects of the new legislation are unclear and may not be clarified for some time. We continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business, but have not yet been able to determine the full impact of the new laws on our business, operations or financial condition. The impact of certain provisions of this tax reform on our financial condition and results of operations could be adverse and such impact could be material.\nChanges in privacy laws could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively.\nWe rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including telemarketing, email marketing and postal mailings. Adoption of new state or federal laws regulating marketing and solicitation, or international data protection laws that govern these activities, or changes to existing laws, such as the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the CANSPAM Act and the GDPR, could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of telemarketing, email and postal mailing techniques and could force us to make further changes in our marketing strategy. If this occurs, we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing\nstrategies, which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of vacation ownership interests and other products. We also obtain access to potential customers from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have relationships and market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other companies\u2019 marketing materials. If access to these lists was prohibited or otherwise restricted, our ability to develop new customers and introduce our products to them could be impaired.\nOur points-based product form exposes us to an increased risk of temporary inventory depletion.\nSelling vacation ownership interests in a system of resorts under a points-based business model increases the risk of temporary inventory depletion. The primary source of inventory in our North America and Asia Pacific segments is concentrated in a small number of trust entities that issue vacation ownership interests denominated in points. In contrast, under our prior business model, we sold weeks-based vacation ownership interests tied to specific resorts; we thus had more sources of inventory (i.e., resorts), and the risk of inventory depletion was diffused among those sources of inventory.\nTemporary depletion of inventory available for sale can be caused by three primary factors: (1) delayed delivery of inventory under construction by us or third parties; (2) delayed receipt of required governmental registrations of inventory for sale; and (3) significant unanticipated increases in sales pace. If the inventory available for sale for a particular trust were to be depleted before new inventory is added and available for sale, we would be required to temporarily suspend sales until inventory is replenished. While we seek to avoid the risk of temporary inventory depletion by maintaining a surplus supply of completed inventory based on our forecasted sales pace, as well as by employing other mitigation strategies such as accelerating completion of resorts under construction, acquiring vacation ownership interests on the secondary market, or reducing sales pace by adjusting prices or sales incentives, any temporary suspension of sales due to lack of inventory could reduce our cash flow and have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur development activities expose us to project cost and completion risks.\nOur ongoing development of new vacation ownership properties and new phases of existing vacation ownership properties presents a number of risks. Our profits may be adversely affected if construction costs escalate faster than the pace at which we can increase the price of vacation ownership interests. Construction delays, zoning and other local approvals, cost overruns, lender financial defaults, or natural or man-made disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, fires, volcanic eruptions, radiation releases and oil spills, may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations. In addition, any liability or alleged liability associated with latent defects in projects we have constructed or that we construct in the future may adversely affect our business, financial condition and reputation.\nThe maintenance and refurbishment of vacation ownership properties depends on maintenance fees paid by the owners of vacation ownership interests.\nThe maintenance fees that are levied on owners of our vacation ownership interests by property owners\u2019 association boards are used to maintain and refurbish the vacation ownership properties and to keep the properties in compliance with Marriott and Ritz-Carlton brand standards. Property owners\u2019 association boards may not levy sufficient maintenance fees, or owners of vacation ownership interests may fail to pay their maintenance fees for reasons such as financial hardship or because of damage to their vacation ownership interests from natural disasters such as hurricanes. In these circumstances, not only could our management fee revenue be adversely affected, but the vacation ownership properties could fall into disrepair and fail to comply with applicable brand standards. If a resort fails to comply with applicable brand standards, Marriott International or The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company could terminate our rights under the applicable License Agreement to use its trademarks at the non-compliant resort, which would result in the loss of management fees, decrease customer satisfaction and impair our ability to market and sell our products at the non-compliant locations.\nIf maintenance fees at our resorts are required to be increased, our products could become less attractive and our business could be harmed.\nThe maintenance fees that are levied on owners of our vacation ownership interests by property owners\u2019 association boards may increase as the costs to maintain and refurbish the vacation ownership properties and to keep the properties in compliance with Marriott and Ritz-Carlton brand standards increase. Increased maintenance fees could make our products less desirable, which could have a negative impact on sales of our products and could also cause an increase in defaults with respect to our vacation ownership notes receivable portfolio.\nDisagreements with the owners of vacation ownership interests and property owners\u2019 associations may result in litigation and the loss of management contracts.\nThe nature of our relationships with our owners and our responsibilities in managing our vacation ownership properties will from time to time give rise to disagreements with the owners of vacation ownership interests and property owners\u2019 associations. Owners of our vacation ownership interests may also disagree with changes we make to our products or programs. We seek to expeditiously resolve any disagreements in order to develop and maintain positive relations with current\nand potential owners and property owners\u2019 associations, but cannot always do so. Failure to resolve such disagreements has resulted in litigation, and could do so again in the future. If any such litigation results in a significant adverse judgment, settlement or court order, we could suffer significant losses, our profits could be reduced, our reputation could be harmed and our future ability to operate our business could be constrained. Disagreements with property owners\u2019 associations have in the past and could in the future result in the loss of management contracts.\nThe expiration, termination or renegotiation of our management contracts could adversely affect our cash flows, revenues and profits.\nWe enter into a management agreement with the property owners\u2019 association or other governing body at each of our resorts and, when a trust holds interests in resorts, with the trust\u2019s governing body. The management fee is typically based on either a percentage of the budgeted costs to operate such resorts or a fixed fee arrangement. We also receive revenues that represent reimbursement for certain costs we incur under our management agreements, principally payroll-related costs at the locations where we employ the associates providing on-site services. The terms of our management agreements typically range from three to ten years and are generally subject to periodic renewal for one to five year terms. Many of these agreements renew automatically unless either party provides notice of termination before the expiration of the term. Any of these management contracts may expire at the end of its then-current term (following notice by a party of non-renewal) or be terminated, or the contract terms may be renegotiated in a manner adverse to us. Upon non-renewal or termination of our management agreement for a particular resort, the resort ceases to be part of our system and we lose the management fee revenue associated with the resort. If a management agreement is terminated or not renewed on favorable terms, our cash flows, revenues and profits could be adversely affected.\nSome of our resorts and sales centers are concentrated in particular geographic areas, which exposes our business to the effects of regional events and occurrences in these areas.\nApproximately 43 percent of our resorts and 20 percent of our sales centers are concentrated in Florida, South Carolina and Hawaii and, therefore, our business is particularly susceptible to the effects of natural or manmade disasters in these areas, including earthquakes, windstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, floods, drought, fires, oil spills and nuclear incidents. Depending on the severity of these disasters, the resulting damage could require closure of all or substantially all of our properties in one or more of these markets for a period of time necessary to complete repairs and renovations. We cannot guarantee that the amount of insurance maintained for these properties would cover all damages caused by any such an event, including the loss of sales at sales centers that are not fully operational. Our business is also particularly susceptible to the effects of adverse economic developments in these areas, such as regional economic downturns, significant increases in the number of our competitors\u2019 products in these markets and potentially higher labor, real estate, tax or other costs in the geographic markets in which we are concentrated. As a result of this geographic concentration of properties, we face a greater risk of a negative effect on our revenues in the event these areas are affected by extreme weather, manmade disasters or adverse economic and competitive conditions.\nDamage to, or other potential losses involving, properties that we own or manage may not be covered by insurance.\nMarket forces beyond our control may limit the scope of the insurance coverage we can obtain or our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates. Certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, or terrorist acts, may be uninsurable or the price of coverage for such losses may be too expensive to justify obtaining insurance. As a result, the cost of our insurance may increase and our coverage levels may decrease. In addition, in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of our lost investment or that of owners of vacation ownership interests or in some cases may not provide a recovery for any part of a loss due to deductible limits, policy limits, coverage limits or other factors. As a result, we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, and we could remain obligated under guarantees or other financial obligations related to the property.\nOur pursuit of new business opportunities to grow our business may not be successful.\nOne of our strategic initiatives is to selectively pursue new business opportunities, such as the continued enhancement of our exchange programs, new management affiliations and acquisitions of existing vacation ownership and related businesses. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in connection with opportunities in locations where the markets for vacation ownership products are not fully developed. We may invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new businesses. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new businesses may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of new businesses. Furthermore, any new business could strain our system of internal controls and diminish its effectiveness. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur share repurchase program may not enhance long-term stockholder value, and could increase the volatility of the market price of our common stock and diminish our cash reserves.\nThe share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount, or to acquire any specific number, of shares of our common stock. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market conditions, business conditions, statutory and contractual restrictions, the trading price of our common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities available to us. The repurchase program may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. In addition, repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth, pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions, and discharge liabilities. Our share repurchases may not enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the prices at which we repurchased shares of stock and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.\nOur ability to pay dividends on our stock is limited.\nWe intend to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our stockholders. However, we may not declare or pay such dividends in the future at the prior rate or at all. All decisions regarding our payment of dividends will be made by our Board of Directors from time to time and will be subject to an evaluation of our financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements, as well as applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice, contractual restraints and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant. In addition, our Revolving Corporate Credit Facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, and the terms of agreements governing debt that we may incur in the future may also limit or prohibit dividend payments. The payment of certain cash dividends may also result in an adjustment to the conversion rate of the Convertible Notes in a manner adverse to us. We may not have sufficient surplus under Delaware law to be able to pay any dividends, which may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures or increases in reserves.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock has a limited trading history. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;\n\u2022\nsuccess or failure of our business strategy;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant new business developments or significant acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles, including a new standard regarding revenue recognition that we adopted in the first quarter of 2018;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to continue to cover our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of our company and the vacation ownership industry;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations;\n\u2022\ninitiation of or developments in legal proceedings;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nThe growth of our business and the execution of our business strategies depend on the services of our senior management and our associates.\nWe believe that our future growth depends, in part, on the continued services of our senior management team, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, Stephen P. Weisz, and on our ability to successfully implement succession plans for members of our senior management team. The loss of any members of our senior management team, or the failure to identify successors for such positions, could adversely affect our strategic and customer relationships and impede our ability to execute our business strategies.\nIn addition, insufficient numbers of talented associates could constrain our ability to maintain and expand our business. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel. If we cannot recruit, train, develop or retain sufficient numbers of talented associates, we could experience increased associate turnover, decreased guest satisfaction, low morale, inefficiency or internal control failures.\nIf we identify additional excess land and inventory in the future, or if our estimates of the fair value of our excess land and inventory change, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSince the Spin-Off, we have identified excess land and inventory and have disposed of a significant portion of the land and inventory we identified. We may also conclude in the future that additional land and inventory are excess, in which case we would likely terminate plans to develop such land and instead seek to dispose of such excess land and inventory through bulk sales or other methods. If we identify additional excess land and inventory in the future, we may have to record additional non-cash impairment charges to write-down the value of such assets. Any such impairment charges may have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, if real estate market conditions change, our estimates of the fair value of our excess land and inventory may change. If our estimates of the fair value of these assets decline, we may have to record additional non-cash impairment charges to write-down the value of such assets to the estimated fair value. Any such impairment charges may have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur use of different estimates and assumptions in the application of our accounting policies could result in material changes to our reported financial condition and results of operations, and changes in accounting standards or their interpretation could significantly impact our reported results of operations.\nOur accounting policies are critical to the manner in which we present our results of operations and financial condition. Many of these policies, including policies relating to the recognition of revenue and determination of cost of sales, are highly complex and involve many assumptions, estimates and judgments. We are required to review these assumptions, estimates and judgments regularly and revise them when necessary. Our actual results of operations vary from period to period based on revisions to these estimates. In addition, the regulatory bodies that establish accounting and reporting standards, including the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, periodically revise or issue new financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Changes to these standards or their interpretation could significantly impact our reported results in future periods. See Footnote No. 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to our Financial Statements for more information regarding changes in accounting standards that we recently adopted or expect to adopt in the future.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nAlthough holders of the Convertible Notes are generally not permitted to convert the Convertible Notes until June 15, 2022, in the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered due to the trading price of the Convertible Notes or our common stock, holders of the Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. See Footnote No. 10, \u201cDebt,\u201d to our Financial Statements for additional information. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we may elect to settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes or to repurchase the Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change.\nUpon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes with respect to our company, holders of the Convertible Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes at a purchase price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the repurchase date. In addition, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Convertible Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchases of Convertible Notes surrendered therefor or Convertible Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Convertible Notes may be limited by the agreements governing our existing indebtedness (including the credit agreement governing the Revolving Corporate Credit Facility) and may also be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements that will govern\nour future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Convertible Notes at a time when the repurchase is required or to pay cash payable on future conversions of the Convertible Notes as required would constitute a default under the Convertible Notes. Such a default or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness (including the Revolving Corporate Credit Facility). If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Convertible Notes, may have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\u201cASC 470-20\u201d), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Convertible Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component has been treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Convertible Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Convertible Notes to their face amount over the term of the Convertible Notes. We will report lower net income (or greater net loss) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the Convertible Notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method if we have the ability and intent to settle in cash, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Convertible Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to demonstrate the ability or intent to settle in cash or that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nThe Convertible Note Hedges and Warrants may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedges (the \u201cConvertible Note Hedges\u201d) with affiliates of two of the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Note Hedges cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Convertible Notes, the same number of shares of common stock that initially underlay the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Note Hedges are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to our common stock and/or offset cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount, in each case, upon any conversion of Convertible Notes. Concurrently with our entry into the Convertible Note Hedges, we entered into warrant transactions (the \u201cWarrants\u201d) with the hedge counterparties relating to the same number of shares of common stock. The Warrants could separately have a dilutive effect on our shares of common stock to the extent that the market price per share exceeds the applicable strike price of the Warrants on one or more of the applicable expiration dates.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedges of the Convertible Note Hedges and the Warrants, the hedge counterparties and/or their respective affiliates advised us that they expected to purchase shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes. The hedge counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market. The effect, if any, of these activities on the market price of our common stock or the Convertible Notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could cause or prevent an increase or a decline in the market price of our common stock or the Convertible Notes.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the Convertible Note Hedges.\nThe counterparties to the Convertible Note Hedges are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that one or more of the hedge counterparties may default under the Convertible Note Hedges. Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties is not secured by any collateral. If any of the hedge counterparties become subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions\nwith such counterparties. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by a hedge counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the hedge counterparties.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law and in certain agreements to which we are party could delay or prevent a change in control.\nProvisions of our Charter and Bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. For example, our Charter and Bylaws provide for a classified board, require advance notice for shareholder proposals and nominations, place limitations on convening shareholder meetings and authorize our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. In addition, Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock and us.\nIn addition, provisions in our agreements with Marriott International may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. Under the Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement, we agreed not to enter into any transaction involving an acquisition or issuance of our common stock or any other transaction (or, to the extent we have the right to prohibit it, to permit any such transaction) that could reasonably be expected to cause the distribution of our common stock to be taxable to Marriott International. We are required to indemnify Marriott International for any tax resulting from any such prohibited transaction, and we are required to meet various requirements, including obtaining the approval of Marriott International or obtaining an Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) ruling or unqualified opinion of tax counsel acceptable to Marriott International, before engaging in such transactions. Further, our License Agreements with Marriott International and The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company provide that a change in control may not occur without the consent of Marriott International or The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, respectively. A change in control for purposes of these agreements would occur if, among other things, a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of, or the power to exercise effective control over, shares of our common stock representing more than 15 percent of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in elections of directors.\nFurther, the terms of the Convertible Notes require us to repurchase the Convertible Notes in the event of certain fundamental changes with respect to our company. A takeover of our company would trigger an option of the holders of the Convertible Notes to require us to repurchase the Convertible Notes. This may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to holders of our common stock and holders of the Convertible Notes.\nThe Spin-Off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of our contractual arrangements with Marriott International.\nPursuant to a Separation and Distribution Agreement that we entered into with Marriott International in connection with the Spin-Off, from and after the Spin-Off, each of us and Marriott International is responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses it owns and operates following the consummation of the Spin-Off. Although we do not expect to be liable for any obligations that were not allocated to us under such agreement, a court could disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Marriott International (for example, tax and/or environmental liabilities), particularly if Marriott International were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the allocated obligations.\nCertain of our executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their ownership of Marriott International equity or their former positions with Marriott International.\nCertain of our executive officers and directors are former officers and employees of Marriott International and thus have professional relationships with Marriott International\u2019s executive officers and directors. In addition, many of our executive officers and directors have financial interests in Marriott International that are substantial to them as a result of their ownership of Marriott International stock, options and other equity awards. These relationships and personal financial interests may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers face decisions that could have different implications for Marriott International than for us.", "PERMNO": 13085, "SIC": 7011, "TIC": "VAC"}
