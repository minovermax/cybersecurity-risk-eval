For example, a significant portion of the communications between the Company\u2019s personnel, customers, and suppliers depends on information technology. Our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond our control including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, and other security issues. We have technology and information security processes and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate our risk to these vulnerabilities. However, these measures may not be adequate to ensure that our operations will not be disrupted, should such an event occur.\nThe Company's dependency on the microelectronics industry, which as a whole is volatile, could have a negative material impact on its business.\nThe Company sells substantially all of its photomasks to semiconductor or flat panel display designers, manufacturers and foundries, as well as to other high performance electronics manufacturers. We believe that the demand for photomasks depends primarily on design activity rather than sales volume from products using photomask technologies. Consequently, an increase in semiconductor or FPD sales does not necessarily result in a corresponding increase in photomask sales. In addition, the reduced use of customized ICs, a reduction in design complexity, other changes in the technology or methods of manufacturing or designing semiconductors or FPDs, or a slowdown in the introduction of new semiconductor or FPD designs could reduce demand for photomasks - even if the demand for semiconductors and FPDs increases. Historically, the semiconductor industry has been volatile, with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns. These downturns have been characterized by, among other things, diminished product demand, excess production capacity and accelerated erosion of selling prices.\nThe Company's results may suffer if the IC or FPD photomask market does not grow or if the Company is unable to serve these markets successfully. We believe that the demand for photomasks for both ICs and FPDs depends primarily on design activity and, to a lesser extent, upon an increase in the number of production facilities used to manufacture ICs or FPDs. As a result, an increase in IC or FPD sales will not necessarily lead to a corresponding increase in photomask sales. However, a slowdown in the development of new technologies for fabricating ICs or FPDs could reduce the demand for related photomasks.\nThe Company may incur future net losses.\nAlthough the Company has been profitable since fiscal 2010, it has, in the past, incurred net losses. The net losses experienced in prior years were due, in part, to macroeconomic factors, which resulted in the Company incurring significant charges for restructurings and impairments of long-lived assets. The Company cannot provide assurance that it will not incur net losses in the future.\nThe Company's quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly and may continue to do so in the future.\nThe Company has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly operating results and anticipates that such fluctuations will continue and could intensify in the future. Fluctuations in operating results may result in volatility in the prices of the Company's common stock and financial instruments linked to the value of the Company's common stock. Operating results may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including the size and timing of orders and shipments, the loss of significant customers, changes in product mix, the flow of customer design releases, technological change, fluctuations in manufacturing yields, competition and general economic conditions. We operate in a high fixed cost environment and, should our revenues and asset utilization decrease, our operating margins could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company's customers generally order photomasks on an as-needed basis, and our net sales in any quarter are dependent on orders received during that quarter. Since we operate with little backlog and the rate of new orders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, our capital expenditures and, to some extent, expense levels are based primarily on sales forecasts and technological advancements in photomask manufacturing equipment. Consequently, if anticipated sales in any quarter do not occur when expected, capital expenditures could be higher than needed, resulting in underutilized capacity and disproportionately high expense levels, causing operating results to be adversely affected. Due to the foregoing factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. In addition, in future quarters, our operating results could be below guidance provided by the Company and the expectations of public market analysts and investors which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company's common stock.\nThe photomask industry is subject to rapid technological change and the Company might fail to remain competitive, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations.\nThe photomask industry has been, and is expected to continue to be, characterized by technological change and evolving industry standards. In order to remain competitive, the Company will be required to continually anticipate, respond to and utilize changing technologies of increasing complexity in both traditional and emerging markets that it serves. In particular, we believe that, as semiconductor geometries continue to become smaller and FPDs become larger with improved performance, we will be required to manufacture increasingly complex photomasks. Additionally, the demand for photomasks has been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by changes in semiconductor and high performance electronics fabrication methods that affect the type or quantity of photomasks utilized, such as changes in semiconductor demand that favor field programmable gate arrays and other semiconductor designs that replace application-specific ICs. Furthermore, evidence of the viability and the corresponding market acceptance of alternative methods of transferring IC designs onto semiconductor wafers could reduce or eliminate the need for photomasks in the production of semiconductors. As of the end of fiscal 2016, one alternative method, direct-write lithography, has not been proven to be a commercially viable alternative to photomasks, as it is considered to be too slow for high volume semiconductor wafer production. However, should direct-write or any other alternative method of transferring IC or FPD designs without the use of photomasks achieve market acceptance, and if the Company is unable to anticipate, respond to or utilize these or other technological changes, due to resource, technological or other constraints, its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company's operations will continue to require substantial capital expenditures, for which it may be unable to obtain funding.\nThe manufacture of photomasks requires substantial investments by the Company in high-end manufacturing capability. We expect that we will be required to continue to make substantial capital expenditures to meet the technological demands of our customers and to position us for future growth. The Company's capital expenditure payments for fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately $100 million, of which $9 million was included in accounts payable on its October 30, 2016, Consolidated Balance Sheet. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain\nthe additional capital required to fund our operations on reasonable terms, if at all, or that any such inability will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe Company has been dependent on sales to a limited number of large customers; the loss of any of these customers or a significant reduction in orders from these customers could have a material adverse effect on its sales and results of operations.\nHistorically, the Company has sold a significant proportion of photomasks to a limited number of IC and FPD manufacturers. During fiscal years 2016 and 2015 our two largest customers accounted for 36% and 33%, respectively, of our net sales. The Company's five largest customers accounted for 50%, 52% and 44% of net sales in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. None of the Company's customers have entered into significant long-term agreements with the Company requiring them to purchase the Company's products. The loss of a significant customer or a significant reduction or delay in orders from any significant customer, (including reductions or delays due to customer departures from recent buying patterns), or an unfavorable change in competitive conditions in the semiconductor or FPD industries, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance and business prospects. The consolidation of semiconductor manufacturers or an economic downturn in the semiconductor industry may increase the likelihood of losing a significant customer and could also have an adverse effect on the Company's financial performance and business prospects.\nThe Company depends on a limited number of suppliers for equipment and raw materials and, if those suppliers do not deliver their products to the Company, it may be unable to fulfill orders from its customers, which could adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nThe Company relies on a limited number of photomask equipment manufacturers to develop and supply the equipment it uses. These equipment manufacturers currently require lead times of up to twelve months or longer between the order and the delivery of certain photomask imaging and inspection equipment. The failure of such manufacturers to develop or deliver such equipment on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations. In addition, the manufacturing equipment necessary to produce advanced photomasks could become prohibitively expensive, which could similarly affect the Company.\nThe Company uses high precision quartz photomask blanks, pellicles, and electronic grade chemicals in its manufacturing processes. There are a limited number of suppliers of these raw materials and the Company has no long-term contracts with these suppliers. Any delays or quality problems in connection with significant raw materials, particularly photomask blanks, could cause delays in the shipments of photomasks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates, with respect to prices of equipment and raw materials used in manufacturing, could also have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations.\nThe Company faces risks associated with the use of sophisticated equipment and complex manufacturing processes and technologies. Our inability to effectively utilize such equipment and technologies and perform such processes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe Company's complex manufacturing processes require the use of expensive and technologically sophisticated equipment and materials, and are continually modified in an effort to improve manufacturing yields and product quality. Minute impurities, defects or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower manufacturing yields and make products unmarketable. Moreover, manufacturing leading-edge photomasks is more complex and time consuming than manufacturing less advanced photomasks, and may lead to delays in the manufacturing of all levels of photomasks. The Company has, on occasion, experienced manufacturing difficulties and capacity limitations that have delayed its ability to deliver products within the time frames contracted for by its customers. The Company cannot provide assurance that, under such circumstances, it will not experience these or other manufacturing difficulties, or be subject to increased costs or production capacity constraints in the future, any of which could result in a loss of customers or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications.\nOur products provide important performance attributes to our customers\u2019 products. If a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed, a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform, particularly if such products are sold under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees. Our customers often require us to represent that our products conform to certain product specifications provided by our customers. Any failure to comply with such specifications could result in claims or legal action. A successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers.\nThe Company's debt agreements limit its ability to obtain additional financing and may obligate it to repay debt before its maturity.\nFinancial covenants related to the Company\u2019s credit facility, which was last amended in August 2014, include Total Leverage Ratio, a Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio, and Minimum Unrestricted Cash Balances. Existing covenant restrictions limit the Company's ability to obtain additional debt financing and, should Photronics be unable to meet one or more of these covenants, its lenders may require it to repay any outstanding balance prior to the expiration date of the agreements. Our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants in our debt agreements may be affected by worsening economic or business conditions, or other events. The Company cannot assure that, under such circumstances, additional sources of financing would be available to pay off any long-term borrowings, so as to avoid default. Should we default on certain of our long-term borrowings, a cross default would occur on other long-term borrowings, unless amended or waived.\nAcquisitions, divestitures, mergers, business combinations or joint ventures by the Company may entail certain operational and financial risks.\nThe Company has made significant acquisitions throughout its history and it may make other acquisitions or participate in other divestitures, joint ventures, business combinations or mergers in the future. On April 4, 2014, DNP Photomask Technology Taiwan Co., Ltd. (\u201cDPTT\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd. (\u201cDNP\u201d), merged into Photronics Semiconductor Mask Corporation (\u201cPSMC\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of Photronics, to form PDMC. As a result of the acquisition of DPTT, Photronics and DNP own 50.01 percent and 49.99 percent of PDMC, respectively. After the completion of such an acquisition the Company may be subject to various risks which could adversely affect its future earnings and cash flows. These may include risks such as: the cost of combining the operations of the acquired company with the Company\u2019s operations may exceed our estimates; goodwill, if any, or other intangible assets recognized may be subject to impairment charges; the lives of intangible assets acquired may be reduced; contingent liabilities are identified or change; the unanticipated loss of sales due to an overlap of customers served by the Company and the acquiree occurs; and that greater than anticipated charges to maintain duplicate pre-merger activities and eliminate duplicative activities are experienced. Furthermore, the Company may need to utilize its cash reserves and/or issue new securities to fund future acquisitions, which could have a dilutive effect on its earnings per share. In cases of acquisitions that require the Company to estimate the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, such estimates, though based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, are subject to uncertainty.\nJoint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations, which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures.\nThe nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties. If our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations, the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan. In that case, our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture. Also, differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues. If these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate acquisitions into our business, which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses.\nAs part of our business growth strategy, we have acquired businesses, assets from businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future. Our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources, including available cash and borrowing capacity. The expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures, the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully, could result in unanticipated expenses and losses. Furthermore, we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures.\nThe process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations. Some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include: potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; unforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures; unforeseen adjustments, taxes, charges and write-offs; problems enforcing the indemnification obligations of sellers of businesses or joint venture partners for claims and liabilities; unexpected losses of customers of, or suppliers to, the acquired business; difficulty in conforming the acquired businesses\u2019 standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations; variability in financial information arising from the implementation of purchase price accounting; inability to coordinate new product and process development; loss of senior managers and other critical personnel and problems with new labor unions; and challenges arising from the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.\nThe Company\u2019s announced expansion into China entails substantial risks.\nIn August 2016 the Company announced that it would invest $160 million, in the form of a combination of cash and transferred capital, over the next five years to construct an IC research and development and manufacturing facility in Xiamen, China. This investment is subject to substantial risks which may include, but are not limited to: delays in or the inability to obtain necessary permits that are needed to enable us to construct our facility or conduct our ongoing business; the inability to protect our intellectual property rights under Chinese law, which may not offer as high of a level of protection as U.S. law; unexpectedly long negotiation periods with Chinese suppliers and customers; quality issues related to materials sourced from local vendors; unexpectedly high labor costs due to a tight labor supply; and difficulty in repatriating funds and selling or transferring assets. Our investment in China also exposes us to a significant additional foreign currency exchange risk, which we have not been subject to in recent years. These and other risks may result in our not realizing a return on, or losing some of or all of our planned investment in China, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and financial performance.\nThe Company's cash flows from operations and current holdings of cash may not be adequate for its current and long-term needs.\nThe Company's liquidity, as it operates in a high fixed cost environment, is highly dependent on its sales volume and the timing of its capital expenditures, which can vary significantly from period to period. Depending on conditions in the semiconductor and FPD markets, the Company's cash flows from operations and current holdings of cash may not be adequate to meet its current and long-term needs for capital expenditures, operations and debt repayments. Historically, in certain years, the Company has used external financing to fund these needs. Due to conditions in the credit markets and covenant restrictions on its existing debt, some financing instruments used by the Company in the past may not be available to it. Therefore, the Company cannot provide assurance that additional sources of financing would be available to it on commercially favorable terms, if at all, should its cash requirements exceed its cash available from operations, existing cash, and cash available under its credit facility.\nThe Company may incur unforeseen charges related to possible future facility closures or restructurings.\nThe Company cannot provide assurance that there will not be facility closures or restructurings in the near or long-term, nor can it assure that it will not incur significant charges should there be any future facility closures or restructurings.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive environment and, should it be unable to meet its customers\u2019 requirements for product quality, timeliness of delivery or technical capabilities, its sales could be adversely affected.\nThe photomask industry is highly competitive, and most of the Company's customers utilize more than one photomask supplier. The Company's competitors include Compugraphics International, Ltd., DNP (outside of Taiwan), Hoya Corporation, SK-Electronics Co., Ltd., Taiwan Mask Corporation and Toppan Printing Co., Ltd. The Company also competes with semiconductor manufacturers' captive photomask manufacturing operations, some of which market their photomask manufacturing services to outside customers. We expect to face continued competition from these and other suppliers in the future. Some of the Company's competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing or other resources than it has. Also, when producing smaller geometry photomasks, some of our competitors may be able to more rapidly develop, produce, and achieve higher manufacturing yields than us. The Company believes that consistency of product quality and timeliness of delivery, as well as price, technical capability, and service are the principal factors considered by customers in selecting their photomask suppliers. Our inability to meet these competitive requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In the past, competition has led to pressure to reduce prices and the need to invest in advanced manufacturing technology which, the Company believes, contributed to the decrease in the number of independent photomask suppliers. These pressures may continue in the future.\nThe Company's substantial international operations are subject to additional risks.\nSales from the Company\u2019s non-U.S. operations were approximately 76%, 75% and 77% of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We believe that maintaining significant international operations requires us to have, among other things, a local presence in the geographic markets that we supply. This requires significant investments in financial, managerial, operational, and other resources. Since 1996, the Company has significantly expanded its operations in international markets by acquiring existing businesses in Europe, acquiring majority equity interests in photomask manufacturing operations in Korea and Taiwan and building a manufacturing facility for FPD photomasks in Taiwan. In August 2016 we announced that we will invest $160 million, in the form of a combination of cash and transferred capital, over the next five years to construct an IC research and development and manufacturing plant in Xiamen, China. The Company, in order to enable it to optimize its investments and other resources, closely monitors the semiconductor and FPD manufacturing markets for indications of geographic movement and, in conjunction with these efforts, continues to assess the locations of its manufacturing facilities. These assessments may result in the opening or closing of facilities.\nOperations outside of the United States are subject to inherent risks, including fluctuations in exchange rates, unstable political and economic conditions in various countries, changes in economic alliances (such as the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union), unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, longer accounts receivable payment cycles and potentially adverse tax consequences. These factors may have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to generate sales outside of the United States and, consequently, on its business and results of operations.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and are reported in U.S. dollars. The Company's operations have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Korean won, New Taiwan dollar, Japanese yen, euro, Singapore dollar, and the pound sterling. In fiscal 2017, as a result of our commencing construction of a new facility in China, we will have transactions and balances denominated in the Chinese renminbi. In fiscal 2016 the Company recorded a net loss from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $0.3 million in its statement of income, while its net assets were increased by $6.3 million as a result of the translation of foreign currency financial statements to U.S. dollars. In the event of significant foreign currency fluctuations, the Company's results of\noperations, financial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected.\nThe Company's business depends on managerial and technical personnel, who are in great demand, and its inability to attract and retain qualified employees could adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations.\nThe Company's success depends, in part, upon key managerial and technical personnel, as well as its ability to continue to attract and retain additional qualified personnel. The loss of certain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the Company can retain its key managerial, and technical employees, or that it can attract similar additional employees in the future.\nThe Company may be unable to enforce or defend its ownership and use of proprietary technology, and the utilization of unprotected Company developed technology by its competitors could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company believes that the success of its business depends more on its proprietary technology, information and processes, and know-how than on its patents or trademarks. Much of its proprietary information and technology related to manufacturing processes is not patented and may not be patentable. The Company cannot offer assurance that:\n\u00b7\nit will be able to adequately protect its technology;\n\u00b7\ncompetitors will not independently develop similar technology; or\n\u00b7\ninternational intellectual property laws will adequately protect its intellectual property rights.\nThe Company may become the subject of infringement claims or legal proceedings by third parties with respect to current or future products or processes. Any such claims, with or without merit, or litigation to enforce or protect its intellectual property rights that require the Company to defend itself against claimed infringements of the rights of others, could result in substantial costs, diversion of resources, and product shipment delays or could force the Company to enter into royalty or license agreements, rather than dispute the merits of these claims. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company may be unprepared for changes to environmental laws and regulations and may incur liabilities arising from environmental matters.\nThe Company is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental controls on, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and the handling, use, storage, disposal and clean-up of solid and hazardous wastes. Changes in these laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Any failure by the Company to adequately comply with these laws and regulations could subject it to significant future liabilities.\nIf we violate environmental, health and safety laws or regulations, in addition to being required to correct such violations, we can be held liable in administrative, civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations. Liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances, as well as personal injury, property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of, or exposure to, such hazardous substances, may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault, and may also be imposed jointly and severally (so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved, or even the entire loss). Such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue, including, for example, entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property, as well as entities that currently own or operate such property. The nature of our business, including historical operations at our current and former facilities, exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production, storage, use, transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment. Additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites, and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable, that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we\ncould reasonably incur for such matters\nThe Company's production facilities could be damaged or disrupted by natural disasters or labor strikes, either of which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nA major catastrophe, such as an earthquake or other natural disaster, labor strike, or work stoppage at any manufacturing facility of the Company, its suppliers, or its customers, could result in a prolonged interruption of the Company\u2019s business. A disruption resulting from any one of these events could cause significant delays in shipments of our products and the loss of sales and customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company's facilities in Taiwan are located in a seismically active area.\nThe Company's sales can be impacted by the health and stability of the general economy, which could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions in the U.S. or other countries in which the Company or its customers conduct business may have the effect of reducing the demand for photomasks. Economic downturns may lead to a decrease in demand for end products whose manufacturing processes involve the use of photomasks, which may result in a reduction in new product design and development by semiconductor or FPD manufacturers, and adversely affect the Company's results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditional taxes could adversely affect the Company's financial results.\nThe Company's tax filings are subjected to audits by tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which it does business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are subsequently resolved with the authorities or through the courts. Currently, we believe there are no outstanding assessments whose resolution would result in a material adverse financial result. However, the Company cannot offer assurances that unasserted or potential future assessments would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company's business could be adversely impacted by global or regional catastrophic events.\nThe Company's business could be adversely affected by terrorist acts, major natural disasters, widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases, or the outbreak or escalation of wars, especially in the Asian markets, where the Company generates a significant portion of its sales, and in Japan where it purchases raw materials and capital equipment. Such events in the geographic regions in which the Company does business, including escalations of political tensions and military operations within the Korean Peninsula, where a major portion of the Company's foreign operations are located, could have material adverse impacts on its sales volume, cost and availability of raw materials, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nServicing the Company's debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not generate sufficient cash flows from our operations to pay our indebtedness.\nThe Company's ability to make scheduled payments of debt principal and interest or to refinance its indebtedness depends on its future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond the Company's control. Our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future to both service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flows, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. The Company's ability to refinance its indebtedness would depend upon the conditions in the capital markets and its financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.", "PERMNO": 11154, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "PLAB"}
