{"cik": "1037676", "company": "ARCH COAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nOur business involves certain risks and uncertainties. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, we may face other risks and uncertainties, some of which may be unknown to us and some of which we may deem immaterial and the following review of important risk factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with other cautionary statements that are included herein or elsewhere. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Chapter 11 Cases\nAs a result of the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions, we are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy proceedings, and operating under Chapter 11 may restrict our ability to pursue strategic and operational initiatives.\nFor the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases (In re Arch Coal, Inc., et al.), our operations and our ability to execute our business strategy will be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These risks include:\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain Court approval with respect to motions filed in the Chapter 11 Cases from time to time;\n\u00b7 our ability to comply with and operate under any cash management orders entered by the Court from time to time;\n\u00b7 our ability to comply with our Restructuring Support Agreement and DIP Credit Agreement terms and conditions;\n\u00b7 our ability to confirm and consummate a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization;\n\u00b7 our ability to fund and execute our business plan; and\n\u00b7 our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThese risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways. For example, negative events or publicity associated with the Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect our relationships with our suppliers, customers and employees. In particular, critical vendors may determine not to do business with us due to our Chapter 11 filing and we may not be successful in securing alternative sources. Also, transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Court, which may limit our ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of opportunities. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 reorganization process may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and there is no certainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nUnder Chapter 11, transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Court, which may limit our ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. Additionally, the terms of the DIP Credit Agreement require us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants, including (i) maximum capital expenditures and (ii) minimum unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. The DIP Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for debtor-in-possession financings, which include restrictions on (i) indebtedness, (ii) liens and guaranties, (iii) liquidations, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions, (iv) disposition of assets or subsidiaries, (v) affiliate transactions, (vi) creation or ownership of certain subsidiaries, partnerships and joint ventures, (vii) continuation of or change in business, (viii) restricted payments, (ix) sanctions and anti-corruption matters, (x) no restriction in agreements on dividends or certain loans, (xi) loans and investments, (xii) transactions with respect to Bonding Subsidiaries and (xiii) hedging transactions. In addition, the DIP Credit Agreement contains milestones relating to the Chapter 11 Cases. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control and our failure to comply could result in an event of default under the DIP Credit Agreement.\nTrading in our securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. We expect that the existing common stock of the Company will be extinguished and existing equity holders will not receive consideration in respect of their equity interests.\nOn the Petition Date, the NYSE determined that the Company\u2019s stock (NYSE: ACI) was no longer suitable for listing pursuant to Section 8.02.01D of the NYSE continued listing standards and trading in the Company\u2019s common stock was suspended on January 11, 2016. We expect that the existing common stock of the Company will be extinguished upon the\nCompany\u2019s emergence from Chapter 11 and existing equity holders will not receive consideration in respect of their equity interests. Following delisting from the NYSE, Arch common stock has been traded over the counter in the Pink Sheets, but this may not always be the case. The delisting by the NYSE could result in significantly lower trading volumes and reduced liquidity for investors seeking to buy or sell shares of our common stock.\nArch\u2019s Restructuring Support Agreement provides that, upon the Company\u2019s emergence from Chapter 11, Arch\u2019s existing stock will be cancelled and the senior lenders will receive the substantial majority of the new stock in the reorganized Arch. If a plan of reorganization is approved in the Chapter 11 Cases, it is likely that our existing common stock will be extinguished, and existing equity holders will likely not receive consideration in respect of their existing equity interests.\nThe pursuit of the Chapter 11 Cases has consumed and will continue to consume a substantial portion of the time and attention of our management, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we may face increased levels of employee attrition.\nWhile the Chapter 11 Cases continue, our management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort focusing on the cases. This diversion of attention may materially adversely affect the conduct of our business, and, as a result, on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the Chapter 11 Cases are protracted.\nDuring the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, our employees will face considerable distraction and uncertainty and we may experience increased levels of employee attrition. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet customer expectations, thereby adversely affecting our business and results of operations. The failure to retain or attract members of our management team and other key personnel could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, thereby having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, or if current financing is insufficient or exit financing is not available, we could be required to seek a sale of the Company or certain of its material assets pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or liquidate under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nIn order to successfully emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, we must obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization by the Court. If confirmation by the Court does not occur, we could be forced to sell the Company or certain of its material assets pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or liquidate under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nThere can be no assurance that our current cash position and amounts of cash from future operations will be sufficient to fund operations. In the event that we do not have sufficient cash to meet our liquidity requirements, and our current financing is insufficient or exit financing is not available, we may be required to seek additional financing. There can be no assurance that such additional financing would be available, or, if available, would be available on acceptable terms. Failure to secure any necessary exit financing or additional financing would have a material adverse effect on our operations and ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur post-bankruptcy capital structure has yet to be determined, and any changes to our capital structure may have a material adverse effect on existing debt and security holders.\nOur capital structure will be set pursuant to a plan of reorganization that requires Court approval. Any reorganization of our capital structure may include exchanges of new debt or equity securities for our existing debt and equity securities, and such new debt or equity securities may be issued at different interest rates, payment schedules and maturities than our existing creditors. The success of a reorganization through any such exchanges or modifications will depend on approval by the Court and the willingness of existing debt and security holders to agree to the exchange or modification, and there can be no guarantee of success. If such exchanges or modifications are successful, holders of our debt may find their holdings no longer have any value or are materially reduced in value, or they may be converted to equity and be diluted or may be modified or\nreplaced by debt with a principal amount that is less than the outstanding principal amount, longer maturities and reduced interest rates. There can be no assurance that any new debt or equity securities will maintain their value at the time of issuance.\nAny plan of reorganization that we may implement will be based in large part upon assumptions and analyses developed by us. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, or adverse market conditions persist or worsen, our plan may be unsuccessful in its execution.\nAny plan of reorganization that we may implement will affect both our capital structure and the ownership, structure and operation of our businesses and will reflect assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we consider appropriate under the circumstances. Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with our expectations and assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to (i) our ability to substantially change our capital structure; (ii) our ability to obtain adequate liquidity and financing sources; (iii) our ability to maintain customers\u2019 confidence in our viability as a continuing entity and to attract and retain sufficient business from them; (iv) our ability to retain key employees, and (v) the overall strength and stability of general economic conditions of the financial and coal industries, both in the U.S. and in global markets. The failure of any of these factors could materially adversely affect the successful reorganization of our businesses.\nIn addition, any plan of reorganization will rely upon financial projections, including with respect to revenues, EBITDA, capital expenditures, debt service and cash flow. Financial forecasts are necessarily speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be accurate. In our case, the forecasts will be even more speculative than normal, because they may involve fundamental changes in the nature of our capital structure. Accordingly, we expect that our actual financial condition and results of operations will differ, perhaps materially, from what we have anticipated. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by any plan of reorganization we may implement will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on us and our subsidiaries or our businesses or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could materially adversely affect the successful execution of any plan of reorganization.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities are subject to uncertainty, and our historical financial information will not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nOur capital structure will likely be significantly altered under any plan of reorganization ultimately confirmed by the Court. Under fresh-start reporting rules that may apply to us upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization, our assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair values and our accumulated deficit would be restated to zero. Accordingly, if fresh-start reporting rules apply, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements. Further, a plan of reorganization could materially change the amounts and classifications reported in our consolidated historical financial statements, which do not give effect to any adjustments to the carrying value of assets or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary as a consequence of confirmation of a plan of reorganization.\nWhile operating under the protection of the Bankruptcy Code, and subject to Court approval or otherwise as permitted in the normal course of business, we may sell or otherwise dispose of assets and liquidate or settle liabilities for amounts other than those reflected in our consolidated financial statements. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and the development of a plan of reorganization, it is also possible that additional restructuring and related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such sales, disposals, liquidations, settlements or charges could be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations in any given period.\nWe may be unable to comply with restrictions imposed by our DIP Credit Agreement, our Securitization Facility and other financing arrangements.\nThe agreements governing our outstanding financing arrangements impose a number of restrictions on us. For example, the terms of our credit facilities, leases and other financing arrangements contain financial and other covenants that create limitations on our ability to borrow the full amount under our credit facilities, effect acquisitions or dispositions and\nincur additional debt and require us to maintain minimum levels of liquidity and various financial ratios and comply with various other financial covenants. Specifically, the terms of the DIP Credit Agreement require us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants, including (i) maximum capital expenditures and (ii) minimum unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. The DIP Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for debtor-in-possession financings, which include restrictions on (i) indebtedness, (ii) liens and guaranties, (iii) liquidations, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions, (iv) disposition of assets or subsidiaries, (v) affiliate transactions, (vi) creation or ownership of certain subsidiaries, partnerships and joint ventures, (vii) continuation of or change in business, (viii) restricted payments, (ix) sanctions and anti-corruption matters, (x) no restriction in agreements on dividends or certain loans, (xi) loans and investments, (xii) transactions with respect to Bonding Subsidiaries and (xiii) hedging transactions. In addition, the DIP Credit Agreement contains milestones relating to the Chapter 11 Cases. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control and our failure to comply could result in an event of default under the DIP Credit Agreement, the Securitization Facility or our other financing arrangements.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nCoal prices are subject to change based on a number of factors and coal prices are currently experiencing an historic level of depression. If coal prices remain depressed, or if there is a further decline in prices, it could materially and adversely affect our profitability and the value of our coal reserves.\nOur profitability and the value of our coal reserves depend upon the prices we receive for our coal. The contract prices we may receive in the future for coal depend upon factors beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7 the domestic and foreign supply of and demand for coal;\n\u00b7 the domestic and foreign demand for electricity and steel;\n\u00b7 the quantity and quality of coal available from competitors;\n\u00b7 competition for production of electricity from non-coal sources, including the price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u00b7 domestic and foreign air emission standards for coal-fueled power plants and the ability of coal-fueled power plants to meet these standards;\n\u00b7 adverse weather, climatic or other natural conditions, including unseasonable weather patterns;\n\u00b7 domestic and foreign economic conditions, including economic slowdowns and the exchange rate of U.S. dollars for foreign currency;\n\u00b7 domestic and foreign legislative, regulatory and judicial developments, environmental regulatory changes or changes in energy policy and energy conservation measures that would adversely affect the coal industry, such as legislation limiting carbon emissions or providing for increased funding and incentives for alternative energy sources;\n\u00b7 the proximity to, capacity of and cost of transportation and port facilities; and\n\u00b7 market price fluctuations for sulfur dioxide or nitric oxide emission allowances.\nDue to a number of factors outside our control, including decelerating demand for coal used in electricity (due to low natural gas prices and regulations), an oversupplied market and increased competition particularly from non-U.S. suppliers taking advantage of a strong dollar, we have experienced a sustained and significant downturn in coal pricing over the last several years. The global metallurgical coal market remains challenged and has shown no meaningful improvement over the\nlast several years. We are also experiencing higher than normal uncommitted volumes due to prolonged, depressed market conditions. Pricing may be adversely affected or we may need to reduce production as a result of our uncommitted volume levels. If coal prices remain depressed, or if there is a further decline in the prices we receive for our future coal sales contracts, it could materially and adversely affect us by decreasing our profitability and the value of our coal reserves.\nUnfavorable economic and market conditions have adversely affected and may continue to affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur profitability depends, in large part, on conditions in the markets that we serve, which fluctuate in response to various factors beyond our control. The prices at which we sell our coal are largely dependent on prevailing market prices. We have experienced significant price pressure over the past several years, and we expect that the price for our coal will continue to be depressed, as the demand for, and price of, coal remains subject to pressure for a variety of reasons, including reductions in domestic and international demand for metallurgical and thermal coal. These conditions, among other factors, have led to our filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions.\nGlobal economic downturns have also had and in the future could have a negative impact on us. These conditions have, in the past, led to extreme volatility of security prices, severely limited liquidity and credit availability, and resulted in declining valuations of assets. If there are downturns in economic conditions, our customers\u2019 and our businesses, financial conditions or results of operations could be adversely affected. During unfavorable economic conditions we are focused on cost control and capital discipline, but there can be no assurance that these actions, or any other actions that we may take, will be sufficient to offset any adverse effect these conditions may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCompetition could put downward pressure on coal prices and, as a result, materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe compete with numerous other domestic and foreign coal producers for domestic and international sales. Overcapacity and increased production within the coal industry, both domestically and internationally, and decelerating steel demand in China have, and could further, materially reduce coal prices and therefore materially reduce our revenues and profitability. In addition, our ability to ship our coal to international customers depends on port capacity, which is limited. Increased competition within the coal industry for international sales could result in us not being able to obtain throughput capacity at port facilities, or the rates for such throughput capacity to increase to a point where it is not economically feasible to export our coal.\nIn addition to competing with other coal producers, we compete generally with producers of other fuels, such as natural gas. Natural gas pricing has declined significantly in recent years. The decline in the price of natural gas has caused demand for coal to decrease and adversely affect the price of our coal. Sustained periods of low natural gas prices have also contributed to utilities phasing out or closing existing coal-fired power plants and continued low prices could reduce construction of any new coal-fired power plants. This trend has, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on demand and prices for our coal.\nAny change in the coal consumption of electric power generators could result in less demand and lower prices for coal, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nThermal coal accounted for 95% of our coal sales by volume during 2015. The majority of these sales were to electric power generators. The amount of coal consumed for electric power generation is affected primarily by the overall demand for electricity, the availability, quality and price of competing fuels for power generation and governmental regulations. Gas-fueled generation has the potential to displace coal-fueled generation, particularly from older, less efficient coal-powered generators and this has occurred to date. We expect that many of the new power plants needed in the United States to meet increasing demand for electricity generation will be fueled by natural gas because gas-fired plants are cheaper to construct and permits to construct these plants are easier to obtain as natural gas is seen as having a lower environmental impact than coal-fueled generation. In addition, state and federal mandates for increased use of electricity from renewable energy sources also have an impact on the market for our coal. Several states have enacted legislative mandates requiring electricity suppliers to use\nrenewable energy sources to generate a certain percentage of power. There have been numerous proposals to establish a similar uniform, national standard although none of these proposals have been enacted to date. Possible advances in technologies and incentives, such as tax credits, to enhance the economics of renewable energy sources could make these sources more competitive with coal. Any reduction in the amount of coal consumed by electric power generators could reduce the price of coal that we mine and sell, thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations.\nOur coal mining operations are subject to operating risks that are beyond our control, which could result in materially increased operating expenses and decreased production levels and could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nWe mine coal at underground and surface mining operations. Certain factors beyond our control, including those listed below, could disrupt our coal mining operations, adversely affect production and shipments and increase our operating costs:\n\u00b7 poor mining conditions resulting from geological, hydrologic or other conditions that may cause instability of highwalls or spoil piles or cause damage to nearby infrastructure or mine personnel;\n\u00b7 a major incident at the mine site that causes all or part of the operations of the mine to cease for some period of time;\n\u00b7 mining, processing and plant equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems;\n\u00b7 adverse weather and natural disasters, such as heavy rains or snow, flooding and other natural events affecting operations, transportation or customers;\n\u00b7 unexpected or accidental surface subsidence from underground mining;\n\u00b7 accidental mine water discharges, fires, explosions or similar mining accidents;\n\u00b7 delays or closures by third-party transportation on coal shipments; and\n\u00b7 competition and/or conflicts with other natural resource extraction activities and production within our operating areas, such as coalbed methane extraction or oil and gas development.\nIf any of these conditions or events occurs, particularly at our Black Thunder mining complex, which accounted for approximately 78% of the coal volume we sold in 2015, our coal mining operations may be disrupted and we could experience a delay or halt of production or shipments or our operating costs could increase significantly. In addition, if our insurance coverage is limited or excludes certain of these conditions or events, then we may not be able to recover any of the losses we may incur as a result of such conditions or events, some of which may be substantial.\nA decline in demand for metallurgical coal would limit our ability to sell our coal into higher-priced metallurgical markets and could substantially affect our business.\nPortions of our coal reserves possess quality characteristics that enable us to mine, process and market them as either metallurgical coal or high quality steam coal, depending on the prevailing conditions in the metallurgical and steam coal markets. We decide whether to mine, process and market these coals as metallurgical or steam coal based on management\u2019s assessment as to which market is likely to provide us with a higher margin. We consider a number of factors when making this assessment, including the difference between the current and anticipated future market prices of steam coal and metallurgical coal and the increased costs incurred in producing coal for sale in the metallurgical market instead of the steam market. The global metallurgical coal market remains challenged and has shown no meaningful improvement over the last several quarters, due to, among other things, reduced steel production. A further decline in, or prices remaining depressed in, the metallurgical market relative to the steam market could cause us, as well as our competitors, to shift coal from the metallurgical market to the steam market, thereby reducing our revenues and profitability and increasing the availability of coal to customers in the steam market.\nOur inability to acquire additional coal reserves or our inability to develop coal reserves in an economically feasible manner may adversely affect our business.\nOur profitability depends substantially on our ability to mine and process, in a cost-effective manner, coal reserves that possess the quality characteristics desired by our customers. As we mine, our coal reserves decline. As a result, our future success depends upon our ability to acquire additional coal that is economically recoverable. If we fail to acquire or develop additional coal reserves, our existing reserves will eventually be depleted. We may not be able to obtain replacement reserves when we require them. If available, replacement reserves may not be available at favorable prices, or we may not be capable of mining those reserves at costs that are comparable with our existing coal reserves. Our ability to obtain coal reserves in the future could also be limited by the availability of cash we generate from our operations or available financing, restrictions under our existing or future financing arrangements (including under our DIP Credit Agreement), competition from other coal producers, the lack of suitable acquisition or lease-by-application, or LBA, opportunities or the inability to acquire coal properties or LBAs on commercially reasonable terms, and restrictions on making acquisitions as a result of our Chapter 11 Cases. If we are unable to acquire replacement reserves, our future production may decrease significantly and our operating results may be negatively affected. In addition, we may not be able to mine future reserves as profitably as we do at our current operations.\nOn January 15, 2016, the federal government ordered a moratorium on new leases for coal mined from federal lands as part of a review of the government\u2019s management of federally-owned coal. The delay in the LBA process caused by the moratorium could prevent us from obtaining replacement reserves when we require them. Also, the outcome of the government\u2019s review is uncertain and could have a material and adverse impact on our business in any number of ways including by limiting our ability to mine reserves under ongoing or future applications, by increasing the costs or timeframe associated with obtaining leases under the LBA program, by making it uneconomical for us to participate in the programs or by preventing us from obtaining replacement reserves if the LBA program were to be terminated.\nInaccuracies in our estimates of our coal reserves could result in decreased profitability from lower than expected revenues or higher than expected costs.\nOur future performance depends on, among other things, the accuracy of our estimates of our proven and probable coal reserves. We base our estimates of reserves on engineering, economic and geological data assembled, analyzed and reviewed by internal and third-party engineers and consultants. We update our estimates of the quantity and quality of proven and probable coal reserves annually to reflect the production of coal from the reserves, updated geological models and mining recovery data, the tonnage contained in new lease areas acquired and estimated costs of production and sales prices. There are numerous factors and assumptions inherent in estimating the quantities and qualities of, and costs to mine, coal reserves, including many factors beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7 quality of the coal;\n\u00b7 geological and mining conditions, which may not be fully identified by available exploration data and/or may differ from our experiences in areas where we currently mine;\n\u00b7 the percentage of coal ultimately recoverable;\n\u00b7 the assumed effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits, taxes, including severance and excise taxes and royalties, and other payments to governmental agencies;\n\u00b7 assumptions concerning the timing for the development of the reserves;\n\u00b7 assumptions concerning physical access to the reserves; and\n\u00b7 assumptions concerning equipment and productivity, future coal prices, operating costs, including for critical supplies such as fuel, tires and explosives, capital expenditures and development and reclamation costs.\nAs a result, estimates of the quantities and qualities of economically recoverable coal attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery, estimated cost of production, and estimates of future net cash flows expected from these properties as prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary materially due to changes in the above factors and assumptions. Actual production recovered from identified reserve\nareas and properties, and revenues and expenditures associated with our mining operations, may vary materially from estimates. Any inaccuracy in our estimates related to our reserves could result in decreased profitability from lower than expected revenues and/or higher than expected costs.\nFailure to obtain or renew surety bonds on acceptable terms could affect our ability to secure reclamation and coal lease obligations and, therefore, our ability to mine or lease coal, and a loss or reduction in our ability to self-bond could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFederal and state laws require us to obtain surety bonds or post letters of credit to secure performance or payment of certain long-term obligations, such as mine closure or reclamation costs, federal and state workers\u2019 compensation costs, coal leases and other obligations. The costs of surety bonds have fluctuated in recent years while the market terms of such bonds have generally become more unfavorable to mine operators. These changes in the terms of the bonds have been accompanied at times by a decrease in the number of companies willing to issue surety bonds. Because we are required by state and federal law to have these bonds in place before mining can commence or continue, our failure to maintain surety bonds, letters of credit or other guarantees or security arrangements would materially and adversely affect our ability to mine or lease coal. We use self-bonding to secure performance of certain obligations in Wyoming. Self-bonding allows us to mine without posting any other third party financial assurance such as a surety bond or letter of credit. As of December 31, 2015, we have self-bonded an aggregate of approximately $485.5 million. The Land Quality Division of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality periodically re-evaluates the amount of the bond, so this amount is subject to change.\nOn February 29, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court approved a stipulation between certain of our operating subsidiaries and the State of Wyoming, pursuant to which those subsidiaries granted Wyoming a $75 million superpriority claim to support the self-bonded obligations and agreed to substitute approximately $17 million of the self-bonds with financial assurance in the form of third-party collateral support. In exchange, Wyoming agreed to a stay of any proceedings related to the subsidiaries\u2019 self-bonded status and that, so long as the stipulation is effective, Wyoming will not seek additional collateral in respect of the self-bonds, take certain other adverse actions with respect to the subsidiaries\u2019 mining permits or licenses in Wyoming or seek to enforce the subsidiaries\u2019 obligations to make payments in respect of the self-bonds. The stipulation is effective until the earlier of May 1, 2017 and the date upon which a plan of reorganization in the Chapter 11 Cases is approved and becomes effective, subject to certain early termination events.\nOur self-bonding obligations may increase as our bankruptcy process continues, and, upon our emergence from bankruptcy or otherwise, we may not continue to qualify to self-bond or self-bonding programs may be terminated. Alternative forms of financial assurance such as surety bonds and letters of credit may not be available to us. To the extent we are unable to maintain our current level of self-bonding, due to legislative or regulatory changes or changes in our financial condition, our costs would increase and it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as cast substantial doubt on our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIncreases in the costs of mining and other industrial supplies, including steel-based supplies, diesel fuel and rubber tires, or the inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of those supplies, could negatively affect our operating costs or disrupt or delay our production.\nOur coal mining operations use significant amounts of steel, diesel fuel, explosives, rubber tires and other mining and industrial supplies. The cost of roof bolts we use in our underground mining operations depends on the price of scrap steel. We also use significant amounts of diesel fuel and tires for trucks and other heavy machinery, particularly at our Black Thunder mining complex. If the prices of mining and other industrial supplies, particularly steel based supplies, diesel fuel and rubber tires, increase, our operating costs could be negatively affected. In addition, if we are unable to procure these supplies, our coal mining operations may be disrupted or we could experience a delay or halt in our production.\nDisruptions in the quantities of coal produced by our contract mine operators or purchased from other third parties could temporarily impair our ability to fill customer orders or increase our operating costs.\nWe use independent contractors to mine coal at certain of our mining complexes, including select operations in our Appalachian segment. In addition, we purchase coal from third parties that we sell to our customers. Operational difficulties at contractor-operated mines or mines operated by third parties from whom we purchase coal, changes in demand for contract miners from other coal producers and other factors beyond our control could affect the availability, pricing, and quality of coal produced for or purchased by us. Disruptions in the quantities of coal produced for or purchased by us could impair our ability to fill our customer orders or require us to purchase coal from other sources in order to satisfy those orders. If we are unable to fill a customer order or if we are required to purchase coal from other sources in order to satisfy a customer order, we could lose existing customers and our operating costs could increase.\nOur profitability depends upon the long-term coal supply agreements we have with our customers. Changes in purchasing patterns in the coal industry could make it difficult for us to extend our existing long-term coal supply agreements or to enter into new agreements in the future.\nThe success of our businesses depends on our ability to retain our current customers, renew our existing customer contracts and solicit new customers. Our ability to do so generally depends on a variety of factors, including the quality and price of our products, our ability to market these products effectively, our ability to deliver on a timely basis and the level of competition that we face. If current customers do not honor current contract commitments, or if they terminate agreements or exercise force majeure provisions allowing for the temporary suspension of performance, our revenues will be adversely affected. Changes in the coal industry may cause some of our customers not to renew, extend or enter into new long-term coal supply agreements or enter into agreements to purchase fewer tons of coal or on different terms or prices than in the past. In addition, uncertainty caused by federal and state regulations, including the Clean Air Act, could deter our customers from entering into long-term coal supply agreements. Also, the availability and price of competing fuels, such as natural gas, could influence the volume of coal a customer is willing to purchase under contract.\nOur long-term coal supply agreements typically contain force majeure provisions allowing the parties to temporarily suspend performance during specified events beyond their control. Most of our long-term coal supply agreements also contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal that satisfies certain quality specifications, such as heat value, sulfur content, ash content, hardness and ash fusion temperature. These provisions in our long-term coal supply agreements could result in negative economic consequences to us, including price adjustments, purchasing replacement coal in a higher-priced open market, the rejection of deliveries or, in the extreme, contract termination. Our profitability may be negatively affected if we are unable to seek protection during adverse economic conditions or if we incur financial or other economic penalties as a result of these provisions of our long-term supply agreements. For more information about our long-term coal supply agreements, you should see the section entitled \u201cLong-Term Coal Supply Arrangements\u201d under Item 1.\nOur ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness deteriorates and our financial position could be materially and adversely effected by the bankruptcy of any of our significant customers.\nOur ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness of our customers. If we determine that a customer is not creditworthy, we may be able to withhold delivery under the customer\u2019s coal sales contract. If this occurs, we may decide to sell the customer\u2019s coal on the spot market, which may be at prices lower than the contracted price, or we may be unable to sell the coal at all. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of any of our significant customers could materially and adversely affect our financial position.\nIn addition, our customer base may change with deregulation as utilities sell their power plants to their non-regulated affiliates or third parties that may be less creditworthy, thereby increasing the risk we bear for customer payment default. Some power plant owners may have credit ratings that are below investment grade, or may become below investment grade after we enter into contracts with them. In addition, competition with other coal suppliers could force us to extend credit to customers and on terms that could increase the risk of payment default. Customers in other countries may also be subject to other\npressures and uncertainties that may affect their ability to pay, including trade barriers, exchange controls and local economic and political conditions.\nA defect in title or the loss of a leasehold interest in certain property could limit our ability to mine our coal reserves or result in significant unanticipated costs.\nWe conduct a significant part of our coal mining operations on properties that we lease. A title defect or the loss of a lease could adversely affect our ability to mine the associated coal reserves. We may not verify title to our leased properties or associated coal reserves until we have committed to developing those properties or coal reserves. We may not commit to develop property or coal reserves until we have obtained necessary permits and completed exploration. As such, the title to property that we intend to lease or coal reserves that we intend to mine may contain defects prohibiting our ability to conduct mining operations. Similarly, our leasehold interests may be subject to superior property rights of other third parties. In order to conduct our mining operations on properties where these defects exist, we may incur unanticipated costs. In addition, some leases require us to produce a minimum quantity of coal and require us to pay minimum production royalties. Our inability to satisfy those requirements may cause the leasehold interest to terminate.\nThe availability, reliability and cost-effectiveness of transportation facilities and fluctuations in transportation costs could affect the demand for our coal or impair our ability to supply coal to our customers.\nWe depend upon barge, ship, rail, truck and belt transportation systems, as well as seaborne vessels and port facilities, to deliver coal to our customers. Disruptions in transportation services due to weather-related problems, mechanical difficulties, strikes, lockouts, bottlenecks, route closures and other events beyond our control could impair our ability to supply coal to our customers. Since we do not have long-term contracts with all transportation providers we utilize, decreased performance levels over longer periods of time could cause our customers to look to other sources for their coal needs. In addition, increases in transportation costs, including the price of gasoline and diesel fuel, could make coal a less competitive source of energy when compared to alternative fuels or could make coal produced in one region of the United States less competitive than coal produced in other regions of the United States or abroad. If we experience disruptions in our transportation services or if transportation costs increase significantly and we are unable to find alternative transportation providers, our coal mining operations may be disrupted, we could experience a delay or halt of production or our profitability could decrease significantly.\nIn addition, a growing portion of our coal sales in recent years has been into export markets, and we are actively seeking additional international customers. Our ability to maintain and grow our export sales revenue and margins depends on a number of factors, including the existence of sufficient and cost-effective export terminal capacity for the shipment of coal to foreign markets. At present, there is limited terminal capacity for the export of coal into foreign markets. Our access to existing and future terminal capacity may be adversely affected by regulatory and permit requirements, environmental and other legal challenges, public perceptions and resulting political pressures, operational issues at terminals and competition among domestic coal producers for access to limited terminal capacity, among other factors. If we are unable to maintain terminal capacity, or are unable to access additional future terminal capacity for the export of our coal on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, our results could be materially and adversely affected.\nFrom time to time we enter into \u201ctake or pay\u201d contracts for rail and port capacity related to our export sales. These contracts require us to pay for a minimum quantity of coal to be transported on the railway or through the port regardless of whether we sell and ship any coal. If we fail to acquire sufficient export sales to meet our minimum obligations under these contracts we are still obligated to make payments to the railway or port facility, which could have a negative impact on our cash flows, profitability and results of operations.\nThe loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our profitability.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we derived approximately 18% of our total coal revenues from sales to our three largest customers and approximately 39% of our total coal revenues from sales to our ten largest customers. We are currently discussing the extension of coal sales agreements with some of these customers. However, we may be unsuccessful in obtaining coal supply agreements with those customers, and some or all of these customers could discontinue purchasing coal\nfrom us. If any of those customers, particularly any of our three largest customers, was to significantly reduce the quantities of coal it purchases from us, or if we are unable to sell coal to those customers on terms as favorable to us, it may have an adverse impact on the results of our business.\nWe may incur losses as a result of certain marketing, trading and asset optimization strategies.\nWe seek to optimize our coal production and leverage our knowledge of the coal industry through a variety of marketing, trading and other asset optimization strategies. We maintain a system of complementary processes and controls designed to monitor and control our exposure to market and other risks as a consequence of these strategies. These processes and controls seek to balance our ability to profit from certain marketing, trading and asset optimization strategies with our exposure to potential losses. While we employ a variety of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, those techniques and accompanying judgments cannot anticipate every potential outcome or the timing of such outcomes. In addition, the processes and controls that we use to manage our exposure to market and other risks resulting from these strategies involve assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack thereof among prices of various assets or other market indicators. These correlations may change significantly in times of market turbulence or other unforeseen circumstances. As a result, we may experience volatility in our earnings as a result of our marketing, trading and asset optimization strategies.\nInternational growth in our operations adds new and unique risks to our business.\nWe have recently opened offices in China, Singapore and the United Kingdom. The international expansion of our operations increases our exposure to country and currency risks. In addition, our international offices are selling our coal to new customers and customers in new countries, whose business practices and reputations are not as well known to us. We are also challenged by political risks by expanding internationally, including the potential for expropriation of assets and limits on the repatriation of earnings. In the event that we are unable to effectively manage these new risks, our results of operations, financial position or cash flow could be adversely affected by these activities.\nIf we sustain cyber attacks or other security breaches that disrupt our operations, or that result in the unauthorized release of proprietary or confidential information, we could be exposed to significant liability, reputational harm, loss of revenue, increased costs or other risks.\nWe may be subject to security breaches which could result in unauthorized access to our facilities or to information we are trying to protect. Unauthorized physical access to one or more of our facilities or locations, or electronic access to our proprietary or confidential information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, litigation by parties affected by such breach, disruptions to our operations, loss of customers, and financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a substantial impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Environmental, Other Regulations and Legislation\nExtensive environmental regulations, including existing and potential future regulatory requirements relating to air emissions, affect our customers and could reduce the demand for coal as a fuel source and cause coal prices and sales of our coal to materially decline.\nCoal contains impurities, including but not limited to sulfur, mercury, chlorine and other elements or compounds, many of which are released into the air when coal is burned. The operations of our customers are subject to extensive environmental regulation particularly with respect to air emissions. For example, the federal Clean Air Act and similar state and local laws extensively regulate the amount of sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and other compounds emitted into the air from electric power plants, which are the largest end-users of our coal. A series of more stringent requirements relating to particulate matter, ozone, haze, mercury, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and other air pollutants are expected to be proposed or become effective in coming years. The Clean Power Plan, under review by U.S. courts, would severely limit emissions of carbon dioxide which would adversely affect our ability to sell coal. In addition, concerted conservation efforts that result in reduced electricity consumption could cause coal prices and sales of our coal to materially decline.\nConsiderable uncertainty is associated with these air emissions initiatives. The content of regulatory requirements in the United States is in the process of being developed, and many new regulatory initiatives remain subject to review by federal or state agencies or the courts. Stringent air emissions limitations are either in place or are likely to be imposed in the short to medium term, and these limitations will likely require significant emissions control expenditures for many coal-fueled power plants. As a result, these power plants may switch to other fuels that generate fewer of these emissions or may install more effective pollution control equipment that reduces the need for low sulfur coal, possibly reducing future demand for coal and a reduced need to construct new coal-fueled power plants. Any switching of fuel sources away from coal, closure of existing coal-fired plants, or reduced construction of new plants could have a material adverse effect on demand for and prices received for our coal. Alternatively, less stringent air emissions limitations, particularly related to sulfur, to the extent enacted could make low sulfur coal less attractive, which could also have a material adverse effect on the demand for and prices received for our coal.\nYou should see Item 1, \u201cEnvironmental and Other Regulatory Matters\u201d for more information about the various governmental regulations affecting us.\nThe demand for our products or our securities, as well as the number and quantity of viable financing alternatives, may be significantly impacted by increased regulation or other scrutiny of topics related to coal combustion.\nGlobal climate issues and topics related to greenhouse gas emissions, such as the impact of fossil fuel combustion, continue to attract increasing public scrutiny. Legislative or regulatory efforts at the international, federal, state or local level to control emissions from the combustion of coal may result in electricity generators increasingly using fuel sources other than coal or closures of coal-fueled power plants. In addition, certain banks and other financing sources have taken actions to limit available financing for the development of new coal-fueled power plants, which also may adversely impact the future global demand for coal. Further, there have been recent efforts by members of the general financial and investment communities, such as investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, to divest themselves and to promote the divestment of securities issued by companies involved in the fossil fuel extraction market, such as coal producers. Those entities also have been pressuring lenders to limit financing available to such companies. These efforts may adversely affect the market for our securities and our ability to access capital and financial markets in the future.\nAny future laws, regulations or other policies of the nature described above may adversely impact our business in material ways. The degree to which any particular law, regulation or policy impacts us will depend on several factors, including the substantive terms involved, the relevant time periods for enactment and any related transition periods. We routinely attempt to evaluate the potential impact on us of any proposed laws, regulations or policies, which requires that we make several material assumptions. From time to time, we determine that the impact of one or more such laws, regulations or policies, if adopted and ultimately implemented as proposed, may result in materially adverse impacts on our operations, financial condition or cash flow; however, we often are not able to reasonably quantify such impacts. In general, however, it is likely that any future laws, regulations or other policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions will negatively impact demand for our coal.\nOur failure to obtain and renew permits necessary for our mining operations could negatively affect our business.\nMining companies must obtain numerous permits that impose strict regulations on various environmental and operational matters in connection with coal mining. These include permits issued by various federal, state and local agencies and regulatory bodies. The permitting rules, and the interpretations of these rules, are complex, change frequently and are often subject to discretionary interpretations by the regulators, all of which may make compliance more difficult or impractical, and may possibly preclude the continuance of ongoing operations or the development of future mining operations. The public, including non-governmental organizations, anti-mining groups and individuals, have certain statutory rights to comment upon and submit objections to requested permits and environmental impact statements prepared in connection with applicable regulatory processes, and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including bringing citizens\u2019 lawsuits to challenge the issuance of permits, the validity of environmental impact statements or performance of mining activities. Accordingly, required permits may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion or at all, or permits issued or renewed may be conditioned in a\nmanner that may restrict our ability to efficiently and economically conduct our mining activities, any of which would materially reduce our production, cash flow and profitability.\nFederal or state regulatory agencies have the authority to order certain of our mines to be temporarily or permanently closed under certain circumstances, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\nFederal or state regulatory agencies have the authority under certain circumstances following significant health and safety incidents, such as fatalities, to order a mine to be temporarily or permanently closed. If this occurred, we may be required to incur capital expenditures to re-open the mine. In the event that these agencies order the closing of our mines, our coal sales contracts generally permit us to issue force majeure notices which suspend our obligations to deliver coal under these contracts. However, our customers may challenge our issuances of force majeure notices. If these challenges are successful, we may have to purchase coal from third-party sources, if it is available, to fulfill these obligations, incur capital expenditures to re-open the mines and/or negotiate settlements with the customers, which may include price reductions, the reduction of commitments or the extension of time for delivery or terminate customers\u2019 contracts. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nExtensive environmental regulations impose significant costs on our mining operations, and future regulations could materially increase those costs or limit our ability to produce and sell coal.\nThe coal mining industry is subject to increasingly strict regulation by federal, state and local authorities with respect to environmental matters such as:\n\u00b7 limitations on land use;\n\u00b7 mine permitting and licensing requirements;\n\u00b7 reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed;\n\u00b7 management of materials generated by mining operations;\n\u00b7 the storage, treatment and disposal of wastes;\n\u00b7 remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater;\n\u00b7 air quality standards;\n\u00b7 water pollution;\n\u00b7 protection of human health, plant-life and wildlife, including endangered or threatened species;\n\u00b7 protection of wetlands;\n\u00b7 the discharge of materials into the environment;\n\u00b7 the effects of mining on surface water and groundwater quality and availability; and\n\u00b7 the management of electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls.\nThe costs, liabilities and requirements associated with the laws and regulations related to these and other environmental matters may be costly and time-consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations. We cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations, the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from our operations. We may incur material costs and liabilities resulting from claims for damages to property or injury to persons arising from our operations. If we are pursued for sanctions, costs and liabilities in respect of these matters, our mining operations and, as a result, our profitability could be materially and adversely affected.\nNew legislation or administrative regulations or new judicial interpretations or administrative enforcement of existing laws and regulations, including proposals related to the protection of the environment that would further regulate and tax the coal industry, may also require us to change operations significantly or incur increased costs. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. You should see the section entitled \u201cEnvironmental and Other Regulatory Matters\u201d in Item 1 for more information about the various governmental regulations affecting us.\nIf the assumptions underlying our estimates of reclamation and mine closure obligations are inaccurate, our costs could be greater than anticipated.\nSMCRA and counterpart state laws and regulations establish operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining, as well as most aspects of underground mining. We base our estimates of reclamation and mine closure liabilities on permit requirements, engineering studies and our engineering expertise related to these requirements. Our management and engineers periodically review these estimates. The estimates can change significantly if actual costs vary from our original assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly. We are required to record new obligations as liabilities at fair value under generally accepted accounting principles. In estimating fair value, we considered the estimated current costs of reclamation and mine closure and applied inflation rates and a third-party profit, as required. The third-party profit is an estimate of the approximate markup that would be charged by contractors for work performed on our behalf. The resulting estimated reclamation and mine closure obligations could change significantly if actual amounts change significantly from our assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our properties may have environmental contamination, which could result in material liabilities to us.\nOur operations currently use hazardous materials and generate limited quantities of hazardous wastes from time to time. We could become subject to claims for toxic torts, natural resource damages and other damages as well as for the investigation and cleanup of soil, surface water, groundwater, and other media. Such claims may arise, for example, out of conditions at sites that we currently own or operate, as well as at sites that we previously owned or operated, or at sites that we may acquire. Our liability for such claims may be joint and several with other owners or operators, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages, or even for the entire share.\nWe maintain extensive coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments at a number of our mining complexes. Such areas and impoundments are subject to extensive regulation. Slurry impoundments can fail, which could release large volumes of coal slurry into the surrounding environment. Structural failure of an impoundment can result in extensive damage to the environment and natural resources, such as bodies of water that the coal slurry reaches, as well as liability for related personal injuries and property damages, and injuries to wildlife. Some of our impoundments overlie mined-out areas, which can pose a heightened risk of failure and of damages arising out of failure. If one of our impoundments were to fail, we could be subject to substantial claims for the resulting environmental contamination and associated liability, as well as for fines and penalties.\nDrainage flowing from or caused by mining activities can be acidic with elevated levels of dissolved metals, a condition referred to as \u201cacid mine drainage,\u201d which we refer to as AMD. The treating of AMD can be costly. Although we do not currently face material costs associated with AMD, it is possible that we could incur significant costs in the future.\nThese and other similar unforeseen impacts that our operations may have on the environment, as well as exposures to hazardous substances or wastes associated with our operations, could result in costs and liabilities that could materially and adversely affect us.\nJudicial rulings that restrict how we may dispose of mining wastes could significantly increase our operating costs, discourage customers from purchasing our coal and materially harm our financial condition and operating results.\nTo dispose of mining overburden generated by our Appalachian surface mining operations, we often need to obtain permits to construct and operate valley fills and surface impoundments. Some of these permits are Clean Water Act \u00a7 404 permits issued by the Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps). Two of our operating subsidiaries were identified in an existing lawsuit, which challenged the issuance of such permits and asked that the Corps be ordered to rescind them. Two of our operating subsidiaries intervened in the suit to protect their interests in being allowed to operate under the issued permits, and the claims against one of the subsidiaries was thereafter dismissed. On February 13, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled on appeals from decisions rendered prior to our intervention, which may have a favorable impact on our permits. The matter is pending before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia on Mingo Logan\u2019s motion for summary judgment. If the matter is resolved ultimately in a manner that is adverse to the interests of our operating\nsubsidiaries, such subsidiaries\u2019 operating results may be adversely impacted. For more information regarding this litigation matter you should see the section entitled \u201cLegal Proceedings-Permit Litigation Matters\u201d under Item 3.\nChanges in the legal and regulatory environment could complicate or limit our business activities, increase our operating costs or result in litigation.\nThe conduct of our businesses is subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States. These laws and regulations may change, sometimes dramatically, as a result of political, economic or social events or in response to significant events. Environmental and other non-governmental organizations and activists, many of which are well funded, continue to exert pressure on regulators and other government bodies to enact more stringent laws and regulations. Changes in the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate may impact our results, increase our costs or liabilities, complicate or limit our business activities or result in litigation. Such legal and regulatory environment changes may include changes in such items as: the processes for obtaining or renewing permits; self-bonding programs; federal lease by application programs; costs associated with providing healthcare benefits to employees; health and safety standards; accounting standards; taxation requirements; and competition laws.\nFor example, in April 2010, the EPA issued comprehensive guidance regarding the water quality standards that EPA believes should apply to certain new and renewed Clean Water Act permit applications for Appalachian surface coal mining operations. Under the EPA\u2019s guidance, applicants seeking to obtain state and federal Clean Water Act permits for surface coal mining in Appalachia must perform an evaluation to determine if a reasonable potential exists that the proposed mining would cause a violation of water quality standards. According to the EPA Administrator, the water quality standards set forth in the EPA\u2019s guidance may be difficult for most surface mining operations to meet. Additionally, the EPA\u2019s guidance contains requirements for the avoidance and minimization of environmental and mining impacts, consideration of the full range of potential impacts on the environment, human health and local communities, including low-income or minority populations, and provision of meaningful opportunities for public participation in the permit process. The EPA\u2019s guidance is subject to several pending legal challenges related to its legal effect and sufficiency including consolidated challenges pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia led by the National Mining Association. We may be required to meet these requirements in the future in order to obtain and maintain permits that are important to our Appalachian operations. We cannot give any assurance that we will be able to meet these or any other new standards.\nIn response to the April 2010 explosion at Massey Energy Company\u2019s Upper Big Branch Mine and the ensuing tragedy, we expect that safety matters pertaining to underground coal mining operations will continue to be the topic of new legislation and regulation, as well as the subject of heightened enforcement efforts. For example, federal and West Virginia state authorities have announced special inspections of coal mines to evaluate several safety concerns, including the accumulation of coal dust and the proper ventilation of gases such as methane. In addition, both federal and West Virginia state authorities have announced that they are considering changes to mine safety rules and regulations which could potentially result in additional or enhanced required safety equipment, more frequent mine inspections, stricter and more thorough enforcement practices and enhanced reporting requirements. Any new environmental, health and safety requirements may increase the costs associated with obtaining or maintaining permits necessary to perform our mining operations or otherwise may prevent, delay or reduce our planned production, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, mining companies are entitled a tax deduction for percentage depletion, which may allow for depletion deductions in excess of the basis in the mineral reserves. The deduction is currently being reviewed by the federal government for repeal. If repealed, the inability to take a tax deduction for percentage depletion could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future tax payments.", "PERMNO": 75326, "SIC": 1220, "TIC": "ARCH"}
