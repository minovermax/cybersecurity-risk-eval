{"cik": "1757898", "company": "STERIS plc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-05-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nThis section describes certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should consider these risk factors when evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, because our actual results and financial condition might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements should these risks occur. We face other risks besides those highlighted below. These other risks include additional uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial, but may ultimately have a significant impact. In addition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate any of these risks, which could have a material effect on us. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. Should any of these risks, described below or otherwise, actually occur, our business, financial condition, performance, prospects, value, or results of operations could be negatively affected.\nLEGAL, REGULATORY AND TAX RISKS\nDoing Business Internationally\nCompliance with multiple, and potentially conflicting, international laws and regulations, import and export limitations, anti-corruption laws, and exchange controls may be difficult, burdensome or expensive.\nWe are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We are also subject to limitations on trade with persons in sanctioned countries. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot assure you that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics.\nChanges in economic climate may adversely affect us.\nAdverse economic cycles or conditions, and Customer, regulatory or government response to those cycles or conditions, have affected and could further affect our results of operations. The onset of these cycles or conditions may not be foreseeable and there can be no assurance when they will begin to improve after they occur. There also can be no assurance as to the strength or length of any recovery from a business downturn or recession. Credit and liquidity problems may make it difficult for some businesses to access credit markets and obtain financing and may cause some businesses to curtail spending to conserve cash in anticipation of persistent business slowdowns and liquidity needs. If our Customers have difficulty financing their purchases due to tight credit markets or related factors or because of other operational or utilization problems they may be experiencing or otherwise decide to curtail their purchases, our business could be adversely affected. Our exposure to bad debt losses could also increase if Customers are unable to pay for products previously ordered and delivered.\nSome of our Customers are governmental entities or other entities that rely on government healthcare systems or government funding. If government funding for healthcare becomes limited or restricted in countries in which we operate, including as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, our Customers may be unable to pay their obligations on a timely basis or to make payment in full and it may become necessary to increase reserves. In addition, there can be no assurance that there will not be an increase in collection difficulties. Prospectively, additional adverse effects resulting from these conditions may include decreased healthcare utilization, further pricing pressure on our products and services, and/or weaker overall demand for our products and services, particularly capital products.\nOur acquisition activity and ability to grow organically may be adversely affected if we are unable to continue to access the financial markets.\nOur recent acquisitions have been financed largely through cash on hand and borrowings under our bank credit facilities and through public note offerings in early April of fiscal 2022. Future acquisitions or other capital requirements will necessitate additional cash. To the extent our existing sources of cash are insufficient to fund these or other future activities, we have and may need to raise additional funds through new or expanded borrowing arrangements or equity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funds beyond those available under existing bank credit facilities on terms favorable to us, or at all, or that such facilities can be replaced when they terminate.\nThe current military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and its implications on U.S., Canadian and European Union relations with Russia could cause long term geopolitical and economic instability that may impact our future operating results.\nIn response to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine that began in February 2022, the United States, other North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, as well as non-member states, announced targeted economic sanctions on Russia. The long-term impact on our business resulting from the disruption of trade in the region caused by the conflict and associated sanctions and boycotts is uncertain at this time due to the fluid nature of the ongoing military conflict and response. The potential impacts include supply chain and logistics disruptions, financial impacts including volatility in foreign exchange and interest rates, increased inflationary pressure on raw materials and energy, and other risks including an elevated risk of\ncybersecurity threats and the potential for further sanctions. We have stopped operating in Russia and Belarus, which includes shipments to Customers and purchases of cobalt-60 from our Russian supplier. Our operations located in the region did not represent a material portion of our consolidated assets or revenues. A long-term disruption in cobalt-60 sourced from Russia may negatively impact gamma processing capacity or increase costs in certain portions of our AST operations but these impacts are not expected to be material to our AST segment and its results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic disrupted our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition if further significant disruptions occur.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, along with the response to the pandemic by governmental and other actors, disrupted our operations. We experienced temporary mandatory and voluntary facility closures in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. Furthermore, we have experienced less demand for certain of our products and services as a result of deferrals of certain medical procedures, and other factors, which we believe was exacerbated by the impact of stay-at-home orders. Additionally, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused temporary disruptions and rising costs in our supply chain and distribution network.\nLong-term facility closures or other restrictions could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff, supply or otherwise maintain our operations. Such restrictions also may have a substantial impact on our Customers and our sales cycles. The COVID-19 pandemic may put pressure on overall spending for our products and services, and may cause our Customers to modify spending priorities or delay or abandon purchasing decisions. Moreover, because a large number of our employees have been and will continue to work from home routinely, we may be subject to increased vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks. We have modified, and may further modify, our business practices in response to the risks and negative impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be temporary or successful.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and its ultimate duration, severity and disruption to our business, Customers and supply chain, and the related financial impact to us, cannot be accurately forecasted at this time. Should such additional significant disruptions occur and continue for an extended period, the adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be more severe. Additionally, weak economic conditions, the pace for economic recovery, and rising inflation, could result in extended weak demand for our products and services. Furthermore, future public health crises are possible and could involve some or all of the risks discussed above.\nHealthcare Laws and Reimbursement\nChanges in healthcare laws or government and other third-party payor reimbursement levels to healthcare providers, or failure to meet healthcare reimbursement or other requirements, might negatively impact our business.\nWe sell many of our products and services to hospitals and other healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers. Many of these Customers are subject to or supported by government programs or receive reimbursement for services from third-party payors, such as government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S., private insurance plans, and managed care programs. Reimbursement systems vary significantly by country. Government-managed healthcare systems control reimbursement for healthcare services in many countries. Public budgetary constraints may significantly impact the ability of hospitals, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other Customers supported by such systems to purchase our products. Government or other third-party payors may deny or change coverage, reduce their current levels of reimbursement for healthcare services, or otherwise implement measures to regulate pricing or contain costs. In addition, our costs may increase more rapidly than reimbursement levels or permissible pricing increases or we may not satisfy the standards or requirements for reimbursement.\nAmong other provisions, the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, imposed an excise tax on medical devices manufactured or offered for sale in the United States. Late in 2019, U.S. Congress enacted legislation that repealed the excise tax, which had been suspended during calendar years 2016 through 2019. In addition, we have been required to commit significant resources to \u201cSunshine Act\u201d compliance. Various additional health care reform proposals have emerged at the federal and state level, and we are unable to predict which, if any, of those proposals will be enacted.\nProduct and Service Related Regulations and Claims\nWe are subject to extensive regulatory requirements and must receive and maintain regulatory clearance or approval for many products and operations. Failure to receive or maintain, or delays in receiving, clearance or approvals may hurt our revenues, profitability, financial condition, or value.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation in the countries where we do business. In the United States, our products and services are regulated by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In many foreign countries, sales of our products and services are subject to extensive regulations that may or may not be comparable to those of the FDA. In Europe, our products are regulated primarily by country and community regulations of those countries within the European Economic Area and must conform to the requirements of those authorities.\nGovernment regulation applies to nearly all aspects of testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storing, recordkeeping, reporting, promoting, distributing, and importing or exporting of medical devices, products, and services. In general, unless an exemption applies, a sterilization, decontamination or medical device or product or service must receive regulatory approval or clearance before it can be marketed or sold. Modifications to existing products or the marketing of new uses for existing products also may require regulatory approvals, approval supplements or clearances. If we are unable to obtain any required approvals, approval supplements or clearances for any modification to a previously cleared or approved device, we may be required to cease manufacturing and sale, or recall or restrict the use of such modified device, pay fines, or take other action until such time as appropriate clearance or approval is obtained.\nRegulatory agencies may refuse to grant approval or clearance, or review and disagree with our interpretation of approvals or clearances, or with our decision that regulatory approval is not required or has been maintained. Regulatory submissions may require the provision of additional data and may be time consuming and costly, and their outcome is uncertain. Regulatory agencies may also change policies, adopt additional regulations, or revise existing regulations, each of which could prevent or delay approval or clearance of devices, or could impact our ability to market a previously cleared, approved, or unregulated device. Our failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA or other applicable regulatory requirements in the United States or elsewhere might subject us to administratively or judicially imposed sanctions. These sanctions include, among others, warning letters, fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties, injunctions, debarment, product seizure or detention, product recalls and total or partial suspension of production, sale and/or promotion.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt the operations of regulatory bodies with responsibility for oversight of healthcare and health and medical products. Such disruptions could result in the focus and prioritization of regulatory resources on emergent matters, which could divert regulatory resources away from more routine regulatory matters that are not COVID-19 related but that have the potential to impact our business. For example, there could be delays in FDA review of applications for marketing authorization, including those which may be necessary for or in connection with proposed changes to our products or the changes to the processes by which they are manufactured. It is unknown how long these disruptions could continue, were they to occur. Any elongation or de-prioritization or delay in regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially affect our ongoing device design, development, and commercialization plans.\nOur products are subject to recalls and restrictions, even after receiving United States or foreign regulatory clearance or approval.\nOngoing medical device reporting regulations require that we report to appropriate governmental authorities in the United States and/or other countries when our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. Governmental authorities can require product recalls or impose restrictions for product design, manufacturing, labeling, clearance, or other issues. For the same reasons, we may voluntarily elect to recall or restrict the use of a product. Any recall or restriction could divert managerial and financial resources and might harm our reputation among our Customers and other healthcare professionals who use or recommend our products and services.\nWe may be adversely affected by product liability claims or other legal actions or regulatory or compliance matters.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims and other legal and regulatory actions. A significant increase in the number, severity, amount, or scope of these claims and actions may, as described above with respect to recalls and restrictions, result in substantial costs and harm our reputation or otherwise adversely affect product sales and our business. Product liability claims and other legal and regulatory actions may also distract management from other business responsibilities.\nWe are also subject to a variety of other types of claims, proceedings, investigations, and litigation initiated by government agencies or third parties and other potential risks and liabilities. These include compliance matters, product regulation or safety, taxes, employee benefit plans, employment discrimination, health and safety, environmental, antitrust, customs, import/export, government contract compliance, financial controls or reporting, intellectual property, allegations of misrepresentation, false claims or false statements, commercial claims, claims regarding promotion of our products and services, or other similar or different matters. Any such claims, proceedings, investigations or litigation, regardless of the merits, might result in substantial costs, restrictions on product use or sales, or otherwise injure our business.\nAdministratively or judicially imposed or agreed sanctions might include warning letters, fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties, loss of tax benefits, injunctions, product seizure, recalls, suspensions or restrictions, re-labeling, detention, and/or debarment. We also might be required to take actions such as payment of substantial amounts, or revision of financial statements, or to take, or be subject to, the following types of actions with respect to our products, services, or business: redesign, re-label, restrict, or recall products; cease manufacturing and selling products; seizure of product inventory; comply with a court injunction restricting or prohibiting further marketing and sale of products or services; comply with a consent decree, which could result in further regulatory constraints; dedication of significant internal and external resources and costs to respond to and comply with legal and regulatory issues and constraints; respond to claims, litigation, and other proceedings brought by Customers, users, governmental agencies, and others; disruption of product improvements and product launches; discontinuation of certain product lines or services; or other restrictions or limitations on product sales, use or operation, or other activities or business practices.\nSome product replacements or substitutions may not be possible or may be prohibitively costly or time consuming. The impact of any legal, regulatory, or compliance claims, proceeding, investigation, or litigation, is difficult to predict.\nWe maintain product liability and other insurance with coverages believed to be adequate. However, product liability or other claims may exceed insurance coverage limits, fines, penalties and regulatory sanctions may not be covered by insurance, or insurance may not continue to be available or available on commercially reasonable terms. Additionally, our insurers might deny claim coverage for valid or other reasons or may become insolvent.\nOur business and financial condition could be adversely affected by difficulties in acquiring or maintaining a proprietary intellectual ownership position.\nTo maintain our competitive position for our products, we need to obtain patent or other proprietary rights for new and improved products and to maintain and enforce our existing patents and other proprietary rights. We typically apply for patents in the United States and in strategic other countries. We may also acquire patents through acquisitions. We may encounter difficulties in obtaining or protecting patents.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and confidentiality agreements to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology. These measures afford only limited protection, and competitors may gain access to our intellectual property and proprietary information. Litigation may be necessary to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. Litigation may also be brought against us claiming that we have violated the intellectual property rights of others. Litigation may be costly and may divert management\u2019s attention from other matters. Additionally, in some foreign countries with weaker intellectual property rights, it may be difficult to maintain and enforce patents and other proprietary rights or defend against claims of infringement.\nTax Risks\nWe might be adversely impacted by tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions.\nWe are subject to the tax laws at the federal, state or provincial, and local government levels in the many jurisdictions in which we operate or sell products or services. Tax laws might change in ways that adversely affect our tax positions, effective tax rate and cash flow. The tax laws are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. We are subject to tax examinations in various jurisdictions that might assess additional tax liabilities against us. Our tax reporting positions might be challenged by relevant tax authorities, we might incur significant expense in our efforts to defend those challenges, and we might be unsuccessful in those efforts. Developments in examinations and challenges might materially change our provision for taxes in the affected periods and might differ materially from our historical tax accruals. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations, our cash flows and our financial position or results of operations.\nCurrent economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction subject to significant change.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d) was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Guidance continues to be issued clarifying the application of this new legislation and new changes have been proposed in the U.S. that could increase our total tax expense. We cannot predict the overall impact that the additional guidance and proposed changes may have on our business. Some jurisdictions have raised tax rates and it is reasonable to expect that other global taxing authorities will be reviewing current legislation for potential modifications in reaction to the implementation of the TCJA, current economic conditions, and COVID-19 response costs.\nIn addition, further changes in the tax laws of other jurisdictions could arise, including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project undertaken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has issued recommendations that, in some cases, would make substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax positions and principles. These contemplated changes, to the extent adopted by OECD members and/or other countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our provision for income taxes.\nOur tax rate is uncertain and may vary from expectations, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and earnings per share.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain any particular worldwide effective corporate tax rate. We cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which we and our affiliates operate. Our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectations, and such variance may be material. Additionally, tax laws or their implementation and applicable tax authority practices in any particular jurisdiction could change in the future, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change could have a material adverse impact on us and our affiliates.\nChanges in tax treaties and trade agreements could negatively impact our costs, results of operations and earnings per share.\nLegislative and regulatory action may be taken in the U.S. which, if ultimately adopted, could override or otherwise adversely impact tax treaties upon which we rely or broaden the circumstances under which STERIS plc would be considered a U.S. resident, each of which could materially and adversely affect our tax obligations. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative or regulatory proposals. However, if proposals were adopted that had the effect of disregarding our organization in Ireland or limiting our ability as an Irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the U.S., we could be subject to increased taxation and/or potentially significant expense.\nExisting free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. Changes in laws and regulations or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular, increased trade restrictions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nProposed legislation relating to the denial of U.S. federal or state governmental contracts to U.S. companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business.\nVarious U.S. federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to redomiciled companies may adversely affect us if adopted into law. We are unable to predict the likelihood that any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, or the effect such enactments or increased regulatory scrutiny could have on our business.\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) may not agree that we are a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.\nAlthough we are organized under the laws of Ireland and are a tax resident in Ireland for Irish tax purposes, the IRS may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d and such Section, \u201cSection 7874\u201d). For U.S. federal tax purposes, a company generally is considered to be a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization. Because we are organized under the laws of Ireland, we would generally be classified as a non-U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a non-U.S. tax resident) under these rules. Section 7874, however, provides an exception to this general rule under which a non-U.S. organized entity may be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.\nIf we were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, we could be subject to substantial additional U.S. tax liability. Additionally, if we were treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, non-U.S. holders of our ordinary shares would be subject to U.S. withholding tax on the gross amount of any dividends we paid to such shareholders. For Irish tax purposes, we are expected, regardless of any application of Section 7874, to be treated as an Ireland tax resident. Consequently, if we are treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes under Section 7874, we could be liable for both U.S. and Ireland taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\nOur businesses are highly competitive, and if we fail to compete successfully, our revenues and results of operations may be hurt.\nWe operate in a highly competitive global environment. Our businesses compete with other broad-line manufacturers, as well as many smaller businesses specializing in particular products or services, primarily on the basis of brand, design, quality, safety, ease of use, serviceability, price, product features, warranty, delivery, service, and technical support. We face increased competition from new infection prevention, sterile processing, contamination control, surgical support, cleaning consumables, gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories, contract sterilization, and other products and services entering the market. Competitors and potential competitors also are attempting to develop alternate technologies and sterilizing agents, as well as disposable medical instruments and other devices designed to address the risk of contamination.\nConsolidations among our healthcare and pharmaceutical Customers may result in a loss of Customers or more significant pricing pressures.\nA number of our Customers have consolidated. These consolidations are due in part to healthcare cost reduction measures initiated by competitive pressures as well as legislators, regulators and third-party payors. This may result in greater pricing pressures on us and in some cases loss of Customers. Additional consolidations could result in a loss of Customers or more significant pricing pressures.\nDecreased availability or increased costs of raw materials or energy supplies or other supplies might increase our production costs or limit our production capabilities or curtail our operations.\nWe purchase raw materials, fabricated and other components, and energy supplies from a variety of suppliers. Key materials include stainless steel, organic and inorganic chemicals, fuel, cobalt-60, EO, and plastic components. The availability and prices of raw materials and energy supplies are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute materials, currency exchange rates, anticipated or perceived shortages, and other factors. Also, certain of our key materials and components have a limited number of suppliers. Some are single-sourced in certain regions of the world, such as cobalt-60 and EO, which are necessary to our AST operations. Changes in regulatory requirements regarding the use of, the unavailability or short supply of these products might disrupt or cause shutdowns of portions of our AST operations or have other adverse consequences. We have developed a plan to expand our irradiation processing capacity with accelerator-based technologies which may reduce the potential supply risk. Shortages in supply, increased regulatory or security requirements, or increases in the price of raw materials, components and energy supplies may adversely affect us. In response to the active conflict between Russian and Ukraine, we have stopped purchasing cobalt-60 from our Russian supplier. A long-term disruption in cobalt-60 sourced from Russia may negatively impact gamma processing capacity or increase costs in certain portions of our AST operations but these impacts are not expected to be material to our AST segment and its results of operations.\nOur operations, and those of our suppliers, are subject to a variety of business continuity hazards and risks, any of which could interrupt production or operations or otherwise adversely affect our performance, results, or value.\nBusiness continuity hazards and other risks include: explosions, fires, earthquakes, public health crises, inclement weather, and other disasters; utility or other mechanical failures; unscheduled downtime; labor difficulties; inability to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits; disruption of communications; data security, preservation and redundancy disruptions; inability to hire or retain key management or employees; disruption of supply or distribution; and regulation of the safety, security or other aspects of our operations.\nThe occurrence of these types of events has disrupted and may in the future disrupt or shut down operations, or otherwise adversely impact the production or profitability of a particular facility, or our operations as a whole. Certain casualties also might cause personal injury and loss of life, or severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, and for casualties occurring at our facilities, result in liability claims against us. Although we maintain property and casualty insurance and liability and similar insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for our industries, our insurance coverages have limits and we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business.\nWe may be adversely affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change.\nThe long-term effects of climate change are difficult to assess and predict. The impacts may include physical risks (such as rising sea levels or frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions), social and human effects (such as population dislocations or harm to health and well-being), compliance costs and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) and other adverse effects. The effects could impair, for example, the availability and cost of certain products, commodities and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require. We bear losses incurred as a result of, for example, physical damage to or destruction of our facilities (such as distribution or fulfillment centers), loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption due to weather events that may be attributable to climate change could materially adversely affect our business operations, financial position or results of operation.\nOur operations are subject to regulations and permitting, which may be changed or amended by the relevant authorities, and which may limit or eliminate our current operations or increase the complexity, burden, or expense of compliance and regulated materials or processes that we use in our operations may become the focus of litigation.\nOur AST segment is a technology-neutral contract sterilization service that offers our Customers a wide range of sterilization modalities through a worldwide network of over 50 contract sterilization and laboratory facilities. One of the modalities offered by our AST operations is EO sterilization. In the United States, several regulators, including the EPA, FDA, and agencies at the state and local level, play a role in regulating the use of EO sterilization. In 2016, the EPA changed the cancer risk basis for EO and determined that EO is carcinogenic to humans. Recent announcements of the temporary or permanent closure of EO sterilization facilities operated by others have been associated with state and/or local regulatory or other legal action related to EO emissions at those facilities. Our AST operations have taken and will continue to take measures to comply with all applicable emissions regulations and to reduce emissions. However, no assurance can be given that current or future legislative or regulatory action, or current or future litigation to which we are or may become a party, will not significantly increase the costs of conducting our EO contract sterilization operations or curtail or eliminate the use of EO in our contract sterilization operations. A significant reduction in our EO contract sterilization activities may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, we could be liable for damages and fines as a result of legislative or regulatory action or litigation, and any liability could exceed our insurance and indemnification coverage, if any, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Additionally, for many medical devices, EO sterilization may be the only current method of sterilization that effectively sterilizes and does not damage the device during the sterilization process. In the event of regulatory, legislative, or legal action that curtails or eliminates EO sterilization, there could be a shortage of medical devices and consequently a decline in surgical procedures. A decline in surgical procedures could result in a decline in demand for the products and services provided by our Healthcare business, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe engage in acquisitions and affiliations, divestitures, and other business arrangements. Our growth may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully identify, price, and integrate strategic business candidates or otherwise optimize our business portfolio.\nOur success depends, in part, on strategic acquisitions and joint ventures, which are intended to complement or expand our businesses, divestiture of non-strategic businesses, and other actions intended to optimize our portfolio of businesses. This strategy depends upon our ability to identify, appropriately price, and complete these types of business development transactions or arrangements and to obtain any necessary financing. In the last several fiscal years we have made a number of acquisitions. We also completed several divestitures of non-strategic businesses or product lines during the last several years.\nOur success with respect to these recent and future acquisitions will depend on our ability to integrate the businesses acquired, retain key personnel, realize identified cost synergies and otherwise execute our strategies. Our success will also depend on our ability to develop satisfactory working arrangements with our strategic partners in joint ventures or other affiliations, or to divest or realign businesses. Competition for strategic business candidates may result in increases in costs and price for acquisition candidates and market valuation issues may reduce the value available for divestiture of non-strategic businesses. These types of transactions are also subject to a number of other risks and uncertainties, including: delays in realizing or failure to realize anticipated benefits of the transactions; diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns; difficulties in retaining key employees, Customers, or suppliers of the acquired or divested businesses; difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, or other integration or divestiture difficulties; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers or Customers; other events contributing to difficulties in generating future cash flows; risks associated with the assumption of contingent or other liabilities of acquisition targets or retention of liabilities for divested businesses and difficulties in obtaining financing.\nIf our continuing efforts to create a lean business and in-source production to reduce costs are not successful, our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected.\nWe have undertaken various activities to create a lean business, including in-sourcing. We continue to look for opportunities to in-source production that is currently provided by third parties.These activities may not produce the full efficiencies and cost reduction benefits that we expect or efficiencies and benefits might be delayed. Implementation costs also might exceed expectations. Increases in costs of doing business may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic or similar public health crises could have a material adverse impact on ability to staff our operations.\nAs supplier to Healthcare and Life Sciences Customers, we fall within a \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d sector, and are also considered an essential business and therefore were exempt under various stay at home/shelter in place orders associated with COVID-19. Accordingly, our employees continued to work because of the importance of our operations to the health and well-being of citizens in the countries in which we operate. We implemented telework policies wherever possible for appropriate categories of employees. However, our employees that are unable to telework continued to work at our facilities and those of our Customers, and we implemented appropriate safety measures, such as social distancing and increased cleaning protocols. While we believe that we have developed appropriate measures to ensure the health and well-being of our employees, there can be no assurances that our measures will be sufficient to protect our employees in our workplace or that they may not otherwise be exposed to COVID-19 or similar illness outside of our workplace. If a number of our essential employees become ill, incapacitated or are otherwise unable or unwilling to continue working during the current or any future health crises, our operations may be adversely impacted.\nOur business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to recruit and retain qualified management and other personnel or other compliance matters adversely impact our personnel.\nOur continued success depends, in large part, on our ability to hire and retain highly qualified people and if we are unable to do so, our business and operations may be impaired or disrupted. Competition for highly qualified people is intense and there is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining replacements to fill vacant positions, successors to fill retirements or employees moving to new positions, or other highly qualified personnel. In addition, legal, regulatory or compliance matters create significant distraction or diversion of significant or unanticipated resources or attention that could have a material adverse effect on the responsibilities and retention of qualified employees.\nWe could experience a failure of a key information technology system, process or site or a breach of information security, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers.\nWe rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems to conduct business. In addition, we rely on networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. While we have been the previous target of cyberattacks and security breaches, none of these attacks or breaches to date have had a material adverse effect on the Company. We cannot guarantee that future cyberattacks, if successful, will not have a material effect on our business or financial results. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats continue to pose potential risks to the security of our IT systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. While we have made investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems, hiring of experts, employee training and security policies for employees and third-party providers, the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. If our IT systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the risk of such vulnerability and attacks, including unauthorized access or attacks exploiting the fact that a large number of employees are working remotely during government shutdowns and closures. Furthermore, their has also been an increase in cyber incidents that appears to be associated with the Ukraine-Russia military conflict. Enforcement of the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) was effective as of May 2018. The GDPR is focused on the protection of personal data not merely the privacy of personal data. The GDPR creates a range of new compliance obligations and will significantly increase financial penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to 4% of global annual revenues for the preceding financial year or \u20ac20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements).\nNet sales and profitability of our Dental segment are highly dependent on our relationships with a limited number of large distributors.\nThe distribution network in the U.S. dental industry is concentrated, with relatively few distributors of consumable products accounting for a significant share of the sales volume to dentists. Historically, the top three Customers of Cantel's Dental segment accounted for more than 40.0% of its revenues. The loss of a significant amount of business from any of these Customers would have a material adverse effect on our Dental segment. In addition, because our Dental segment products are primarily sold through third-party distributors and not directly to end users, we cannot control the amount and timing of resources that our distributors devote to our products. There can be no assurance that there will not be a loss or reduction in business from one or more of our major Customers. In addition, we cannot assure that revenues from Customers that have accounted for significant revenues in the past, either individually or as a group, will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF CANTEL MEDICAL\nThe integration of Cantel into STERIS may not be as successful as anticipated.\nThe integration involves numerous operational, strategic, financial, accounting, legal, tax and other risks; potential liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; and uncertainties related to design, operation and integration of Cantel\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Difficulties in integrating Cantel into STERIS may result in Cantel performing differently than expected, in operational challenges or in the failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. STERIS\u2019s and Cantel\u2019s existing businesses could also be negatively impacted by the actions. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include, among other factors:\n\u2022the inability to successfully integrate the business of Cantel into STERIS in a manner that permits STERIS to achieve the full revenue and cost savings anticipated from the acquisition;\n\u2022complexities associated with managing the larger, more complex, integrated business;\n\u2022not realizing anticipated operating synergies or incurring unexpected costs to realize such synergies;\n\u2022integrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and services;\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022loss of key employees;\n\u2022integrating relationships with Customers, vendors and business partners;\n\u2022performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by integrating Cantel\u2019s operations into STERIS; and\n\u2022the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each company\u2019s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.\nThe acquisition of Cantel may not be as accretive to STERIS\u2019s earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share, which may negatively affect the market price of STERIS Shares.\nThe acquisition may not be as accretive to STERIS\u2019s earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share. Future events and conditions could decrease or delay any expected accretion, result in dilution or cause greater dilution than is currently expected, including adverse changes in market conditions, production levels, operating results, competitive conditions, laws and regulations affecting STERIS, capital expenditure obligations, higher than expected integration costs, lower than expected synergies and general economic conditions.\nAny decrease or delay of any accretion to, STERIS\u2019s earnings per share or cash flow from operations per share could cause the price of the STERIS's ordinary shares to decline.\nSTERIS has incurred and will incur significant transaction and acquisition-related costs in connection with the acquisition, which may be in excess of those anticipated.\nSTERIS has incurred substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the acquisition of Cantel and related transactions.\nSTERIS expects to continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with combining the operations of STERIS and Cantel achieving desired synergies. These fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial. The non-recurring expenses include, among others, employee retention costs, fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, and severance and benefit costs.\nSTERIS will also incur and has incurred costs related to implementing integration plans, costs to consolidate facilities and systems and employment-related costs. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies\u2019 businesses. Although STERIS expects that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the STERIS and Cantel businesses, should allow STERIS to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. See the risk factor titled \u201cThe integration of Cantel into STERIS may not be as successful as anticipated\u201d below.\nThe costs described above, as well as other unanticipated costs and expenses, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating results.\nWe incurred a substantial amount of additional debt to complete the acquisition. Our debt level may limit our financial and business flexibility.\nWe funded the cash portion of the acquisition consideration, as well as the refinancing, prepayment, replacement, redemption, repurchase, settlement upon conversion, discharge or defeasance of certain existing indebtedness of Cantel and its subsidiaries, transaction expenses, general corporate expenses and working capital needs, through the incurrence of approximately $2.1 billion of new indebtedness, which includes $1.350 billion of senior notes issued April 1, 2021 and a new delayed draw term loan agreement in the amount of $750 million. We also refinanced or settled approximately $1.0 billion of Cantel's long-term indebtedness, including convertible debt, outstanding.\nAs of March 31, 2022, STERIS had approximately $2.9 billion of long-term indebtedness outstanding. STERIS\u2019s ability to repay all the forgoing obligations will depend on, among other things, STERIS\u2019s financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control.\nOur increased indebtedness could have important consequences to our shareholders, including increasing STERIS\u2019s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements, requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and general corporate matters, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and our industry and creating a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness.\nOur performance may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage the expansion, which poses numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate the operations and business of Cantel into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner, to combine systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with Customers, vendors and business partners.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe success of the acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses, including the approximately $110 million in annualized pre-tax cost synergies that we expect to realize within the first four fiscal years after the completion of the acquisition. The anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected, may require more non-recurring costs and expenditures to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee. Some of the assumptions that we made such as with respect to anticipated operating synergies or the costs associated with realizing such synergies, significant long-term cash flow generation, and the continuation of our investment grade credit profile, may not be realized. The integration process may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies. There could be potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisition that were not discovered while performing due diligence.\nWe have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that could become impaired and result in material non-cash changes to our results of operation in the future.\nThe acquisition has been accounted for as an acquisition by STERIS in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which is referred to as U.S. GAAP. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Cantel and its subsidiaries have been recorded at their respective fair values and added to those of STERIS. Our reported financial condition and results of operations for periods after completion of the acquisition reflect Cantel balances and results after completion of the acquisition but have not been restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of Cantel and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the acquisition.\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price has been allocated to Cantel\u2019s tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill. To the extent the value of goodwill or intangible becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material non-cash charges relating to such impairment. Our operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the impairment.", "PERMNO": 77649, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "STE"}
