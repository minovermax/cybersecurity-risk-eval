{"cik": "1357971", "company": "Energy Services of America CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-01-05", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risk and uncertainties described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business financial condition and results of operations could be impacted, and we may not be able to achieve our expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events that are intended as \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d under Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should be read in conjunction with the section entitled \u201cForward looking statements\u201d.\nRisk Related to our Operations\nOur operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nWe typically experience lower volumes and lower margins during the winter months due to lower demand for our pipeline services and more difficult operating conditions. Also, other items that can materially affect our quarterly results include:\n\u00b7 Adverse weather;\n\u00b7 Variations in the mix of our work in any quarter;\n\u00b7 Shortage of qualified labor;\n\u00b7 Unfavorable regional, national or global economic and market conditions;\n\u00b7 A reduction in the demand for our services;\n\u00b7 Changes in customer spending patterns and need for the services we provide;\n\u00b7 Unanticipated increases in construction and design costs;\n\u00b7 Timing and volume of work we perform;\n\u00b7 Termination of existing agreements;\n\u00b7 Losses experienced not covered by insurance;\n\u00b7 Payment risks associated with customer financial condition;\n\u00b7 Changes in bonding requirements of agreements;\n\u00b7 Interest rate variations; and\n\u00b7 Changes in accounting pronouncements.\nRisk Related to our Business\nThe type of contracts we obtain could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe enter into various types of contracts, including fixed price and variable pricing contracts. On fixed price contracts our profits could be curtailed or eliminated by unanticipated pricing increases associated with the contract.\nA portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds. We may be unable to compete on certain projects if we are not able to obtain the necessary surety bonds.\nCurrent or future market conditions, including losses in the construction industry or as a result of large corporate bankruptcies, as well as changes in our surety providers\u2019 assessment of our operating and financial risk, could cause our surety providers to decline to issue or renew, or substantially reduce the amount of bonds for our work or could increase our bonding costs. These actions could be taken on short notice. Since a growing number of our customers require such bonding, should our surety providers limit or eliminate our access to bonding, our performance could be negatively impacted if we are unable to replace the bonded business with work that does not require bonding or if we are unable to provide other means of securing the jobs performance such as with letters of credit or cash.\nMany of our contracts can be cancelled or delayed or may not be renewed upon completion.\nIf our customers should cancel or delay many projects, our revenues could be reduced if we are unable to replace these contracts with others. Also, we have contracts that expire and are renewed periodically. If we are unsuccessful in renewing those contracts, that could reduce our revenue as well.\nOur business requires a skilled labor force and if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our ability to maintain our productivity could be impaired.\nOur productivity depends upon our ability to employ and maintain skilled personnel to meet our requirements. Should some of our key managers leave the Company, it could limit our productivity. Also, many of our labor personnel are trade union members. Should we encounter labor problems associated with our union employees or if we are unable to employ enough available operators, welders, or other skilled labor, our production could be significantly curtailed.\nOur backlog may not be realized.\nOur backlog could be reduced due to cancellation of projects by customers and/or reductions in scope of the projects. Should this occur, our anticipated revenues would be reduced unless we are able to replace those contracts.\nWe extend credit to customers for purchases of our services and therefore have risk that they may not be able to repay us.\nWhile we have not had any significant problems with collections of accounts receivables historically, should there be an economic downturn our customers\u2019 ability to repay us could be compromised, and this may curtail our operations and ability to operate profitably.\nOur dependence on suppliers, subcontractors and equipment manufacturers could expose us to risk of loss in our operations.\nOn certain projects, we rely on suppliers to obtain the necessary materials and subcontractors to perform portions of our services. We also rely on equipment manufacturers to provide us with the equipment needed to conduct our operations. Any limitation on the availability of materials or equipment or failure to complete work on a timely basis by subcontractors in a quality fashion could lead to added costs and therefore lower profitability for the Company.\nRisk Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nWe have operations in multiple states and face risks related to the Coronavirus/COVID 19 global pandemic that could impact our results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of the widespread outbreak of Coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d). The outbreak of COVID-19 and other adverse public health developments will have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. These could include disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel or to complete our projects, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers or customers. Any disruption of our suppliers or customers would likely impact our operating results. In addition, the continued outbreak of COVID-19 could continue to adversely affect the economies of the states that we operate in resulting in a long-term economic downturn that could impact our operating results.\nThe SBA intends to audit the Company\u2019s PPP Loan and if the SBA disagrees with the Company\u2019s certification the Company could be subject to penalties and the return of the PPP Loan which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.\nOn April 15, 2020, the Company and subsidiaries C.J. Hughes Construction Company, Contractors Rental Corporation and Nitro Construction Services, Inc. entered into separate Paycheck Protection Program Notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d) effective April 7, 2020 with United Bank, Inc. as the lender (\u201cLender\u201d) in an aggregate principal amount of $13,139,100 pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the CARES Act (collectively, the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d). In a special meeting held on April 27, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company unanimously voted to return $3.3 million of the PPP Loan funds after discussing the financing needs of the Company and subsidiaries. The Company and subsidiaries retained $9.8 million of its PPP Loan to fund operations. The Company is in the process of applying for loan forgiveness with its Lender, with the amount which may be forgiven equal to the sum of the payroll costs, covered mortgage obligations, covered rent obligations and covered utility payments incurred by the Company during the twenty-four week period beginning on the date of first disbursement to the Company under the PPP Loan, calculated in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act. The PPP Loan may be forgiven so long as employee and compensation levels of the Company are maintained and 60% of the PPP Loan proceeds are used for payroll expenses, with the remaining 40% of the PPP Loan proceeds used for other qualifying expenses. The Company used the proceeds from the PPP Loan in accordance with the PPP Loan program.\nThe SBA has announced, in consultation with the Department of the Treasury, that it will review all loans in excess of $2 million, following the lender\u2019s submission of the borrower\u2019s loan forgiveness application. The SBA will be reviewing a borrower\u2019s required certification that current economic uncertainty makes the PPP loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the Applicant. Borrowers must make this certification in good faith, taking into account their current business activity and their ability to access other sources of liquidity sufficient to support their ongoing operations in a manner that is not significantly detrimental to the business. The SBA has noted it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith, and such a company should be prepared to demonstrate to the SBA, upon request, the basis for its certification.\nThe Company believes it meets the SBA\u2019s certification requirement based on its limited access to capital, weakened business operations and small market value as described above. The Company\u2019s shares of common stock do not trade on a national exchange. However, no assurance can be given as to the outcome of the SBA\u2019s audit of the Company\u2019s PPP Loan. The SBA could determine that the Company does not qualify in whole or in part for loan forgiveness. In addition, it is unknown what type of penalties could be assessed against the Company if the SBA disagrees with the Company\u2019s certification. The Company could be required to return its PPP Loan. Any penalties in addition to the potential return of the PPP Loan could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.\nRisk Related to our Industry\nAn economic downturn in the industries we serve could lead to less demand for our services.\nIn addition to the effects of an economic recession, there could be reductions in the industries that the Company serves. If the demand for natural gas should drop dramatically, or the demand for electrical services drops dramatically, these would in turn result in less demand for the Company\u2019s services.\nProject delays or cancellations may result in additional costs to us, reductions in revenues or the payment of liquidated damages.\nIn certain circumstances, we guarantee project completion by a scheduled acceptance date or are paid only upon achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels. Failure to meet any of these requirements could result in additional costs or penalties which could exceed the expected project profits.\nOur industry is highly competitive.\nOur industry has been and remains competitive with competitors ranging from small owner operated companies to large public companies. Within that group there may be companies with lower overhead costs that may be able to price their services at lower levels than we can. Accordingly, if that occurs, our business opportunities could be severely limited. In addition, our industry competes for energy demand with suppliers of alternative energy sources such as solar and wind.\nWe may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth.\nOur ability to generate internal growth will be affected by our ability to:\n\u00b7 Attract new customers;\n\u00b7 Expand our relationships with existing customers;\n\u00b7 Hire and maintain qualified employees;\n\u00b7 Expand geographically; and\n\u00b7 Adjust quickly to changes in our industry.\nRisk Related to Financing\nCredit facilities to fund our operations and growth might not be available.\nOur business relies heavily on having lines of credit in place to fund the various projects we are working on. Should funding not be available, or on favorable terms, it could severely curtail our operations and the ability to generate profits. Energy Services maintains a banking relationship with two regional banks and has lines of credit and borrowing facilities with these institutions. On July 30, 2020, the Company renewed its $15.0 million Operating Line of Credit (2020) with United Bank, WV. The line of credit expires on June 28, 2021. Based on covenant ratios, the Company qualifies for the first $12.5 million component but not the $2.5 million component. Based on the borrowing base calculation, the Company could borrow up to $11.1 million as of September 30, 2020. The Company had no borrowings on the line of credit, leaving $11.1 million available on the line of credit. The Company believes this line of credit will provide enough operating capital for future projects, but the Company cannot guarantee it will always have access to this line of credit in the future depending on the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nRisk Related to our Financial Performance\nRevenue and cost estimates on projects may differ from actual results.\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. While the Company believes estimates on project performance are materially correct at September 30, 2020, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.\nRisk Related to Law and Regulatory Compliance\nDuring the ordinary course of business, we may become subject to lawsuits or indemnity claims, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may in the ordinary course of business be named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, worker\u2019s compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract, property damages, civil penalties and other losses of injunctive or declaratory relief. Also, we often indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide and actions we take under our contracts with them. Because our services in certain instances may be integral to the operation and performance of our customers\u2019 infrastructure, we may become subject to lawsuits or claims for any failure of the systems we work on. While we carry insurance to protect the Company against such claims, the outcomes of any of the lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention from the business. Payments of significant amounts, even if reserved, could adversely affect our reputation, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial or reputational harm relating to occupational health and safety matters.\nOur operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace. While we are constantly monitoring our health and safety programs, our industry involves a high degree of operating risk and there can be no assurance given that we will avoid significant liability exposure and/or be precluded from working for various customers due to high incident rates.\nChanges by the government in laws regulating the industries we serve could reduce our sales volumes.\nIf the government enacts legislation that has a serious impact on the industries we serve, it could lead to the curtailment of capital projects in those industries and therefore lead to lower sales volumes for our Company.\nOur failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including those dealing with the handling and disposal of waste products, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other hazardous materials, as well as fuel storage. We also work around and under bodies of water. We invest significantly in compliance with the appropriate laws and regulations. However, if we should inadvertently cause contamination of waters or soils, liabilities for our Company relating to cleanup and remediation could be substantial and could exceed any insurance coverage we might have and result in a negative impact to the Company\u2019s ability to operate.\nRisk Related to Ownership of our Stocks\nWe have sold Units, each consisting of one share of 6.0% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A and 2,500 shares of Common Stock. If the Preferred Stock is converted to Common Stock, shareholders may experience dilution of their ownership interest.\nAs of September 30, 2013, the Company sold 140 units in a private placement to accredited investors, with an additional 10 units sold during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 for a total of 150 units. As a result of the private placement, an additional 375,000 shares of common stock were outstanding as of September 30, 2020. The Company also issued 56 shares of Preferred Stock to Marshall Reynolds, Chairman of the Board of Directors, in exchange for a debt forgiveness of $1.4 million. Mr. Reynolds did not receive any shares of common stock in this transaction. In addition, if the Company elects to allow the holders of the Preferred Stock to choose to convert their Preferred Stock into shares of common stock, we would issue an additional 3,433,333 shares of common stock, which will result in shareholders experiencing a dilution in their ownership interest.", "PERMNO": 91522, "SIC": 1623, "TIC": "ESOA"}
