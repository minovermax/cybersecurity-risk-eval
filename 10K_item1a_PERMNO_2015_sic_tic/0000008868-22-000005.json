RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information in our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto contained herein. Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial. If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur, our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the risk factors our business faces. The list below is not exhaustive, and investors should read this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in full. Some of the risks we face include:\nSummary of Risks Related to COVID-19\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our operations, manufacturing, supply chains and distribution systems, and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable negative effects associated with the pandemic. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the global economy and/or adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, it may also increase the likelihood and/or magnitude of other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nSummary of Risks Related to the Transaction\n\u2022The expected benefits from integrating our operations with Natura &Co\u2019s operations may not be achieved. Even if our respective operations are successfully integrated, we may not realize the full benefits of the Transaction, within the expected time frame, if at all.\n\u2022Third parties may alter existing contracts or relationships with us as a result of the Transaction. Any loss or distraction of our customers, employees, Representatives, suppliers, vendors, distributors, landlords, lenders, licensors, joint venture partners and other business partners, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSummary of Risks Related to Our Business Strategy\n\u2022Our ability to improve our financial and operational performance and implement our global business strategy is dependent upon a number of factors, and there can be no assurance if and when any of these initiatives will be successfully and fully executed or completed.\n\u2022We may experience difficulties, delays or unexpected costs in completing Open Up & Grow and Avon Integration and any other restructuring and cost-saving initiatives, including achieving any anticipated savings and benefits. If we are unable to realize these savings or benefits, or otherwise fail to invest in the growth initiatives, our business may be adversely affected.\n\u2022There can be no assurance that we will be able to improve revenue, margins and net income, or achieve profitable growth in the future, particularly in our largest markets and developing and emerging markets, such as Brazil, Mexico and Russia. We cannot assure that our broad-based geographic portfolio will be able to withstand an economic downturn, recession, cost or wage inflation, commodity cost pressures, economic or political instability, competitive pressures or other market pressures in one or more particular regions.\nSummary of Risks Related to Our Business Model\n\u2022We face intense competition and can make no assurances about our ability to overcome our competitive challenges. If our advertising, promotional, merchandising or other marketing strategies are not successful, if we are unable to improve our product mix and offer new products that represent technological breakthroughs and are aligned with local preferences, if we do not successfully manage the timing of new product introductions or the profitability of these efforts, if we are unable to improve the Representative experience, or if for other reasons the Representatives or end customers perceive competitors\u2019 products as having greater appeal, then our sales, results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected.\n\u2022Third-party suppliers provide, among other things, the raw materials required for our Beauty products. The loss of these suppliers, a supplier\u2019s inability to supply a raw material or a finished product or a disruption or interruption in the supply chain may adversely affect our business. We may be adversely affected by (i) fire, natural disasters, disease outbreaks or pandemics, such as COVID-19, shortages of goods, services or labor, delays in obtaining key supplies, strikes and stoppages, power shortages, failures in the systems, forest fires and deforestation, among others, where we are unable to otherwise service the affected region, (ii) significant disruptions in logistics infrastructure, and (iii) fluctuating fuel prices within our distribution network.\nSummary of Risks Related to Our International Operations\n\u2022We are subject to financial risks as a result of our international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of foreign currency restrictions. There can be no assurance that foreign currency fluctuations and restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows.\n\u2022The ongoing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia has resulted in the interruption of our operations in Ukraine for an indeterminate period and we cannot assure you that our business in Russia will not be interrupted as well. In addition, the ongoing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia has provoked strong reactions from the United States, the UK, the EU and various other countries around the world, including the imposition of severe financial and economic sanctions on Russia which could have a material adverse effect on our business in that country. Furthermore, while the precise effect of the ongoing military conflict and the sanctions on the Russian and global economies remains uncertain, should tensions continue to increase, financial markets may continue to experience significant volatility as well as economic and security consequences including, but not limited to, supply shortages of different kinds, increases in prices of commodities, including piped gas, oil and agricultural goods, significant disruptions in logistics infrastructure, telecommunications services, the risk of unavailability of information technology systems and infrastructure, among others.\n\u2022Our ability to conduct business in our international markets may be affected by economic, political, legal, tax and regulatory risks. In the event that any jurisdiction in which we operate or plan to operate imposes any new laws, regulations, restrictions and/or other barriers to entry, our ability to expand may be limited and our growth and development may be adversely affected.\nSummary of Risks Related to IT and Cybersecurity Matters\n\u2022A failure, disruption, cyberattack, other breach in the security of an IT system or infrastructure that we utilize could adversely affect our business and reputation and increase our costs. Our and our third-party service providers\u2019 data, IT systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable.\n\u2022Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential Representative or customer information or our failure or the perception by our Representatives or customers that we failed to comply with privacy laws or properly address privacy concerns could materially harm our business and standing with our Representatives and customers. We cannot provide assurance that our security measures will prevent further security breaches.\nSummary of Risks Related to Financial Matters\n\u2022Our credit ratings are below investment grade, which could limit our access to financing, affect the market price of our financing and increase financing costs. A downgrade in our credit ratings may adversely affect our access to liquidity.\n\u2022We may not effectively manage risks associated with the replacement of benchmark indices. Interest rates on our financial instruments tied to benchmark rates, as well as the expenses associated with those financial instruments, may be adversely affected.\nSummary of Risks Related to Legal Matters\n\u2022We are involved, and may become involved in the future, in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could adversely affect our financial results.\n\u2022Government reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions could harm our business or reputation. In addition, from time to time, we may conduct other investigations and reviews, the consequences of which could negatively impact our business or reputation.\nSummary of General Risk Factors\n\u2022A general economic downturn, a recession globally or in one or more of our geographic regions or markets or sudden disruption in business conditions or other challenges may adversely affect our business, our access to liquidity and capital, and our credit ratings.\n\u2022Our success depends, in part, on our key personnel. We may not be able to attract, assimilate, develop or retain qualified personnel in the future, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, including the execution of our global business strategy.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our operations, manufacturing, supply chains and distribution systems, and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable negative effects associated with the pandemic.\nPublic health officials worldwide have recommended and mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including restrictions on manufacturing, distribution, and congregating in heavily populated areas and shelter-in-place orders or similar measures. As a result, manufacturing and distribution of our products may be negatively impacted . Our suppliers have been similarly impacted by disruptions in global supply chains and climate events that hit electricity generation globally, among other events, which further affect our ability to produce and distribute. Distribution has also been impacted by certain restrictions on import and export in various countries and such restrictions may continue in the future. These restrictions have contributed to inflationary pressures in the cost of certain raw materials used in the production of essential items due to the increased demand for these inputs worldwide, which may affect our ability to procure such raw materials at similar prices as we have prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has also led to challenges in recruiting Representatives, and enrollment of Representatives will likely occur at a slower pace. Additionally, there is a general risk that our employees or other workers could be exposed to the virus and that an incident of infection at one of our sites could result in \u201clock-down\u201d measures for the whole site that could negatively impact our business.\nOur results will continue to be adversely impacted by these public health restrictions and other actions taken to contain or mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Although there have been certain improvements in the restrictive measures being adopted to contain the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is still considerable uncertainty as to whether future restrictions might be required or enforced by the authorities in the future. In particular, new variants of the virus have emerged against which existing vaccines and acquired immunity may not be effective. The extent of the continued impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and its impact on our Representatives, suppliers and employees, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. COVID-19 also poses risks that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including current or future shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity going forward. Furthermore, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks to which we are exposed, such as those relating to our high level of indebtedness and our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness.\nWe expect some negative impact on revenue and profits from COVID-19 to continue in 2022, given the emergence of novel strains and variants across the world as well as continuing difficulties in the rollout of vaccination programs worldwide, which will, in turn, result in lower cash generation from and greater costs in our activities. If the downturn is deeper or for longer than we anticipate, the Company could take certain further actions to ease the pressure of certain cash outflows, such as reducing discretionary expenditure, selling non-core assets, accessing government pandemic initiatives or arranging borrowing facilities with third-party banks and affiliate companies. Our projections indicate that we should have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations to parties other than Natura &Co and its affiliates for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of issuance of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. The Company has received an irrevocable commitment from Natura &Co Holding that it will provide sufficient financial support if and when needed to enable the Company to meet its obligations as they come due in the normal course of business for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of issuance of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. For further information see Note 1, Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nThere is uncertainty around the duration and breadth of the COVID-19 pandemic and the response to it. As a result the ultimate impact on our business, financial condition or operating results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. While we expect the impacts of COVID-19 to continue to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, we are unable to predict the extent or precise nature of these impacts at this time. If the pandemic or the resulting economic downturn continues to worsen, we could experience loss of business, which could have a material impact on our financial position and cash flows.\nIn addition, in the future, other regional and / or global outbreaks of communicable diseases may occur. If they occur, the effects that the Company will suffer may be similar or even greater than the effects it is suffering as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIf the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the global economy and/or adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, it may also increase the likelihood and/or magnitude of other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nRisks Related to the Transaction\nNow that the Transaction has been consummated, the expected benefits from integrating our operations with Natura & Co's operations may not be achieved.\nThe success of the Transaction depends, in part, on the ability of Natura &Co and its subsidiaries and businesses other than Avon (including Natura Cosm\u00e9ticos, Aesop, The Body Shop and their respective subsidiaries) and Avon to realize the expected benefits from integrating their respective operations. No assurance can be given that Natura &Co and Avon will be able to integrate their respective operations without encountering difficulties, which may include, among other things, the loss of key employees, diversion of management attention, the disruption of our respective ongoing businesses or possible inconsistencies in standards, procedures and policies. Additionally, Natura &Co and Avon may be required to make unanticipated capital expenditures or investments in order to maintain, integrate, improve or sustain our operations. Integrating our respective operations may involve additional unanticipated costs and financial risks, such as the incurrence of unexpected write-offs, the possible effect of adverse tax and accounting treatments and unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to Natura &Co or Avon. All of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Transaction.\nEven if our respective operations are successfully integrated, we may not realize the full benefits of the Transaction, including the synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities, within the expected time frame, if at all. Natura &Co and Avon continue to evaluate the estimates of synergies to be realized from the Transaction. However, the actual cost savings, the costs required to realize the cost savings and the source of the cost savings could differ materially from the estimates of Natura &Co and Avon.\nFurther, Natura &Co and Avon may not achieve the targeted operating or long-term strategic benefits of the Transaction. In addition, Natura &Co and Avon may not accelerate growth by increasing investments in digital, product innovation and brand initiatives. If Natura &Co and Avon are unable to achieve the objectives, or are not able to achieve our objectives on a timely basis, the anticipated benefits of the Transaction may not be realized fully or at all. An inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated benefits of the Transaction could have an adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Natura &Co and Avon and could limit Natura &Co\u2019s and Avon\u2019s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Transaction.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, which may adversely affect the Natura &Co and Avon integration plans and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. For further information regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, please also see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors-The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our operations, manufacturing, supply chains and distribution systems, and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable negative effects associated with the pandemic.\nThird parties may alter existing contracts or relationships with us as a result of the Transaction.\nWe have contracts with customers, employees, Representatives, suppliers, vendors, distributors, landlords, lenders, licensors, joint venture partners and other business partners. As a result of the Transaction, parties with which we have business and operational relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain\nbusiness decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships with us. Further, parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties.\nIn addition, current and prospective employees and Representatives may experience uncertainty about their roles now that the Transaction has been consummated and such uncertainty may have an effect on our corporate culture. There can be no assurance we will be able to attract and retain key talent, including senior leaders, to the same extent that we have previously been able to attract and retain employees and sales representatives. Any loss or distraction of our customers, employees, Representatives, suppliers, vendors, distributors, landlords, lenders, licensors, joint venture partners and other business partners, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows and could limit our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Transaction.\nThe combined company may not realize the cost savings, synergies and other benefits that the parties expect to achieve from the Transaction.\nThe combination of two independent companies is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, the combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of Natura &Co and Avon. The integration process may disrupt the business of either or both of the companies and, if implemented ineffectively, could preclude realization of the full benefits expected by Natura &Co and Avon from the Transaction. The failure of the combined company to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the operations of Natura &Co and Avon or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transaction could cause an interruption of the activities of the combined company and could seriously harm its results of operations. In addition, the overall integration of the two companies may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of client relationships and diversion of management\u2019s attention, and may cause the combined company\u2019s share price to decline. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:\n\u2022 coordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u2022 the potential diversion of management focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters;\n\u2022 aligning and executing the strategy of the combined company;\n\u2022 retaining existing independent beauty consultants and Sales Representatives and attracting new independent beauty consultants and Sales Representatives;\n\u2022 retaining existing customers and attracting new customers;\n\u2022 maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees;\n\u2022 integrating two unique business cultures, which may prove to be incompatible;\n\u2022 the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process;\n\u2022 consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations;\n\u2022 coordinating distribution and marketing efforts;\n\u2022 integrating information technology, communications and other systems;\n\u2022 changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022 managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company;\n\u2022 unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the Transaction; and\n\u2022 taking actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals.\nMany of these factors are out of the combined company\u2019s control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially affect the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if the operations of Natura &Co and Avon are integrated successfully, the combined company may not realize the full benefits of the Transaction, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that Natura &Co and Avon expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. As a result, we cannot assure you that the combination of Natura &Co and Avon will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the Transaction.\nThe financial analyses and projections considered by Natura &Co and Avon prior to the Transaction may not be realized.\nThe financial analyses and projections considered by Natura &Co and Avon prior to the Transaction reflected numerous estimates and assumptions that were inherently uncertain with respect to industry performance and competition, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and matters specific to Natura &Co\u2019s and Avon\u2019s businesses, including the factors entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d and/or entitled \u201cItem 3. Key Information-D. Risk Factors,\u201d all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Natura &Co\u2019s and Avon\u2019s control. There can be no assurance that the financial analyses and projections considered by Natura &Co and Avon will be realized or that actual results will not materially vary from such financial analyses and projections. In addition, since the financial projections cover multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year.\nThe consummation of the Transaction limits our ability to utilize existing US tax credits and also could be further reduced pursuant to Sections 382 and 383 of the Code if an additional ownership change occurs in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $660 million of foreign tax and other credits available to offset future income for U.S. federal tax purposes. As a result of the ownership change resulting from the Transaction the ability to use these credits has been limited to a range of approximately $108 to $178 million. Our ability to utilize such credits to offset future income could be further limited, however, if the Company undergoes an additional \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code. In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in ownership of our stock by 5% shareholders (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. If the 50 percentage points are exceeded, Section 382 establishes an annual limitation on the amount of deferred tax assets attributable to previously incurred credits that may be used to offset taxable income in future years. A number of complex rules apply in calculating this limitation, and any such limitation would depend in part on the market value of the Company at the time of the ownership change and prevailing interest rates at the time of calculation. As a result, the magnitude of any potential limitation on the use of our deferred tax assets and the effect of such limitation on the Company if an ownership change were to occur is difficult to assess. However, if all or a portion of our deferred tax assets were to become subject to this limitation, our tax liability could increase significantly and our future results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Prospectively if we were to undergo a further ownership change these remaining credits could be further reduced.\nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy\nOur success depends on our ability to improve our financial and operational performance and execute fully our global business strategy.\nOur ability to improve our financial and operational performance and implement the key initiatives of our global business strategy is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022implement Open Up & Grow and Avon Integration stabilization strategies, cost savings initiatives, restructuring and other initiatives, and achieve anticipated savings and benefits from such programs and initiatives;\n\u2022reverse declines in our market share and strengthen our brand image;\n\u2022implement appropriate pricing strategies and product mix that are more aligned with the preferences of local markets and achieve anticipated benefits from these strategies;\n\u2022reduce costs and effectively manage our cost structure, particularly selling, general and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) expenses;\n\u2022improve our business in the markets where we operate, including through improving field health;\n\u2022execute investments in information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) infrastructure and realize efficiencies across our supply chain, marketing processes, sales model and organizational structure;\n\u2022implement and continue to innovate our digital strategies, Internet platform, technology strategies and customer service initiatives, including our ability to offer a more compelling social selling experience and the roll-out of e-commerce in certain markets, especially where innovative platforms and technologies may lead to a disruption of our operations, both online and offline;\n\u2022effectively manage our outsourcing activities;\n\u2022improve our marketing and advertising, including our brochures and our social media presence;\n\u2022improve working capital, effectively manage inventory and implement initiatives to reduce inventory levels, including through our recent structural reset of inventory processes, and the potential impact on cash flows and obsolescence;\n\u2022secure financing at attractive rates, maintain appropriate capital investment, capital structure and cash flow levels and implement cash management, tax, foreign currency hedging and risk management strategies;\n\u2022reverse declines in Active Representatives and Representative satisfaction by successfully reducing campaign complexity and enhancing our sales leadership program, the Representative experience, retention and earnings potential, along with improving our brand image;\n\u2022increase the productivity of Representatives through successful implementation of segmentation, field activation programs and technology tools and enablers and other investments in the direct-selling channel;\n\u2022improve management of our businesses in developing markets, including improving local IT resources and management of local supply chains;\n\u2022increase the number of consumers served per Representative and their engagement online, as well as to reach new consumers through a combination of new brands, new businesses, new channels and pursuit of strategic opportunities such as joint ventures and alliances with other companies; and\n\u2022estimate and achieve any financial projections concerning, for example, customer demand, future revenue, profit, cash flow, and operating margin increases and maintain an effective internal control environment as a result of any challenges associated with the implementation of our various plans, strategies and initiatives.\nThere can be no assurance if and when any of these initiatives will be successfully and fully executed or completed.\nWe may experience financial and strategic difficulties and delays or unexpected costs in completing Open Up & Grow and Avon Integration and any other restructuring and cost-saving initiatives, including achieving any anticipated savings and benefits of these initiatives.\nSubsequent to the merger of Natura and Avon in January 2020, an integration plan (the \"Avon Integration\") was established to create the right global infrastructure to support the future ambitions of the Natura &Co Group while also identifying synergies and opportunities to leverage our combined strength, scale and reach. Synergies will be derived mainly from procurement, manufacturing/distribution and administrative, as well as top line synergies, primarily between Avon LATAM and Natura &Co Latin America.\nIn September 2018, we initiated a new strategy in order to return Avon to growth (\"Open Up Avon\"). The Open Up Avon strategy is integral to our ability to return Avon to growth, built around the necessity of incorporating new approaches to various elements of our business, including increased utilization of third-party providers in manufacturing and technology, seeking a better fit for purpose asset base, and an increased focus on enabling our Representatives to more easily interact with the company and achieve relevant earnings. These savings have been and are expected to continue to be achieved through restructuring actions (that have resulted, and may continue to result, in charges related to severance, contract terminations and inventory and other asset write-offs), as well as other cost-savings strategies that would not result in restructuring charges. In January 2019, we announced significant advancements in this strategy, including a structural reset of inventory processes and a reduction in global workforce.\nIn May 2020, the new leadership of Avon International refreshed our strategy (\"Open Up & Grow\") which aims to return Avon International to growth over the next three years. Open Up & Grow replaces and builds on the success of the 2018 Open Up Avon strategy in order to strengthen competitiveness through enhancing the representative experience, improving brand position and relevance, accelerating digital expansion and improving costs. Over the next three years, savings are expected to continue to be achieved through restructuring actions (that may continue to result in charges related to severance, contract terminations and asset write-offs), as well as other cost-savings strategies that would not result in restructuring charges.\nAs we work to right-size our cost structure, we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from one or more of the various restructuring and cost-saving initiatives we may undertake as part of these efforts in full or in part or within the time periods we expect. Other events and circumstances, such as financial and strategic difficulties and delays or unexpected costs, including the impact of foreign currency and inflationary pressures, may occur which could result in our not realizing our targets or in offsetting the financial benefits of reaching those targets. If we are unable to realize these savings or benefits, or otherwise fail to invest in the growth initiatives, our business may be adversely affected. In addition, any plans to invest these savings and benefits ahead of future growth means that such costs will be incurred whether or not we realize these savings and benefits. We are also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with these initiatives, and the failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from such initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to improve revenue, margins and net income or achieve profitable growth.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to improve revenue, margins and net income, or achieve profitable growth in the future, particularly in our largest markets and developing and emerging markets, such as Brazil, Mexico and Russia. Our revenue in 2021 was $3,404.5 million, compared with $3,625.2 million in 2020, and $4,763.2 million in 2019. Improving revenue, margins and net income and achieving profitable growth will depend on our ability to improve financial and operational performance and execute our global business strategy, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these goals. Our ability to improve could be hindered by competing business priorities and projects.\nTo improve revenue, margins and net income and achieve profitable growth, we also need to successfully implement certain initiatives, including Open Up & Grow and Avon Integration, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. Our achievement of profitable growth is also subject to the strengths and weaknesses of our individual international markets, which are or may be impacted by global economic conditions. We cannot assure that our broad-based geographic portfolio will be able to withstand an economic downturn, recession, cost or wage inflation, commodity cost pressures, economic or political instability (including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates), competitive pressures or other market pressures in one or more particular regions.\nFailure to improve revenue, margins and net income and to achieve profitable growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is conducted primarily in one channel, direct selling, and our inability to retain our Representatives may materially adversely affect us\nOur business is conducted primarily in the direct-selling channel. Sales are made to the ultimate consumer principally through direct selling by Representatives, who are independent contractors and not our employees. As of December 31, 2021, we had an average of approximately 4 million Active Representatives, which represents the number of Representatives submitting an order in a sales campaign, totaled for all campaigns during the year and then divided by the number of campaigns. There is a high rate of turnover among Representatives, which is a common characteristic of the direct-selling business. In order to reverse losses of Representatives and grow our business in the future, we need to recruit, retain and service Representatives on a continuing basis. Among other things, we need to create attractive Representative earning opportunities and transform the value chain, restore field health and sales force effectiveness, successfully implement other initiatives in the direct-selling channel, with a strategy to expand to omnichannel successfully execute our digital strategy, including e-commerce, improve our brochure and product offerings and improve our marketing and advertising. If we are unable to constantly update our product portfolio, our ability to retain our representatives could be materially adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these objectives.\nOur direct-selling model contains an inherent risk of bad debt associated with providing Representatives with credit, which is exacerbated if the financial condition of the Representatives deteriorates. Additionally, consumer purchasing habits, including reducing purchases of beauty and related products generally, or reducing purchases from Representatives through direct selling by buying beauty and related products in other channels such as retail, could reduce our sales, impact our ability to execute our global business strategy or have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, if we lose market share in the direct-selling channel, our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, if any government or regulatory body such as Brazil or the European Union, bans or severely restricts our business methods or operational/commercial model of direct selling, our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected. We may also be adversely affected by laws or regulations in the countries in which we operate that would characterize representatives as employees or otherwise oblige us to make social security contributions on their behalf.\nOur ability to improve our financial performance depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences.\nOur ability to improve our financial performance depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and effective manner to changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences for beauty and related products. We must continually work to develop, produce and market new products, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a favorable mix of products, and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products. Consumer preferences and trends may change due to a variety of factors, such as changes in demographic trends, changes in the characteristics and ingredients of products, new market trends, climate, negative publicity from lawsuits against us or our peers, or a weak economy in one or\nmore of the markets in which we operate. In addition, consumers may switch to the products of competitors, or the demand for products in our segment as a whole could decline. If we are unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nFurthermore, material shifts or decreases in market demand for our products, including as a result of changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences or incorrect forecasting of market demand, could result in us carrying inventory that cannot be sold at anticipated prices or increased product returns by the Representatives. Failure to maintain proper inventory levels or increased product returns by the Representatives could result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business Model\nWe face intense competition and can make no assurances about our ability to overcome our competitive challenges.\nWe face intense competition from competing products in each of our lines of business in the markets in which we operate. We compete against products sold to consumers in a number of distribution methods, including direct selling, through the Internet, and through mass market retail and prestige retail channels. We also face increasing direct-selling and retail competition in our developing and emerging markets, particularly Brazil and Russia.\nWithin the direct-selling channel, we often compete on country-by-country basis with our direct-selling competitors. There are a number of direct-selling companies that sell product lines similar to ours, some of which have worldwide operations and compete with us globally. Unlike a typical CPG company which operates within a broad-based consumer pool, direct sellers compete for representative or entrepreneurial talent by providing a more competitive earnings opportunity or \u201cbetter deal\u201d than that offered by the competition. Providing a compelling earnings opportunity for the Representatives is as critical as developing and marketing new and innovative products. Therefore, in contrast to typical CPG companies, we must first compete for a limited pool of Representatives before we reach the ultimate consumer.\nRepresentatives are attracted to a direct seller by competitive earnings opportunities, often through what are commonly known as \u201cfield incentives\u201d in the direct-selling industry. Competitors devote substantial effort to finding out the effectiveness of such incentives so that they can invest in incentives that are the most cost-effective or produce the better payback. As one of the largest and oldest beauty direct sellers globally, Avon's business model and strategies are often highly sought after, particularly by smaller and more nimble competitors who seek to capitalize on our investment and experience. As a result, we are subject to significant competition for the recruitment of Representatives from other direct-selling or network marketing organizations as well as significant competition from other non-direct selling earnings opportunities of which our existing Representatives or potential Representatives could avail themselves. Changes to our compensation models are sometimes necessary to be competitive but could have short-term negative impacts on our total number of Representatives. It is therefore continually necessary to innovate and enhance our direct-selling and service model as well as to recruit and retain new Representatives. If we are unable to do so, our business will be adversely affected.\nWithin the broader CPG industry, we principally compete against large and well-known cosmetics (color), fragrance and skincare companies that manufacture and sell broad product lines through various types of retail establishments and other channels, including through the Internet. In addition, we compete against many other companies that manufacture and sell more narrow beauty product lines sold through retail establishments and other channels, including through the Internet. This industry is highly competitive, and some of our principal competitors in the CPG industry are larger than we are and have greater resources than we do. Competitive activities on their part could cause our sales to suffer. We also have many highly competitive global branded and private label competitors in the accessories, apparel, housewares, and gift and decorative products industries, including retail establishments, principally department stores, mass merchandisers, gift shops and specialty retailers. Our principal competition in the highly competitive fashion jewelry industry consists of a few large companies and many small companies that sell fashion jewelry through department stores, mass merchandisers, specialty retailers and e-commerce.\nThe number of competitors and degree of competition that we face in the beauty and related products industry varies widely from country to country. If our advertising, promotional, merchandising or other marketing strategies are not successful, if we are unable to improve our product mix and offer new products that represent technological breakthroughs and are aligned with local preferences, if we do not successfully manage the timing of new product introductions or the profitability of these efforts, if we are unable to improve the Representative experience, or if for other reasons the Representatives or end customers perceive competitors' products as having greater appeal, then our sales, results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected.\nThird-party suppliers provide, among other things, the raw materials required for our Beauty products, and the loss of these suppliers, a supplier's inability to supply a raw material or a finished product or a disruption or interruption in the supply chain may adversely affect our business.\nWe manufacture and package the majority of our Beauty products, which are formulated and designed by our staff of chemists, designers and artists. Raw materials, consisting chiefly of essential oils, chemicals, containers and packaging components required for our Beauty products are purchased from a range of third-party suppliers. The remainder of our Beauty products and all of our Fashion & Home products are purchased from various third-party manufacturers. Our products are affected by the cost and availability of materials such as glass, fragrance and fuel. For the vast majority of items we have more than one source of supply available. We believe that we can continue to obtain sufficient raw materials and supplies to manufacture and produce our Beauty products for the foreseeable future. Additionally, we design the brochures that are used by the Representatives to sell our products. The brochures are then produced on our behalf by a range of printing suppliers.\nThe loss of any one supplier would not have a material impact on our ability to source raw materials for the majority of our Beauty products or source products for the remainder of our Beauty products and all of our Fashion & Home products or paper for the brochures. This risk may be exacerbated by our globally coordinated purchasing strategy, which leverages volumes. Regulatory action, such as restrictions on importation, may also disrupt or interrupt our supply chain. Furthermore, increases in the costs of raw materials or other commodities, restricted supply or, in a worst-case scenario, the impossibility of obtaining raw materials and packaging due to several factors over which we have no control, such as climate, agricultural production, legitimate access to genetic heritage and/or traditional associated knowledge, economic conditions, and transportation and processing costs, among others may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution, and may adversely affect our business if we are unable to satisfy demand for certain products or to produce paper brochures that our Representatives can use to sell our products. Moreover, if our suppliers fail to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations, such as any child labor laws and other human rights laws, our reputation could be harmed due to negative publicity and our ability to supply certain products may be disrupted.\nIn addition, our business depends on a supply chain facing inherent logistics-related risks beyond our control and that of our suppliers, such as ocean freight disruptions, which have negatively impacted us and may continue to adversely affect us in the future. We may be adversely affected in the event of (i) fire, natural disasters, disease outbreaks or pandemics, such as COVID-19, shortages of goods, services or labor, delays in obtaining key supplies, strikes and stoppages, power shortages, failures in the systems, forest fires and deforestation, among others, where we are unable to otherwise service the affected region, (ii) significant disruptions in logistics infrastructure, and (iii) fluctuating fuel prices within our distribution network.\nThe loss of, or a disruption in, our research and development, production and distribution operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur principal properties consist of worldwide manufacturing facilities for the production of Beauty products, distribution centers where offices are located and where finished merchandise is packed and shipped to Representatives in fulfillment of their orders, and one principal research and development facility. Additionally, we use third-party manufacturers to manufacture certain of our products. Therefore, as a company engaged in manufacturing, distribution and research and development on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, fires, strikes and other labor or industrial disputes, disruptions in logistics or information systems (such as our ERP system), loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites, product quality control issues, safety concerns, licensing requirements and other regulatory or government issues, as well as natural disasters, pandemics, border disputes, acts of terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. We could also experience a negative financial impact if we do not comply with minimum purchase commitments. These risks may be exacerbated by our efforts to increase facility consolidation covering our manufacturing, distribution and supply footprints, particularly if we are unable to successfully increase our resiliency to potential operational disruptions or enhance our disaster recovery planning. The loss of, or damage to, any of our facilities or centers, or those of our third-party manufacturers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality, safety and efficacy of our products.\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality, safety and efficacy of our products. If our products are found to be, or perceived to be, defective or unsafe, or if they otherwise fail to meet the Representatives\u2019 or end customers\u2019 standards, then our relationship with the Representatives or end customers could suffer, particularly where the impact of media coverage and new technologies such as social media may exert negative influence over perception of our products. We may need to recall some of our products and/or become subject to regulatory action, our reputation or the appeal of our brand could be diminished, we could lose market\nshare, and we could become subject to liability claims, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nWe are subject to financial risks as a result of our international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of foreign currency restrictions.\nWe operate globally, through operations in various locations around the world, and derive all of our consolidated revenue from operations outside of the U.S.\nOne risk associated with our international operations is that the functional currency for most of our international operations is their local currency. The primary foreign currencies for which we have significant exposures include the Argentine peso, Brazilian real, British pound, Chilean peso, Colombian peso, euro, Mexican peso, Peruvian new sol, Philippine peso, Polish zloty, Romanian leu, Russian ruble, South African rand, Turkish lira and Ukrainian hryvnia. As the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to our foreign currencies, our revenues and profits are reduced when translated into U.S. dollars and our margins may be negatively impacted by country mix if our higher-margin markets experience significant devaluation. In addition, our costs are more weighted to U.S. dollars while our sales are denominated in local currencies. Although we typically work to mitigate this negative foreign currency transaction impact through price increases and further actions to reduce costs, and by shifting costs to markets in which we generate revenue, we may not be able to fully offset the impact, if at all. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage these various foreign currency impacts and there can be no assurance that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows.\nAnother risk associated with our international operations is the possibility that a foreign government may tax or impose foreign currency remittance restrictions. Due to the possibility of government restrictions on transfers of cash out of the country and control of exchange rates, we may not be able to immediately repatriate cash. If this should occur, or if the exchange rates devalue, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows.\nInflation is another risk associated with our international operations. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings. High rates of inflation or the related devaluation of foreign currency may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations or cash flows. For example, Argentina is considered to be a highly inflationary economy. See \u201cSegment Review - Avon Latin America\u201d within MD&A for additional information regarding Argentina. Brazil has also experienced a significant rise in inflation in 2021 and early 2022. Moreover, governmental measures to curb inflation and speculation about any such possible future governmental measures have contributed to the negative economic impact of inflation and have created general economic uncertainty and heightened volatility in the capital markets. In addition, there can be no assurance that other countries in which we operate will not become highly inflationary and that our revenue, operating profit and net income will not be adversely impacted as a result.\nOur ability to conduct business in our international markets may be affected by economic, political, legal, tax and regulatory risks.\nA significant deterioration in economic conditions in any of our important markets, including economic slowdowns or recessions, inflationary pressures and/or disruptions to credit and capital markets, could lead to decreased consumer confidence and consumer spending more generally, thus reducing demand for our products. In addition, our global operations are subject to adverse political, social or other developments, such as political or social unrest, potential health issues, natural disasters, disease outbreaks or pandemics, such as COVID-19, politically motivated violence and terrorist threats and/or act which may also occur in countries where we have operations.\nIn particular, our ability to achieve growth in our international markets, and to improve operations in our existing international markets, is exposed to various risks, including:\n\u2022the possibility that a foreign government might ban, halt or severely restrict our business, including our primary method of direct selling;\n\u2022the possibility that local civil unrest, economic or political instability, bureaucratic delays, changes in macro-economic conditions, changes in diplomatic or trade relationships (including any sanctions, restrictions and other responses, such as those related to the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine) or other uncertainties might disrupt our operations in an international market;\n\u2022the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems in certain areas where we operate;\n\u2022the adoption of new U.S. or foreign tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities, including exposure to tax assessments without prior notice or the opportunity to review the basis for any such assessments in certain jurisdictions;\n\u2022changes to tax rules in Brazil, where the tax system is highly complex and the interpretation of the tax laws and regulations is commonly controversial, and the Brazilian government regularly implements changes to tax regimes that may increase our tax burden, including modifications in the rate of assessments and the enactment of new or temporary taxes, the proceeds of which are earmarked for designated governmental purposes;\n\u2022electoral pressures in 2022 in Brazil, whereas, historically, in presidential election years, foreign investments in Brazil decrease and political uncertainty generates greater instability and volatility in the domestic market;\n\u2022the possibility that a government authority might impose legal, tax or other financial burdens on the Representatives, as direct sellers, or on Avon, due, for example, to the structure of our operations in various markets, or additional taxes on our products, including in Brazil;\n\u2022the possibility that a government authority might challenge the status of the Representatives as independent contractors or impose employment or social taxes on the Representatives; and\n\u2022those associated with data privacy regulation and the international transfer of personal data.\nWe are also subject to the adoption, interpretation and enforcement by governmental agencies abroad and in the U.S. (including on federal, state and local levels) of other laws, rules, regulations or policies, including any changes thereto, such as restrictions on trade, competition, manufacturing, license and permit requirements, import and export license requirements, privacy and data protection laws, anti-trust laws, anti-corruption laws, environmental laws, records and information management, tariffs and taxes, laws relating to the sourcing of \"conflict minerals,\" health care reform requirements such as those required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Healthcare Act, and regulation of our brochures, product claims or ingredients, which may require us to adjust our operations and systems in certain markets where we do business. For example, from time to time, local governments and others question the legal status of Representatives or impose burdens inconsistent with the Representative's status as independent contractors, often in regard to possible coverage under social benefit laws that would require us (and, in most instances, the Representatives) to make regular contributions to government social benefit funds.\nAt the end of 2021 and into 2022, Russia amassed large numbers of military forces and support personnel on the Ukraine-Russia border, leading to tensions between Ukraine and Russia as well as between the United States, its allies and Russia. On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a military invasion of Ukraine. As a result of these developments, our Ukrainian operations are currently suspended for an indeterminate period [and we cannot assure you that our Russian operations will not also be reduced or suspended.] Furthermore, the ongoing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia has resulted in the imposition of broad financial and economic sanctions against Russia by the United States and its allies, including the UK, the EU and other countries around the world, which could have a lasting impact on regional and global economies. Any further escalation of the military conflict between Ukraine and Russia, or any further increase in tensions between the United States, its allies and Russia could have a material adverse effect on us. See also \u201c-The ongoing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d\nIf we are unable to address these matters in a satisfactory manner, or adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements, our business, costs and/or reputation may be adversely affected. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome or the impact that pending or future legislative and regulatory changes may have on our business in the future. Further, in the event that any jurisdiction in which we operate or plan to operate imposes any new laws, regulations, restrictions and/or other barriers to entry, our ability to expand may be thereby limited and our growth and development may be adversely affected.\nThe ongoing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia launched a military invasion of Ukraine. The ongoing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia has provoked strong reactions from the United States, the UK, the EU and various other countries around the world, including the imposition of broad financial and economic sanctions against Russia.\nWe have sales operations in multiple countries including in Russia and Ukraine. While as of the date of this report there have not been any material impacts from the above mentioned matter in our consolidated financial statements, we are continuously monitoring the developments to assess any potential future impacts that may arise as a result of the ongoing crisis .\nWhile the precise effects of the ongoing military conflict and these sanctions on the Russian and global economies remain uncertain, they have already resulted in significant volatility in financial markets, depreciation of the Russian ruble and the Ukrainian hryvnia against the U.S. dollar, as well as in an increase in energy and commodity prices globally. Should the\nconflict continue or escalate, markets may face various economic and security consequences including, but not limited to, supply shortages of different kinds, further increases in prices of commodities, including piped gas, oil and agricultural goods, reduced consumer purchasing power, significant disruptions in logistics infrastructure, telecommunications services, the risk of unavailability of information technology systems and infrastructure, among others, given that Russia and Ukraine are significant exporters of commodities. The resulting impacts on financial markets, inflation, interest rates, unemployment and other matters could disrupt the global economy\u2019s ongoing recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic. Other potential consequences include, but are not limited to, growth in the number of popular uprisings in the region, increased political discontent, especially in the regions most affected by the conflict or economic sanctions, increase in cyberterrorism activities and attacks, displacement of persons to regions close to the areas of conflict and an increase in the number of refugees fleeing across Europe, among other unforeseen social and humanitarian effects.\nA protracted conflict between Ukraine and Russia, any escalation of that conflict, and the financial and economic sanctions and import and/or export controls imposed on Russia by the United States, the UK, the EU and others, and the above mentioned adverse effect on the wider global economy and market conditions could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to a number of foreign laws and regulations in various jurisdictions governing data privacy and security.\nWe collect, use and store personal data of our employees, Representatives, customers and other third parties in the ordinary course of business. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy and security laws and regulations governing the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other data, including the transfer of personal data between countries. In May 2018, the EU adopted robust data privacy regulations under the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d). Further changes are likely to be introduced through a revised Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the \u201cePrivacy Regulation\u201d). The GDPR in particular has broad extraterritorial effect and imposes a robust data protection compliance regime with significant penalties for non-compliance. Other countries in which we operate are developing comparable regulations. Brazil enacted the Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais (\u201cLGPD\u201d), which is broadly equivalent to GDPR and came into force in September 2020, except for the applicability of the law\u2019s administrative sanctions, which came into force on August 1, 2021. In general, the GDPR and ePrivacy Regulation, and other local privacy laws, could require adaptation of our technologies or practices to satisfy local privacy requirements and standards. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could result in the issuance of stop processing orders, and/or subject us to fines and penalties. That or other circumstances related to our collection, use and transfer of personal data could cause a loss of reputation in the market or adversely affect our business.\nThe scope of data privacy and security regulations continues to evolve, and we believe that the adoption of increasingly restrictive regulations in this area may be likely within the jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance with data privacy and security requirements could increase the cost of our operations and failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to business disruption, criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the UK's decision to withdraw from the EU may adversely affect our business.\nOn June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d As a result of the referendum, the UK parliament voted in March 2017 to trigger Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, commencing the UK\u2019s official withdrawal process from the EU and initiating negotiations with the EU in June 2017. In January 2020, the House of Commons (the lower chamber of the UK parliament) approved the terms of an agreement with the EU to determine the future terms of the parties\u2019 relationship, including the terms of trade between the UK and the EU and other nations, following the UK\u2019s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020.\nThe UK left the EU on January 31, 2020. A transition period, lasting until December 31, 2020, was put in place, during which the UK continued to (i) be subject to EU rules and (ii) remain a member of the single market. The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (\u201cTCA\u201d) was signed on 30 December 2020, between the EU, the European Atomic Energy Community and the UK. It has been applied provisionally since 1 January 2021, when the transition period ended, and came into full force on May 1, 2021, after relevant EU institutions ratified the agreement. This trade agreement, in which there will be no tariffs or quotas on the movement of goods between UK and EU, means the UK has left the EU customs union and single market. While the TCA between the UK and EU provided much needed certainty on trade, naturally political and economic concerns remain as the true effects of the TCA and future trade agreements outside of the EU begin to unfold, which developments we continue to monitor.\nContinued uncertainty around the terms of the UK\u2019s relationship with the European Union and the lack of a fully comprehensive trade agreement may negatively impact the economic growth of both regions. Similarly, an adverse effect on the\nUK and the EU may have an adverse effect on the wider global economy or market conditions and investor confidence. This could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and prospects.\nFurthermore, given that we conduct a substantial portion of our business in the EU and the UK, and our corporate headquarters has been relocated to the UK, any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity and results of operations or cash flows. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a material effect on our net sales, financial condition, profitability and/or cash flows and may reduce the reported value of our operating results.\nDuring 2022 we will continue to monitor the implementation of new border controls (including any resulting delays), immigration policy (ability to recruit and maintain talent), regulatory changes and requirements to comply with new mandates, which may prove challenging and costly.\nRisks Related to IT and Cybersecurity Matters\nA failure, disruption, cyberattack, other breach in the security of an IT system or infrastructure that we utilize could adversely affect our business and reputation and increase our costs.\nWe employ IT systems to support our business, including systems to support financial reporting, web-based tools, enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) systems, and internal communication and data transfer networks. We increasingly rely on a variety of web-based systems and mobile applications to support Representatives in our markets, including electronic order collection, invoicing systems, shipping and box packing, social media tools, Representative recruitment and online training. We also have e-commerce sites to allow customers to purchase products directly. We use third-party service providers in many instances to provide or support these IT systems. Over the last several years, we have undertaken initiatives to increase our reliance on IT systems which has resulted in the outsourcing of certain services and functions, such as global human resources IT systems, call center support, Representative support services and other IT processes. Our IT systems and infrastructure, as well as the systems, infrastructure and services of those of third parties, are integral to our performance.\nAny of our IT systems and infrastructure, or those of our third-party service providers, may be susceptible to outages, disruptions, destruction or corruption due to the complex landscape of localized applications and architectures as well as incidents related to legacy or unintegrated systems. These IT systems and infrastructure also may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches, attacks, computer viruses, break-ins, including ransomware, other malware and phishing attacks, data corruption, fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events beyond our control. We rely on our employees, Representatives and third parties in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error or malfeasance or failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach of third-party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk. Furthermore, our ability to protect and monitor the practices of our third-party service providers is more limited than our ability to protect and monitor our own IT systems and infrastructure.\nMoreover, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have increased the number of employees working remotely and expect to continue to allow remote work even after the pandemic comes to an end. This will require us to continue relying on remote-access information technology systems, which increases the risk of unavailability of our systems and infrastructure, disruption of telecommunications services, widespread system failures, and exposes us to increased vulnerability to cyberattacks. Any of these developments could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business may be adversely impacted.\nOur IT systems, or those of our third-party service providers may be accessed by unauthorized users such as cyber criminals as a result of a failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach, exposing us to risk. As techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, a failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach may go undetected for a long period of time. An actual or perceived failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach of our IT systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party service providers, could result in the theft, transfer, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of Company, employee, Representative, customer, vendor, or other third-party data, including sensitive or confidential data, personal information and intellectual property and could be particularly harmful to our brand and reputation.\nWe continue to invest in industry-standard solutions and protections and monitoring practices of our data and IT systems and infrastructure to reduce these risks and we continue to monitor our IT systems and infrastructure on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. We have also deployed additional employee security training and updated security policies for the Company and its third-party service providers. Such efforts and investments are costly, and as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. As a company that operates globally, we could also be impacted by commercial agreements between us and processing organizations, existing and proposed laws and regulations, and government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection.\nDespite our efforts, our and our third-party service providers\u2019 data, IT systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable. There can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent a failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach of our or our third-party service providers\u2019 IT systems or infrastructure, or that we will detect and appropriately respond if there is such a failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach. Our IT databases and systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to ransomware, denial of service and phishing attacks. Any such failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach could adversely affect our business including our ability to expand our business, cause damage to our reputation, result in increased costs to address internal data, security, and personnel issues, and result in violations of applicable privacy laws and other laws and external financial obligations such as governmental fines, penalties, or regulatory proceedings, remediation efforts such as breach notification and identity theft monitoring, and third-party private litigation with potentially significant costs. In addition, it could result in deterioration in our employees', Representatives', customers', or vendors' confidence in us, which could cause them to discontinue doing business with us or result in other competitive disadvantages. In addition, there may be other challenges and risks as we upgrade, modernize, and standardize our IT systems globally.\nSee also \u201c-We were the target of a cybersecurity incident which disrupted our systems.\u201d\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential Representative or customer information or our failure or the perception by our Representatives or customers that we failed to comply with privacy laws or properly address privacy concerns could materially harm our business and standing with our Representatives and customers.\nWe collect, store, process, transmit and use certain personal information in the ordinary course of our business. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy and security laws and regulations governing personal information and other data, including the transfer of personal data between countries. We may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could result in the issuance of stop processing orders, subject us to fines, penalties or orders to cease, delay or modify collection, use or transfer of personal data. The perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may adversely affect us. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential Representative and customer information.\nOur facilities and systems, as well as those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, fraud, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors, or other similar events. Any security breach, or any perceived failure involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, as well as any failure or perceived failure to comply with laws, policies, legal obligations or industry standards regarding data privacy and protection, whether by us or vendors upon whose systems we rely, could damage our reputation, expose us to litigation risk and liability, reduce revenue, increase costs, subject us to negative publicity, disrupt our operations and harm our business. We cannot provide assurance that our security measures will prevent security breaches or that failure to prevent them will not have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe were the target of a cybersecurity incident which disrupted our systems.\nIn June 2020, we became aware that we were exposed to a cyber incident in our Information Technology (IT) environment which interrupted some of our systems and partially affected our operations. We engaged leading external cybersecurity and IT general controls specialists, launched a comprehensive containment and remediation effort and started a forensic investigation. By mid-August 2020, the Company had re-established all of its core business processes and resumed operations in all of its markets, including all of its distribution centers.\nThe cyber incident did not have a material impact on our full year 2020 revenue, although it resulted in a shift in revenue from the second quarter to the third quarter of 2020 as the Company fulfilled the order backlog created. The incremental expense incurred as a result of the cyber incident was not material.\nManagement concluded that controls related to our IT environment had not been designed and/or operated effectively to prevent access and changes to our IT systems supporting financial information processing. Although we had no indication that the accuracy and completeness of any financial information was impacted as a result of the incident, and we performed extensive procedures immediately after discovering the incident to validate such accuracy and completeness, we believed that, if the incident had gone differently, it could have potentially resulted in a material impact to our financial statements, which led to the conclusion that the magnitude of these control deficiencies represented a material weakness in our IT general controls.\nTo remediate the material weakness, we strengthened procedures and controls with the support of external cyber security and IT general controls specialists and accelerated our investment in IT infrastructure to strengthen our cyber security controls. Based on testing performed by management, the implemented controls are designed and operating effectively and the material weakness was remediated at December 31, 2020.\nAs a result of the incident, we may be subject to litigation and investigations by regulators in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We may incur losses associated with potential claims by third parties or individuals, as well as fines, penalties and other sanctions imposed by regulators relating to or arising from the incident. We may also incur contingencies related to the incident. We are not able to reliably forecast all of the losses that may occur as a result of the incident, and such excess losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nFollowing the incident, we have taken certain additional preventative measures to reduce cyber risks. However, we cannot provide assurance that our security frameworks and measures will be successful in preventing future cybersecurity incidents. In addition, the costs of such measures and management attention required may be significant. Further, the incident may have a negative impact on our reputation and cause customers, suppliers and other third parties with whom we maintain relationships to lose confidence in us. We are unable to definitively determine the impact to these relationships and whether we will need to engage in any activities to rebuild them.\nRisks Related to Financial Matters\nOur credit ratings are below investment grade, which could limit our access to financing, affect the market price of our financing and increase financing costs. A downgrade in our credit ratings may adversely affect our access to liquidity.\nOur long-term credit ratings are: Moody\u2019s ratings of Ba3 with Stable Outlook for corporate family and senior unsecured debt; S&P ratings of BB with Stable Outlook for corporate family and senior unsecured debt; and Fitch ratings of BB with Positive Outlook for corporate family and unsecured debt. Our credit ratings remain below investment grade which may impact our ability to access financing transactions on favorable terms. We do not believe these long-term credit ratings will have a material impact on our near-term liquidity. However, any rating agency review could result in a change in outlook or downgrade, which could limit our access to new financing, reduce our flexibility with respect to working capital needs, affect the market price of some or all of our outstanding debt securities and could result in an increase in financing costs. See Note 7, Debt and Other Financing to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, for details about the terms of our existing debt and other financing arrangements.\nWe may not effectively manage risks associated with the replacement of benchmark indices.\nInterest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be \u201cbenchmarks\u201d are the subject of increased regulatory scrutiny. In March 2021, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, or the \u201cFCA,\u201d announced that most London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) benchmarks will cease to be available after 2021. Certain other alternative benchmark interest rates have been announced, such as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s Secured Overnight Financing Rate based on overnight U.S. Treasury repurchase agreement transactions, which has been recommended as the alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nThese and other reforms may cause benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences that cannot be fully anticipated, which introduces a number of risks for us including legal risks arising from potential changes required to documentation for new and existing transactions. Meaningful time and effort is required to transition to the use of new benchmark rates, including with respect to the negotiation and implementation of any necessary changes to existing contractual arrangements and the implementation of changes to our systems and processes. We are actively evaluating the operational and other impacts of such changes and managing transition efforts accordingly.\nMoreover, there is a lack of clarity as to what methods of calculating a replacement benchmark will be established or adopted generally, or whether different industry bodies, such as the loan market and the derivatives market, will adopt the same methodologies. In addition, as part of the transition to a replacement benchmark, parties may seek to adjust the spreads relative to such benchmarks in underlying contractual arrangements. As a result, interest rates on financial instruments tied to benchmark rates, including those pursuant to which we borrow funds, as well as the expenses associated with those financial instruments, may be adversely affected.\nSignificant changes in pension fund investment performance, assumptions relating to pension costs or required legal changes in pension funding rules may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations, the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost.\nOur funding policy for pension plans is to meet the minimum required contributions under applicable law and accumulate plan assets that, over the long run, are expected to approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations. Our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations, the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets, including equity and debt securities and derivative instruments, or in a change of the expected rate of\nreturn on plan assets. A change in the discount rate could result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations, affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years. Similarly, changes in the expected rate of return on plan assets can result in significant changes in the net periodic pension cost. Please see \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates - Pension and Postretirement Expense\u201d within MD&A and Note 13, Employee Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, for additional information regarding the impact of these factors on our pension plan obligations.\nRisks Related to Legal Matters\nWe are involved, and may become involved in the future, in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are, and may in the future become, party to litigation, including, for example, claims alleging violation of the federal securities laws or claims relating to employee or employment matters, our products or advertising. In general, litigation claims can be expensive and time-consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly affect our financial results and the conduct of our business. We are currently vigorously contesting certain of these litigation claims. However, it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation to which we currently are or may in the future become party, or to predict the impact of certain of these matters on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 18, Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, for a detailed discussion regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are a party.\nGovernment reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions could harm our business or reputation. In addition, from time to time, we may conduct other investigations and reviews, the consequences of which could negatively impact our business or reputation.\nAs we operate in various locations around the world, our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be harmed by the results of such scrutiny. The regulatory environment with regard to direct selling in emerging and developing markets where we do business is evolving, and government officials in such locations often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply relevant regulations. From time to time, we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities about our business and compliance with local laws and regulations. In addition, from time to time, we may conduct investigations and reviews. The consequences of such government reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions or such investigations and reviews may adversely impact our business, prospects, reputation, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows.\nAdditionally, any determination that our operations or activities, or, where local law mandates, the activities of the Representatives, including our licenses or permits, importing or exporting, or product testing or approvals are not, or were not, in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, civil and criminal penalties, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party, termination of necessary licenses and permits, modification of business practices and compliance programs, equitable remedies, including disgorgement, injunctive relief and other sanctions that we may take against our personnel or that may be taken against us or our personnel. Other legal or regulatory proceedings, as well as government investigations, which often involve complex legal issues and are subject to uncertainties, may also follow as a consequence. Further, other countries in which we do business may initiate their own investigations and impose similar sanctions. These proceedings or investigations could be costly and burdensome to our management, and could adversely impact our business, prospects, reputation, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows. Even if an inquiry or investigation does not result in any adverse determinations, it potentially could create negative publicity and give rise to third-party litigation or action.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, specifically patents and trademarks, our ability to compete could be adversely affected.\nThe market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our product innovations and our brand equity. We own the material patents and trademarks used in connection with the marketing and distribution of our major products where such products are principally sold. Although most of our material intellectual property is registered in certain countries in which we operate, there can be no assurance with respect to the rights associated with such intellectual property in those countries. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries, including many emerging markets, may not completely protect our intellectual property rights. The costs required to protect our patents and trademarks, especially in emerging markets, may be substantial. Please see \u201cThe licensing of our North America intellectual property rights, including trademarks that are fundamental to our brand, in connection with the Separation could adversely impact our reputation, our business generally, and our ability to enforce intellectual property rights used in both North America and international jurisdictions\u201d\nbelow for additional information regarding the risks on our intellectual property rights associated with the separation of North America.\nRisks Related to the Separation of North America and the Preferred Stock Investment in the Company\nWe may be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation of our North America business.\nOn March 1, 2016, Cleveland Apple Investor L.P. (\u201cCerberus Investor\u201d) (an affiliate of Cerberus) contributed $170 million of cash into New Avon in exchange for 80.1% of its membership interests, and we contributed (i) assets primarily related to our North America business (including approximately $100 million of cash, subject to certain adjustments), (ii) certain assumed liabilities (primarily pension and postretirement liabilities) of our North America business and (iii) the employees of our North America business into New Avon in exchange for a 19.9% ownership interest of New Avon (collectively, the \"Separation\"). In August 2019, we and Cerberus finalized the sale of our respective interests in New Avon to LG Household & Health Care Ltd. In connection with the Separation, we entered into a Separation Agreement and various other agreements with New Avon to govern the separation and the relationship of the two companies going forward. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us. The indemnity rights we have against New Avon under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us. In addition, our indemnity obligations to New Avon may be significant and these risks could negatively affect our financial condition.\nWe or New Avon may fail to perform under the post-closing arrangements executed in connection with the Separation.\nIn connection with the Separation, we and New Avon entered into several agreements, including among others, an Intellectual Property License Agreement and a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement. The Intellectual Property License Agreement provides New Avon with rights to use certain intellectual property rights that we used in the conduct of the North America business prior to the Separation. The Manufacturing and Supply Agreement provides that we and New Avon will manufacture, or cause to be manufactured, and supply certain products to each other. These agreements establish a bilateral relationship between New Avon and us. We will rely on New Avon to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If New Avon is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, we could incur operational difficulties or losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe licensing of our North America intellectual property rights, including trademarks that are fundamental to our brand, in connection with the Separation could adversely impact our reputation, our business generally, and our ability to enforce intellectual property rights used in both North America and international jurisdictions.\nIn connection with the Separation, we granted New Avon a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license, with the ability to sublicense, to certain intellectual property rights that we used in the conduct of our North America business prior to the Separation. The Intellectual Property License Agreement includes quality control provisions obligating New Avon and its sublicensees to remain in compliance with applicable law or, for certain of our brands, quality standards that we have provided to New Avon, when selling products under certain trademarks that we have licensed to New Avon. However, there is a risk that failure by New Avon or its sublicensees to comply with such quality control provisions or other conduct by New Avon or its sublicensees associated with the trademarks licensed to New Avon, could adversely affect our reputation and our business globally. We have also granted New Avon enforcement rights to intellectual property licensed to New Avon in certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our position and options globally relating to enforcement of our intellectual property.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nA general economic downturn, a recession globally or in one or more of our geographic regions or markets or sudden disruption in business conditions or other challenges may adversely affect our business, our access to liquidity and capital, and our credit ratings.\nCurrent global macro-economic instability or a further downturn in the economies in which we sell our products, including any recession in one or more of our geographic regions or markets could adversely affect our business, our access to liquidity and capital, and our credit ratings. Economic events, including high unemployment levels and recession, have resulted in challenges to our business and a heightened concern regarding further deterioration globally. In addition, as mentioned above, our business is conducted primarily in the direct-selling channel. We could experience declines in revenues, profitability and cash flow due to reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors caused by such economic, operational or business challenges. Any or all of these factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources and\ncredit ratings, including our ability to access short-term financing, reduce flexibility with respect to working capital, and maintain credit lines and offshore cash balances.\nConsumer spending is also generally affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, taxation, energy costs, gasoline prices and consumer confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, such as beauty and related products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products. We may face continued economic challenges in 2022 because customers may continue to have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses, bankruptcies, and reduced access to credit, among other things.\nMoreover, our results of operations and financial condition have been, and will continue to be, affected by the growth rate of the GDP of the countries in which we operate. We cannot ensure that the GDP of the countries in which we operate will increase or remain stable. Developments in the macroeconomic conditions of the countries in which we operate, including Brazil, which has been experiencing an economic slowdown since 2012, may affect such countries\u2019 growth rates and, consequently, us.\nIn addition, sudden disruptions in business conditions and consumer spending may result from acts of terror, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, and pandemic situations or large-scale power outages, none of which are under our control.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our operations, manufacturing, supply chains and distribution systems. There is uncertainty around the duration and breadth of the COVID-19 pandemic and the response to it. As a result, we cannot reasonably estimate at this time the continued impact, that COVID-19 may have on our business or operations. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact including on financial markets or otherwise. See also \"Item 1A. Risk Factors-The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our operations, manufacturing, supply chains and distribution systems, and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable negative effects associated with the pandemic.\nOur success depends, in part, on our key personnel.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to retain our key personnel. The unexpected loss of or failure to retain one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business. Our success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, attract, train, develop and retain other highly qualified personnel. Competition for these employees can be intense and our ability to hire, attract and retain them depends on our ability to provide competitive compensation. We may not be able to attract, assimilate, develop or retain qualified personnel in the future, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, including the execution of our global business strategy. Any failure by our management team to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as on our ability to address the challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the response to it. This risk may be exacerbated by the uncertainties associated with the implementation of Open Up & Grow and Avon Integration and any other stabilization strategies and restructuring and cost-saving initiatives we undertake from time to time.\nWe are not insured against all risks affecting our activities and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to\ncover all losses and/or liabilities that may be incurred by our operations.\nWe cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage will always be available or will always be sufficient to cover any damages resulting from any kind of claims. In addition, there are certain types of risks that may not be covered by our policies, such as war, force majeure or certain business interruptions. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that when our current insurance policies expire, we will be able to renew them at sufficient and favorable terms. Claims that are not covered by our policies or the failure to renew our insurance policies may materially adversely affect us.\nAny strategic alliances or divestitures may expose us to additional risks.\nWe evaluate potential strategic alliances that would complement our current product offerings, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and/or operating efficiency opportunities. Strategic alliances may entail numerous risks, including:\n\u2022substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial difficulties, including difficulties in leveraging synergies among the businesses to increase sales and obtain cost savings or achieve expected results;\n\u2022difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key employees from any acquired businesses and disruption to our direct-selling channel;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u2022adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; and\n\u2022reputational and other risks regarding our ability to successfully implement such strategic alliances, including obtaining financing which could result in an increase in our indebtedness.\nOur failure to successfully complete the integration of any new or acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate such transactions on favorable terms.\nFor divestitures, success is also dependent on effectively and efficiently separating the divested unit or business from the Company and reducing or eliminating associated overhead costs. In cases where a divestiture is not successfully implemented or completed, the Company's business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Please see \u201cRisks Related to the Separation of North America\u201d for additional information regarding the risks associated with the separation of North America.\nClimate change can create transition risks, physical risks and other risks that could adversely affect us.\nClimate risk is a transversal risk that can be an aggravating factor for the types of traditional risks that we manage in the ordinary course of business, including without limitation the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Based on the classifications used by Task-Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, we consider that there are two primary sources of climate change related financial risks: physical and transition.\nPhysical risks resulting from climate change can be event-driven (acute) or long-term shifts (chronic) in climate patterns:\n\u2022Acute physical risks include increased severity of extreme weather events, such as drought, hurricanes, or floods.\n\u2022Chronic physical risks include changes in precipitation patterns and extreme variability in weather patterns, rising mean temperatures, chronic heat waves or rising sea levels.\nTransition risks refer to actions brought on to address mitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change, and they can fall into various categories such as market, technology and market changes:\n\u2022Market risk may manifest through shifts in supply and demand for certain commodities, products, and services, as climate-related risks and opportunities are increasingly taken into account.\n\u2022Technology risk arises from improvements or innovations to support the transition to a lower-carbon, energy efficient economic system that can have a significant impact on companies to the extent that new technology displaces old systems and disrupts some parts of the existing economic system.\n\u2022Policy actions generally fall into two categories-those that attempt to constrain actions that contribute to the adverse effects of climate change and those that seek to promote adaptation to climate change. The risk associated with and the financial impact of policy changes depend on the nature and timing of the policy change.\nWe are already subject to certain regulatory environmental requirements that may increase going forward as a result of the increasing importance of environmental matters. This and other changes in regulations in international markets may expose us to increased compliance costs, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities and provide certain products and services, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 40416, "SIC": 2844, "TIC": "AVP"}
