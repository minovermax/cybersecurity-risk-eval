Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains \u201cforward-looking statements,\u201d as discussed in \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d These risk factors are important to understanding this annual report on Form 10-K, our business and our other filings with the Commission. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements in this annual report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the Commission. These are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock, preferred stock and debt could decline.\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d), and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nOur business routinely encounters and addresses risks, some of which will cause our future results to be different - sometimes materially different - than we presently anticipate. A discussion about important operational risks that our business encounters can be found in the MD&A section and in the business descriptions in Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness\u201d of this annual report on Form 10-K. Below, we describe certain important operational and strategic risks. Our reactions to material future developments as well as our competitors\u2019 reactions to those developments will affect our future results.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Preferred Stock\nFailure to repay our Notes\nThe Notes matured on Saturday, April 15, 2017, and were payable on the next business day on April 17, 2017. Because we did not have sufficient cash on hand and did not generate sufficient cash from operations or asset sales, we did not repay the Notes at their maturity. We are considering a range of options to address the repayment of the Notes as part of our strategy regarding a comprehensive recapitalization of our balance sheet, as we have summarized under Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness-Recent Developments.\u201d We face various risks in our efforts to address the repayment of the Notes, including the inherent difficulty and uncertainty in negotiations with the Noteholders, the availability of the capital markets to allow us access to fresh capital to repay the Notes on attractive terms or at all, and the potential attempt by the Series B preferred stockholders to block our refinancing efforts, among others. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in our recapitalization efforts. Our failure to repay the Notes at their maturity resulted in an event of default under the Indenture under which the Notes were issued and the Noteholders are able to exercise various remedies against us, including foreclosing on our assets that constitute collateral under the Indenture. The collateral constitutes substantially all of our assets and includes the equity of our subsidiaries that own our FCC Licenses, our contractual rights and economic interests in such FCC licenses, and a significant portion of our operating cash. In addition, we are in default under the Indenture for the reasons described under \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Notes.\u201d In the event we are unsuccessful in these efforts and one or more Noteholders seek to exercise remedies against us or our assets, we may be required to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the \u201cBankruptcy Code\u201d), among other things, in order to maximize the value of our company for all of our constituents. While we believe that a Chapter 11 filing may create an avenue to successfully execute on our recapitalization strategy, such a filing may also have several negative consequences to our business, including the costs and negative publicity that surrounds such a filing, reduced advertising revenue due to the uncertainty surrounding the filing, the potential need to sell assets (including the equity of our subsidiaries that own our FCC licenses) under distressed circumstances and the risk that we are unable to execute on a successful plan of reorganization.\nWe face several risks relating to the existence of the Voting Rights Triggering Event.\nAs a result of our not having sufficient funds legally available to repurchase our Series B preferred stock upon request on October 15, 2013, a \u201cVoting Rights Triggering Event\u201d occurred (the \u201cVoting Rights Triggering Event\u201d) under the Certificate of Designations under which the Series B preferred stock was issued. For more information regarding the Voting Rights Triggering Event, see Note 12 to our 2016 financial statements that are included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. As a result, the holders of the Series B preferred stock have the right to elect two members to our Board of Directors until that event is remedied or the Series B preferred stock is redeemed, waived or amended. These directors were elected to the Board at our Annual Meeting held on June 6, 2014. These two directors have fiduciary duties to both us and our common stockholders as well as the Series B preferred stockholders that elected them to our Board of Directors, and may or may not act primarily in the interests of the Series B preferred stockholders as opposed to the interest of all stockholders. If these directors act primarily in the interests of the Series B preferred stockholders, this could have a material adverse effect on us and our common stockholders.\nUntil the Voting Rights Triggering Event is remedied, our business is subject to significant restrictions, unless such restrictions are waived or amended or our Series B preferred stock is refinanced on different terms. Waiving or amending the restrictions described below would require the consent of each holder of Series B preferred stock affected. Under these restrictions, among other things:\n\u2022\nwe are unable to incur any indebtedness, including indebtedness to refinance the Notes; and\n\u2022\nour ability to make investments or make restricted payments is significantly limited.\nOur ability to undertake certain mergers and consolidations requires the approval of a majority of the shares of the then outstanding Series B preferred stock, provided that, after such merger or consolidation no Voting Rights Triggering has occurred or is continuing.\nThese restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to refinance the Notes and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Voting Rights Triggering Event continues until (i) all dividends in arrears shall have been paid in full and (ii) all other failures, breaches or defaults giving rise to such Voting Rights Triggering Event are remedied or waived by the holders of at least a majority of the shares of the then outstanding Series B preferred stock. We do not currently have sufficient funds legally available to be able to satisfy the conditions for terminating the Voting Rights Triggering Event.\nIn addition, we face the risk of litigation with the holders of our Series B preferred stock, for example, if they seek to block our refinancing of the Notes. If we are involved in this kind of litigation, we will likely incur significant legal costs in defending any such claim.\nThe failure to repay our Notes and our obligations under our Series B preferred stock adversely affects our financial condition and raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur consolidated debt is substantial and we are highly leveraged, which adversely affects our financial condition and limits our ability to grow and compete. In addition, the existence of the Voting Rights Triggering Event hampers our operations, and may give the Series B preferred stockholders a basis to block our ability to refinance the Notes. These factors, as well as the risks summarized in the two preceding risk factors, are considerations that lead to our conclusion that, as an accounting matter, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nUpon a change of control, we must offer to repurchase all of the Notes and our Series B preferred stock.\nThe terms of our Notes and Series B preferred stock require us, in the event of a change of control, to offer to repurchase all or a portion of a holder\u2019s (i) Notes at an offer price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid dividends to but excluding the purchase date and (ii) shares at an offer price in cash equal to 101% of the liquidation preference of the shares, plus an amount in cash equal to all accumulated and unpaid dividends on those shares up to but excluding the date of repurchase. We do not currently have cash to purchase the Notes or the Series B preferred stock and we will not likely have in the future sufficient funds legally available to make Series B preferred stock purchases. If we are required to purchase Notes in a change of control purchase offer and we do not do so, then we would be in default under the indenture, which could lead, after a 30 day grace period, to an event of default under the Indenture and then the right of Noteholders to exercise various remedies against us, including a foreclosure on our assets that constitutes collateral for the Notes.\nWe have not generated sufficient cash to repay our Notes and our liabilities under our Series B preferred stock, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our Notes and Series B preferred stock, which may not be successful.\nOur cash flows, capital resources and cash raised from asset sales were insufficient to repay our Notes at their maturity and satisfy our obligations under our Series B preferred stock. As a result, we will need to refinance the Notes or seek their repayment from a combination of sources, which will occur after their maturity if we are successful in doing so. One consequence of this is that we have been forced to reduce or delay investments, acquisitions, the growth of our business generally and capital expenditures and will continue to be in that position until we address the Notes\u2019 maturity. We are also seeking to sell non-core assets. We face various risks relating to our attempt to sell these assets, including whether we will be able to effect any such sales on attractive terms or at all, the timing of any such sales, their impact on our cash flow and the risks of receiving FCC approval, which we may not be able to obtain. We may not be able to effect any such measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and, even if successful, those actions may not allow us to repay our Notes or satisfy our obligations with respect to our Series B preferred stock.\nAn additional potential consequence is that, if we refinance the Notes, holders of the Series B preferred stock may at the time claim that such refinancing conflicts with the Certificate of Designations under which the Series B preferred stock was issued, unless each holder of the Series B preferred stock waives or consents to that or we redeem the Series B preferred stock. We cannot assure you that we will be able to find sources of cash to pay the Notes, or that, if we had that cash, that we would be able to do so in light of the rights of the holders of the Series B preferred stock or that we would have enough cash to pay the Notes and also redeem the Series B preferred stock. See \u201c-Failure to repay our Notes.\u201d\nIn addition, we conduct a substantial portion of our operations and own substantive assets through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our Notes and satisfying our obligations under our Series B preferred stock is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our Notes. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and under certain circumstances, legal, tax and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash\nfrom our subsidiaries. While the indenture that governs the Notes limits the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required repayment of the Notes.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows or sell assets to repay our Notes, or to refinance our Notes and satisfy our obligations under the Series B preferred stock on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are highly leveraged and our substantial level of indebtedness adversely affects our financial condition and prevents us from fulfilling our financial obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $279.6 million of total debt outstanding which does not include the $155.8 million outstanding under the Series B preferred stock (comprised of approximately $90.5 million in liquidation preference and $65.3 million in accrued dividends). Such amount outstanding under our Series B preferred stock is accounted for as a liability under GAAP. Our high indebtedness has had and will continue to have significant effect on our business. Our indebtedness, the terms of the Indenture and the existence of a Voting Rights Triggering Event have had and will continue to have several negative effects on us and creates several risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe did not repay the Notes at their maturity, as a result of which there was an event of default under the Indenture;\n\u2022\nrequires us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest at a rate of 12.5% per year and principal on our Notes, which reduces the funds available for the implementation of our strategy, particularly regarding acquisitions and investments and more generally for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimits our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions and investments, working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, which may limit the ability to execute our business strategy;\n\u2022\nprevents us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase Notes tendered to us if there is a change of control or other event requiring such a repurchase, and any failure to repurchase Notes tendered for repurchase would constitute a default under the Indenture;\n\u2022\nheightens our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or in the general economy and restrict us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions;\n\u2022\nplaces us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that may have proportionately less debt and are not facing an impending debt maturity as we are;\n\u2022\nlimits management\u2019s discretion in operating our business; and\n\u2022\nlimits our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate or the general economy; and\nEach of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not currently have sufficient cash on hand and we do not expect to generate sufficient cash from operations or the sale of assets or as a result of the Broadcast Incentive Auction to pay the Notes at maturity. See \u201c-Failure to repay our Notes\u201d.\nThe terms of the Indenture and the Certificate of Designations for the Series B preferred stock restrict our current and future operations.\nThe terms of the Indenture and the Certificate of Designations for the Series B preferred stock contain restrictive covenants that impose significant restrictions on us and may limit, or prevent, our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness, including indebtedness to refinance the Notes;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions, repurchase or redeem our capital stock and make certain restricted investments and make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nalter the businesses we conduct;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends, make loans and sell assets to the Company and other restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into change of control transactions;\n\u2022\nmanage our FCC licenses and broadcast license subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we are:\n\u2022\nlimited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nunable to satisfy our current obligations;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing; or\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities, including acquisition opportunities.\nThese restrictions negatively affect our ability to grow in accordance with our plans, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have experienced net losses in the past and, to the extent that we experience net losses in the future, our ability to raise capital may be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced net losses in the past and in the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a net loss available to common stockholders of $16.3 million. Failure to achieve sustained profitability may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to meet our obligations. Our inability to obtain financing in adequate amounts and on acceptable terms necessary to operate our business, repay our Notes, redeem or refinance our Series B preferred stock or finance future acquisitions negatively impacts our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and raises substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and we compete for advertising revenue with other broadcast stations, as well as other media, many operators of which have greater resources than we do.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and the success of our stations is primarily dependent upon their share of overall advertising revenues within their markets, especially in New York, Los Angeles and Miami. Our broadcast stations compete in their respective markets for audiences and advertising revenues with other broadcast stations of all formats, as well as with other media, such as newspapers, magazines, television, satellite radio, cable services, outdoor advertising, direct mail, Internet radio, smart phones, tablets and other wireless media, the Internet and social media such as Facebook and Twitter. In addition, any changes in the methods used to determine ratings could result in a downward adjustment in our ratings, which could adversely affect our advertising sales in the markets in which we operate.\nAlthough we believe that each of our broadcast stations is able to compete effectively in its respective market, our stations may be unable to maintain or increase their current audience ratings and advertising revenues. Specifically, radio stations can change formats quickly. Any other radio station currently broadcasting could shift its format to duplicate the format of, or develop a format which is more popular than, any of our stations. If a station converts its programming to a format similar to that of one of our stations, or if one of our competitors strengthens its operations, the ratings and station operating income of our station in that market could be adversely affected. Further, we could also lose some of our on-air personalities, which may adversely affect our competitive position in those markets. In addition, other radio companies which are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have may also enter markets in which we operate. A bankruptcy filing could also have an adverse impact on our advertising revenue as advertisers may decide to advertise with our competitors due to any ongoing business uncertainty that may result from such bankruptcy filing. See \u201c-Failure to repay our Notes.\u201d\nAny of these events could cause our stations\u2019 audience ratings, market shares and advertising revenues to decline and any adverse change in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of our business as a whole.\nA large portion of our net revenue and operating income currently comes from our New York, Los Angeles and Miami markets.\nOur New York, Los Angeles and Miami markets accounted for more than 60% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. Therefore, any volatility in our revenues or operating income attributable to stations in these markets could have a significant adverse effect on our consolidated net revenue or operating income. A significant decline in net revenue or operating income from our stations in any of these markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSince our revenues are concentrated in these markets, an economic downturn, increased competition or another significant negative event in any of these markets could reduce our revenues and results of operations more dramatically than other companies that do not depend as much on these markets.\nCancellations, reductions, delays and seasonality in advertising could adversely affect our net revenues.\nWe do not generally obtain long-term commitments from our advertisers. As a result, our advertisers may cancel, reduce or postpone orders. Cancellations, reductions or delays in purchases of advertising time could adversely affect our net revenue, especially if we are unable to replace these purchases. Our expense levels are based, in part, on expected future net revenues and are relatively fixed once set. Therefore, unforeseen decreases in advertising sales could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and operating income.\nIn addition, we experience fluctuations in our broadcasting revenue primarily due to seasonal variations in advertising expenditures by local, regional and national advertisers, causing our net broadcasting revenues to vary throughout the year. Historically, our first calendar quarter (January through March) has generally produced the lowest net broadcasting revenue for the year because of routine post-holiday decreases in advertising expenditures.\nThe effects of such seasonality, combined with any other changes in our broadcasting revenue, make it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the previous results of any specific quarter and may adversely affect operating results.\nWe may be unable to successfully execute our expansion strategy, which may impact our growth.\nWe have pursued, and will continue to pursue subject to having sufficient cash consistent with our recapitalization plan, as a growth strategy the expansion of our media business through selective acquisitions and affiliations, primarily in the largest U.S. Hispanic markets, such as our exchange of radio stations for television stations in Puerto Rico in early 2016. We cannot assure you that our growth strategy will be successful. Our growth strategy is subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe limits on our ability to acquire additional stations due to our current inability to incur additional indebtedness (including to refinance our Notes) resulting from the occurrence of the Voting Rights Triggering Event and our not repaying the Notes at their maturity which resulted in an event of default under the Indenture;\n\u2022\nthe need to raise additional financing, which is currently precluded by the occurrence of the Voting Rights Triggering Event;\n\u2022\nour stock price and market conditions in the financial markets;\n\u2022\nthe need for required regulatory approvals, including FCC and antitrust approvals;\n\u2022\nthe challenges of managing any rapid growth;\n\u2022\nthe difficulties of programming newly acquired stations to attract listenership or viewership; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions affecting the media industry.\nAdditionally, our competitors, who are not subject to such financial restrictions and who have greater resources than we do or existing business in certain markets, have an advantage over us in pursuing and completing strategic acquisitions that we target.\nOur cost-cutting measures may impact our ability to pursue our expansion strategy.\nIn recent years, we have focused on reducing our operating expenses. This has included restructuring our existing businesses, where we have reduced our workforce and eliminated redundant facilities. Although our cost-cutting measures have successfully reduced expenses, our reduced programming expenses and workforce may make it more difficult to take advantage of opportunities for growth in the future.\nThe success of our radio stations depends on the popularity and appeal of our content, which is difficult to predict.\nWe format the programming of each of our radio stations to capture a substantial share of the U.S. Hispanic audience in their respective markets. The U.S. Hispanic population is diverse, consisting of numerous identifiable groups from many different countries of origin and each with its own musical and cultural heritage. Various factors could impact the popularity of our content, including shifts in population, station listenership, demographics, audience tastes and fluctuations in preferred advertising media. The success of our radio stations depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and broadcast content that meets the changing preferences of this broad consumer market. If we are not successful at maintaining and growing the popularity of our content, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nThe success of our television operation depends upon our ability to attract viewers and advertisers to our broadcast television operation.\nAlthough we recorded positive consolidated operating income for our television segment in 2016 under our indenture governing our Notes, our television segment was not profitable per GAAP and may not achieve profitability in the future. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract viewers and advertisers to our broadcast television operation. If we cannot attract viewers, our television operation may suffer from low ratings, which in turn may deter potential advertisers. The inability to successfully attract viewers and advertisers may adversely affect our revenue and operating results for our television operation. Television programming is a highly competitive business. Television stations compete in their respective markets for audiences and advertising revenues with other stations and larger, more established networks. As a result of this competition, our rating share may not grow, and an adverse change in our local markets could have a material adverse impact on the revenue of our television operation.\nThe success of the television operation is largely dependent on certain factors, such as the extent of distribution of the developed programming, the ability to attract viewers and advertisers, the ability to acquire programming, and the market and advertiser acceptance of our programming. We may not be successful in our initiatives, and our initiatives may fail to generate revenues and may ultimately be unprofitable.\nThe loss of distribution agreements could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur MegaTV television operation has entered into station distribution agreements that allow us to serve markets representing over 3.5 million Hispanic households. If our distribution agreements are terminated or not extended, our ability to reach our viewers and receive licensing fees may be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we expect to renew these agreements or make other arrangements to reach viewers, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. We receive advertising inventory from our affiliated stations, either in the form of stand-alone advertising time within a specified time period or commercials inserted by MegaTV into its programming. In addition, primarily with respect to Multichannel Video Programming Distributors, we receive a fee for providing such programming. The loss of distribution agreements of our MegaTV television operation could adversely affect our results of operations by reducing the reach of our network programming and, therefore, its attractiveness to advertisers. Renewal on less favorable terms may also adversely affect our results of operations through the reduction of advertising revenue and fees.\nThe failure or destruction of satellites and transmitter facilities that we depend upon to distribute our programming could materially adversely affect our business and results of operation.\nWe use studios, satellite systems, transmitter facilities and the Internet to originate and/or distribute our station and network programs and commercials to affiliates. We rely on third-party contracts and services to operate our origination and distribution facilities. These third-party contracts and services include, but are not limited to, electrical power, satellite transponders, uplinks and downlinks and telecom circuits. Distribution may be disrupted due to one or more third parties losing their ability to provide particular services to us, which could adversely affect our distribution capabilities. A disruption can be caused as a result of any number of events such as local disasters (accidental or environmental), various acts of terrorism, power outages, major telecom connectivity failures or satellite failures. Our ability to distribute programming to station audiences and/or network affiliates may be disrupted for an undetermined period of time until alternate facilities are engaged and put on-line. Furthermore, until third-party services resume, the inability to originate or distribute programming could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe Must Respond to Rapid Changes in Technology, Content Creation, Services and Standards in Order to Remain Competitive.\nVideo, telecommunications, radio and data services technologies used in the entertainment industry are changing rapidly. Advances in technologies or alternative methods of product delivery or storage, or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies and methods of delivery and storage, could have a negative effect on our businesses. Examples of the foregoing include the convergence of television broadcasts and online delivery of programming to televisions and other devices, video-on-demand platforms, tablets, satellite radio, user-generated content sites, Internet and mobile distribution of video content via\nstreaming and downloading, and place-shifting of content from the home to portable devices on which content is viewable outside the home. For example, devices that allow users to view or listen to television or radio programs on a time-delayed basis; technologies, such as DVRs, that enable users to fast-forward or skip advertisements or increase the sharing of subscription content; systems that allow users to access our copyrighted product over the Internet or other media; and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to view programming or store or make portable copies of programming, may cause changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness our offerings to advertisers and adversely affect our revenues. Also, the growing uses of user-generated content sites and live and stored video streaming sites, which deliver unauthorized copies of copyrighted content, including those emanating from other countries in various languages, may adversely impact our businesses. In addition, further increases in the use of Internet-connected television or other digital devices, which allow users to consume content of their own choosing, in their own time and remote locations while avoiding traditional commercial advertisements or subscription payments, could adversely affect our radio and television broadcasting advertising and subscription revenues. Users who reduce, cancel or never had cable television subscription services are also known as \u201ccord-cutters\u201d or \u201ccord-nevers\u201d. Cable providers and DBS operators are developing new techniques that allow them to transmit more channels on their existing equipment to highly targeted audiences, reducing the cost of creating channels and potentially leading to the division of the television marketplace into more specialized niche audiences. More television and video programming options increase competition for viewers and competitors targeting programming to narrowly defined audiences may gain an advantage over us for television advertising and subscription revenues. Television manufacturers, cable providers and others are developing and offering technology to enable viewers to locate digital copies of programming from the Internet to view on television monitors or other devices, which could diminish viewership of our programming. Generally, changing consumer behavior may impact our traditional distribution methods, for example, by reducing viewership of our programming, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability. Anticipating and adapting to changes in technology on a timely basis and exploiting new sources of revenue from these changes will affect our ability to continue to increase our revenue. Our inability to successfully implement our recapitalization strategy may adversely affect our ability to respond and adapt to changes in technology on a timely basis or at all.\nOur business is dependent upon the performance of key employees, on-air talent and program hosts. Cost increases in the retention of such employees may adversely affect our profits.\nOur business depends upon the efforts, abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key employees, including on-air talent, and our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. We employ or independently contract with several on-air personalities and hosts with significant loyal audiences in their respective markets. Although we have entered into long-term agreements with some of our key on-air talent and program hosts to protect our interests in those relationships, these key on-air personalities and program hosts may not remain with us or may not retain their audiences. Competition for these individuals is intense, and many of our key employees are at-will employees who are under no legal obligation to remain with us. Our competitors may choose to extend offers to any of these individuals on terms which we may be unwilling to meet. In addition, any or all of our key employees may decide to leave for a variety of personal or other reasons beyond our control. Furthermore, the popularity and audience loyalty of our key on-air talent and program hosts is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes. A loss of such popularity or audience loyalty is beyond our control and could limit our ability to generate ratings and revenues.\nThe loss of any of our executive officers and key employees, particularly Ra\u00fal Alarc\u00f3n, Chairman of our Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our personnel.\nWe produce and acquire programming and content and incur costs for all types of creative talent, including on-air talent, programming and production personnel. An increase in the costs of such programming and content or in the costs for creative talent may lead to decreased profitability.\nImpairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives can cause our net income or net loss to fluctuate significantly.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $356.8 million of unamortized intangible assets, including goodwill of $32.8 million and FCC broadcast licenses of $324.0 million on our consolidated balance sheet. These unamortized intangible assets represented approximately 79% of our total assets. Accounting standards require that goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, such as FCC broadcast licenses, are not amortized. Accounting standards require that goodwill and certain intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment. If we find that the carrying value of goodwill or FCC broadcast licenses exceeds their fair value, we will reduce the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset to the fair value and will recognize an impairment loss in our results of operations.\nWe currently account for our FCC broadcast licenses as indefinite-lived assets. In the event we are no longer able to conclude that our FCC broadcast licenses have indefinite lives, we may be required to amortize such licenses. The amortization of our FCC broadcast licenses would affect our earnings and earnings per share.\nThe impairment tests require us to make estimates of the fair value of our intangible assets, which is determined by using a discounted cash flow methodology. Since a number of factors may influence the fair value of our intangible assets, we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles will occur in the future. From time to time in the past, we have incurred significant impairment charges, which have materially adversely affected our results of operations.\nAny future impairments would result in our recognizing a corresponding operating loss, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPiracy of our programming and other content, including digital and internet piracy, may decrease revenue received from the exploitation of our programming and other content and adversely affect our business and profitability.\nPiracy of programming is prevalent in many parts of the world and is made easier by technological advances allowing conversion of programming and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copies of our content. We believe that the proliferation of unauthorized copies and piracy of these products has an adverse effect on our business and profitability because these products reduce the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our media content.\nDamage to our brands or reputation could adversely affect our company.\nOur brands and our reputation are among our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain advertisers for our broadcast stations depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of our company, our ability to produce attractive programming, the strength of our audience and our integrity. Damage to our brands or reputation or negative publicity or perceptions about us, either through infringement of our brands, intellectual property or otherwise, could cause a loss of consumer or advertiser confidence in our company and may adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur business may be adversely affected by legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of our employees.\nIn recent years, a number of employers, including us, have been subject to lawsuits, including alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace, wage-hour and employment discrimination matters, class action lawsuits, and a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. We could also face potential liability if we are found to have misclassified certain employees as exempt from the overtime requirements of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and state labor laws, or for having classified certain personnel as contractors and not as employees under applicable law. We have had and now have some employment-related administrative proceedings and lawsuits pending against us, although none involving class allegations and none that we believe to be material.\nRa\u00fal Alarc\u00f3n, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President, has majority voting control of our common stock and 100% voting control of our Series C preferred stock and this control may discourage or influence certain types of transactions or strategic initiatives.\nRa\u00fal Alarc\u00f3n, Chairman of our Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President, beneficially owns shares of common stock representing approximately 85% of the combined voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2016. Such combined voting power includes Mr. Alarc\u00f3n\u2019s voting control over 380,000 shares of Series C preferred stock (convertible into 760,000 shares of Class A common stock) pursuant to his capacity as trustee for the AAA Trust. As a result, Mr. Alarc\u00f3n generally has the ability to control the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of our entire Board of Directors, mergers and acquisitions and sales of all or substantially all of our assets, and our recapitalization strategy. Mr. Alarc\u00f3n\u2019s voting power may allow him to have a greater influence on our corporate strategy than other equity holders.\nWe cannot assure you that Mr. Alarc\u00f3n will maintain all or any portion of his ownership or that he would continue as an officer or director if he sells a significant part of his stock. Further, the disposition by Mr. Alarc\u00f3n of a sufficient number of shares could result in a change in control of our company, which could trigger a variety of federal, state and local regulatory consent requirements and potentially limit our utilization of net operating losses for income tax purposes, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the secondary market prices of our securities.\nThe liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if we are no longer allowed to trade on the OTCQX\u00ae Best Market.\nWe are currently out of compliance with the OTCQX rules relating to the minimum market capitalization of our publicly held shares for continued trading on the OTCQX. We have until September 30, 2017 to regain compliance. There is no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance by that date.\nOur inability to qualify for trading on the OTCQX would make trading our common stock more difficult for investors, potentially leading to further declines in our share price. Without the ability to trade on the OTCQX, stockholders may have a difficult time getting a quote for the sale or purchase of our stock, the sale or purchase of our stock would likely be made more difficult and the trading volume and liquidity of our stock would likely further decline. In addition to having an adverse effect on the liquidity of our Class A common stock, our inability to meet the Standards for Continued Qualification for the OTCQX would also result in negative publicity and would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital or successfully implement our recapitalization strategy. The absence of such continued qualification may further adversely affect the acceptance of our Class A common stock as currency or the value accorded by other parties. Any further impact on our ability to successfully implement our recapitalization strategy will likely continue to adversely affect our ability to execute our long-term business strategy, including any efforts to use equity capital to finance selective acquisitions, reduce our indebtedness or fund our operations.\nRisks Related to Legislative and Regulatory Matters\nChanges in U.S. communications laws or other regulations may have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe television and radio broadcasting and distribution industries in the United States are highly regulated by U.S. federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC. The television and radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act. For example, we are required to obtain, and periodically renew, licenses from the FCC to operate our radio and television stations. The FCC may not approve our future renewal applications, or it may approve them for less than the full term or subject to conditions or qualifications. FCC license renewal applications for our flagship WSKQ-FM station, which accounts for a material portion of our net revenue, were filed on January 31, 2006 and February 3, 2014. Petitions to deny the applications were filed alleging that WSKQ-FM had broadcast indecent material during the license term. We filed opposition pleadings categorically stating that the allegations made did not raise sufficient questions to warrant nonrenewal of the license. On March 9, 2016, the FCC released a decision denying the allegations and granting the license renewal applications. On April 14, 2016, a Petition for Reconsideration of the grant of the license renewal applications was filed. We filed opposition pleadings and the reconsideration remains pending. Although a station can continue to operate under its expired license pursuant to FCC rules until the FCC takes action on its renewal application and the FCC grants renewal of broadcast licenses in the great majority of cases, we cannot be assured that our licenses will be renewed on favorable terms or at all in future renewal cycles. The non-renewal, or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications, of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe must also comply with extensive FCC regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our television and radio stations and our television network. FCC regulations limit the number of television and radio stations that a licensee can own in a market and the household reach of television stations nationwide. Under the Communications Act, every three years each television broadcast station is required to elect to exercise the right, either to require cable television system and DBS operators in its local market to carry its signal (must carry), or to prohibit carriage or condition it upon payment of a fee or other consideration. These \u201cmust carry\u201d rights are not absolute, and under some circumstances, a cable system or DBS operator may be entitled not to carry a given station. The FCC\u2019s current rules require cable and DBS operators to carry only one channel of the digital signal of our television stations, despite the capability of digital broadcasters to broadcast multiple program streams within one station\u2019s digital allotment. Cable systems and DBS operators may not continue to carry our owned or affiliated television broadcast stations. The failure of a cable system or DBS operator to carry one of our owned or affiliated television stations could have a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nThe U.S. Congress and the FCC currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operation and ownership of our radio and television properties. For example, from time to time, proposals have been advanced in the U.S. Congress and at the FCC to require radio and television broadcast stations to provide advertising time to political candidates for free or at a reduced charge. Any\nrestrictions or reductions in rates on political advertising may adversely affect our advertising revenues. The FCC has initiated a proceeding to examine and potentially regulate more closely embedded advertising, such as product placement and product integration. Enhanced restrictions affecting these means of delivering advertising messages may adversely affect our advertising revenues. The FCC is currently engaged in a review of its media ownership rules. Changes to the media ownership and other FCC rules may affect the competitive landscape in ways that could increase the competition faced by us. We are unable to predict the effect that any such laws, regulations or policies may have on our operations.\nProposed legislation would require radio broadcasters to pay royalties to record labels and recording artists.\nLegislation has been previously introduced in Congress that would require radio broadcasters to pay a royalty to record labels and performing artists for use of their recorded songs. Thus far, the legislation has failed to pass, but it may be reintroduced in the future. Currently, we pay royalties to song composers and publishers through Broadcast Music, Inc., the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers and SESAC, Inc. The proposed legislation would add an additional layer of royalties to be paid directly to the record labels and artists. In addition, radio and recording industry representatives have entered into negotiations in the past that could result in an agreement to resolve the performance fee issue. It is currently unknown what proposed legislation, if any, will become law, whether industry groups will enter into an agreement with respect to fees, and what significance this royalty would have on our results from operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nThe FCC vigorously enforces its indecency and other program content rules against the broadcast industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe FCC\u2019s rules and regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent/profane material because of the vagueness of the FCC\u2019s indecency/profanity definition, coupled with the spontaneity of live programming. The FCC vigorously pursues its enforcement activities as they apply to indecency and has threatened on more than one occasion to initiate license revocation or license renewal proceedings against a broadcast licensee who commits a \u201cserious\u201d indecency violation. The FCC has substantially increased its monetary penalties for violations of these regulations pursuant to law enacted in 2006 that provides the FCC with authority to impose fines of up to $389,305 per incident or profane utterance with a maximum forfeiture exposure of approximately $3.6 million for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. Moreover, the FCC has in some instances imposed separate fines for each allegedly indecent \u201cutterance,\u201d in contrast with its previous policy, which generally considered all indecent words or phrases within a given program as constituting a single violation.\nIn July 2010, the Second Circuit issued a decision in which it vacated the FCC\u2019s indecency policy as unconstitutional. In June 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision which held that the FCC could not fine ABC and Fox for the specific broadcasts at issue in that case because the FCC had not provided them with sufficient notice of its intent to issue fines for the use of fleeting expletives. However, the Court did not make any substantive ruling regarding the FCC\u2019s indecency standards. In April 2013, the FCC requested comments on its indecency policy, including whether it should ban the use of fleeting expletives or whether it should only impose fines for broadcasts that involve repeated and deliberate use of expletives. The FCC has advised that it will continue to pursue enforcement actions in egregious cases while it conducts its review of its indecency policies generally and in 2015 issued a Notice of Apparent Liability for the maximum forfeiture amount of $325,000 against a television station for violation of its indecency policy. We cannot predict whether Congress will consider or adopt further legislation in this area.\nIn addition, the FCC\u2019s heightened focus on the indecency regulatory scheme against the broadcast industry generally may encourage third parties to oppose our license renewal applications or applications for consent to acquire broadcast stations. A number of inquiries or proceedings regarding alleged violations of the FCC\u2019s indecency policy by our stations are currently pending, including a petition to reconsider the renewal of one of our material broadcast licenses. In addition, we have in the past been the subject and may in the future become subject to additional inquiries or proceedings related to our stations\u2019 broadcast of allegedly indecent or obscene material. To the extent that these pending inquiries or other proceedings result in the imposition of fines, revocation of any of our station licenses or denials of license renewal applications, our results of operations and business could be materially adversely affected. We also face increased potential costs in the form of fines for indecency violations, and we cannot predict whether Congress will consider or adopt further legislation in this area.\nOur businesses depend upon licenses issued by the FCC, and if any of those licenses were not renewed or we were to be out of compliance with FCC regulations and policies, our business may be materially impaired.\nOur businesses depend upon maintaining their broadcasting licenses issued by the FCC, which are issued currently for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal thereafter. Interested parties may challenge a renewal application. On rare occasions, the FCC has revoked licenses, not renewed them, or renewed them with significant qualifications, including renewals for less than a full term of eight years. In the past, a few of our stations have operated on expired licenses while their applications for renewal remain pending. We cannot be certain that our future renewal applications will be approved or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications that could adversely affect our operations or result in material impairments, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If any of our FCC licenses are not renewed, we could be prevented from operating the affected station and generating revenue from it.\nFurther, the FCC has a general policy restricting the transferability of a station license while a renewal application for that station is pending, and we must comply with extensive FCC regulations and policies governing the ownership and operation of our stations. FCC regulations limit the number of radio and television stations that a licensee can own in a market, which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions. The FCC\u2019s rules governing our radio station operations impose costs on their operations, and changes in those rules could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The FCC also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations. If the FCC relaxes these technical requirements, it could impair the signals transmitted by our radio stations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, governmental regulations and policies may change over time, and the changes may have a material adverse impact upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is significant uncertainty regarding the FCC\u2019s media ownership rules, and any changes to such rules could restrict our ability to acquire broadcast stations.\nThe Communications Act and FCC rules and policies limit the number of broadcasting properties that any person or entity may own (directly or by attribution) in any market and require FCC approval for transfers of control and assignments of licenses. The FCC\u2019s media ownership rules remain in flux and subject to further agency and court proceedings. The FCC is required to review quadrennially the following media ownership rules and to modify, repeal or retain any rules as it determines to be in the public interest: the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule; the local radio ownership rule; the radio-television cross-ownership rule; the dual network rule; and the local television ownership rule. In addition to the FCC media ownership rules, the outside media interests of our officers and directors could limit our ability to acquire stations. The filing of petitions or complaints against us or any of our license-holding subsidiaries, or any FCC licenses from which we are acquiring a station, could result in the FCC delaying the grant of, or refusing to grant or imposing conditions on, its consent to the assignment or transfer of control of licenses. The Communications Act and FCC rules and policies also impose limitations on non-U.S. ownership and voting of our capital stock. In November 2013, the FCC confirmed that it will consider on a case-by-case basis petitions for approval of foreign ownership that exceeds the 25% threshold and, in September 2016, the FCC adopted specific rules and procedures for the filing and review of such requests. In this decision, the FCC confirmed that it will allow companies to seek approval of up to 100% foreign ownership. In addition, where proposed acquisitions might result in local radio advertising revenue concentration, the Department of Justice and/or the Federal Trade Commission could undertake their own reviews and could attempt to block or place restrictions or conditions on such transactions.\nNew or changing federal, state or international privacy legislation or regulation could hinder the growth of our internet business.\nA variety of federal and state laws govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data that our internet business uses to operate its services and to deliver certain advertisements to its customers, as well as the technologies used to collect such data. Not only are existing privacy-related laws in these jurisdictions evolving and subject to potentially disparate interpretation by governmental entities, new legislative proposals affecting privacy are also now pending at both the federal and state level in the United States. Changes to the interpretation of existing law or the adoption of new privacy-related requirements could hinder the growth of our internet business. Also, a failure or perceived failure to comply with such laws or requirements or with our own policies and procedures could result in significant liabilities, including a possible loss of consumer or investor confidence or a loss of customers or advertisers.", "PERMNO": 87342, "SIC": 4832, "TIC": "SBSAA"}
