You should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the other information in this filing before deciding to invest in our company. Any of the risk factors described below could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently considered to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, the trading price or value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business\nWe have a limited operating history and expect to continue to incur losses for an indeterminable period of time.\nWe have a limited operating history and are engaged in the initial stages of exploration, development and exploitation of our leasehold acreage and will continue to be so until commencement of substantial production from our oil and natural gas properties, which will depend upon successful drilling results, additional and timely capital funding, and access to suitable infrastructure. Companies in their initial stages of development face substantial business risks and may suffer significant losses. We have generated substantial net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities in the past and expect to continue to incur substantial net losses as we continue our drilling program. In considering an investment in our common stock, you should consider that there is only limited historical and financial operating information available upon which to base your evaluation of our performance. We have incurred net losses of $60,796,000 from the date of inception (February 9, 2011) through December 31, 2014. Additionally, we are dependent on obtaining additional debt and/or equity financing to roll-out and scale our planned principal business operations. Management\u2019s plans in regard to these matters consist principally of seeking additional debt and/or equity financing combined with expected cash flows from current oil and gas assets held and additional oil and gas assets that we may acquire. Our efforts may not be successful and funds may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe face challenges and uncertainties in financial planning as a result of the unavailability of historical data and uncertainties regarding the nature, scope and results of our future activities. New companies must develop successful business relationships, establish operating procedures, hire staff, install management information and other systems, establish facilities and obtain licenses, as well as take other measures necessary to conduct their intended business activities. We may not be successful in implementing our business strategies or in completing the development of the infrastructure necessary to conduct our business as planned. In the event that one or more of our drilling programs is not completed or is delayed or terminated, our operating results will be adversely affected and our operations will differ materially from the activities described in this Annual Report. As a result of industry factors or factors relating specifically to us, we may have to change our methods of conducting business, which may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The uncertainty and risks described in this Annual Report may impede our ability to economically find, develop, exploit and acquire oil and natural gas reserves. As a result, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows provided by our operating activities in the future.\nWe will need additional capital to complete future acquisitions, conduct our operations and fund our business and our ability to obtain the necessary funding is uncertain.\nWe will need to raise additional funding to complete future potential acquisitions and may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our operations, acquire assets and complete exploration and drilling operations. In such a case, adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms. If we need to raise additional funds in the future, by issuing equity securities, dilution to existing stockholders will result, and such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future and we are unable to generate sufficient revenue from new business arrangements, to complete planned acquisitions or operations, our results of operations and the value of our securities could be adversely affected.\nOur $34.5 million Continental Acquisition debt facility and $15.5 million drilling facility, includes various covenants, reduces our financial flexibility, increases our interest expense and may adversely impact our operations and our costs.\nIn connection with our acquisition of the Wattenberg Asset on March 7, 2014, we entered into a senior debt facility pursuant to which we borrowed $34.5 million initially and have subsequently borrowed an additional $2.0 million, leaving $13.5 million available for future drilling operations, subject to the terms and conditions of such facility (as described in greater detail below in the risk factor entitled \u201cOur ability to borrow additional funds under the debt facility is subject to certain requirements and limitations set forth in our debt facility\u201d), which amounts represent a significant amount of additional indebtedness. The debt facility includes various covenants (positive and negative) binding us, including:\n\u25cf\nrequiring that we maintain the registration of our common stock under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended;\n\u25cf\nrequiring that we maintain the listing of our common stock on the NYSE MKT;\n\u25cf\nrequiring that we timely file periodic reports under the Exchange Act;\n\u25cf\nrequiring that we provide the lenders yearly and quarterly budgets and certain reserve reports;\n\u25cf\nrequiring that we provide capital expenditure plans to the lenders prior to making certain expenditures;\n\u25cf\nprohibiting us and our subsidiaries from creating or becoming subject to any indebtedness, except pursuant to certain limited exceptions; and\n\u25cf\nprohibiting us or our subsidiaries from merging, selling their assets (except in the usual course of business), altering our organizational structure, winding up or liquidating, except in certain limited circumstances.\nThis new debt facility affects our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u25cf\na significant portion of our cash flows must be used to service the debt facility, including the obligation to pay monthly in arrears interest accruing at 15% per annum, and the monthly obligation to prepay the debt in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) the outstanding principal amount of the debt and (b) twenty-five percent (25%) of the aggregate of all net revenues actually received by us and our subsidiaries;\n\u25cf\nthe high level of debt could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments; and\n\u25cf\nthe debt covenants may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry.\nThe high level of indebtedness under this new debt facility increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the principal or interest on our debt, 25% of any revenues we do generate will be required to be used to repay the debt, and future working capital, borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. If we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to arrange financing to pay the interest or principal due on the debt, fund our business plan and satisfy our other obligations and liabilities, we may have to sell significant assets or have a portion of our assets foreclosed upon which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not currently have any commitments of additional capital except pursuant to the terms of the debt facility. We can provide no assurance that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. If we choose to raise additional capital through the sale of other debt or equity securities, such sales may cause substantial dilution to our existing shareholders.\nThe repayment of our senior debt facility is secured by a security interest in all of our assets.\nThe repayment of our senior debt facility (which currently has an outstanding principal balance of $35.6 million and provides us the option, pursuant to the terms of the debt facility, to borrow an additional $13.5 million) is secured by a first priority security interest in all of our assets, property, real property and the securities of our subsidiaries and the repayment of such debt is further guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. If we default in the repayment of the senior debt facility and/or any of the terms and conditions thereof, the lenders may enforce their security interest over our assets which secure the repayment of such debt, and we could be forced to curtail or abandon our current business plans and operations. If that were to happen, any investment in the Company could become worthless.\nOur ability to borrow additional funds under the senior debt facility is subject to certain requirements and limitations set forth in our senior debt facility.\nFrom time to time, subject to the terms and conditions of the senior debt facility (including the requirement that we deposited funds in an aggregate amount of any additional requested loan into a segregated bank account (the \u201cCompany Deposits\u201d)), we currently have the right to request additional loans under our senior debt facility up to an additional $13.5 million in total or an aggregate of $50 million under such debt facility. We are required to pay original issue discounts in the amount of 5% of the funds borrowed, underwriting fees in the amount of 10% of the amount of the funds borrowed, reimburse certain of the legal fees of the lender\u2019s counsel, and pay applicable investment banking fees representing 5% of any funds borrowed, in connection with funds borrowed. Funds borrowed are only eligible to be used by us, together with Company Deposits, for approved authorization for expenditures (\u201cAFEs\u201d) issued for a well or wells to be drilled and completed on any properties acquired in connection with the Wattenberg Asset, or the Mississippian Asset (the \u201cPermitted Expenditures\u201d). In the event we drill a dry hole, we are prohibited from using any additional proceeds borrowed under the senior debt facility without the consent of the lender. The requirement that we put up funds equal to any further borrowing under the facility, fees required to be paid in connection with such further loans and the restrictions on our ability to borrow funds under such debt facility and our use of such funds may limit our ability to borrow funds under such facility, complete our planned business operations with funds from such senior debt facility, and increase our cost of borrowing, which individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe occurrence of an event of default under the notes sold in connection with our senior debt facility could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition.\nThe notes issued in connection with our senior debt facility include standard and customary events of default, including, among other things, our or any subsidiary\u2019s default in the payment of any indebtedness under any agreement, or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of any other agreement related to indebtedness or otherwise, if the effect of such failure or default, is to cause, or permit the holder or holders thereof, or any counterparty to an agreement relating to indebtedness, to cause indebtedness, or amounts due thereunder, in an aggregate amount of $250,000 or more to become due prior to its stated date of maturity or the date such amount would otherwise have been due notwithstanding such default, subject to certain exclusions; the loss, suspension or revocation of, or failure to renew, any license or permit, if such license or permit is not obtained or reinstated within thirty (30) days, unless such loss, suspension, revocation or failure to renew could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on us; or there is filed against us or any of our subsidiaries or any of our officers, members or managers any civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding under any federal or state racketeering statute (including, without limitation, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act of 1970), or any civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding under any other applicable law is filed by any governmental entity, that could result in the confiscation or forfeiture of any material portion of any collateral subject to any security interest held by the investors or their agent or other assets of such entity or person, and such action, suit or proceeding is not dismissed within one hundred twenty (120) days.\nUpon an event of default under the notes, the holder of such note may declare the entire unpaid balance (as well as any interest, fees and expenses) immediately due and payable. Funding to repay such notes may not be available timely, on favorable terms, if at all, and any default by us of the terms and conditions of the notes would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nWe owe certain obligations to MIEJ under the New MIEJ Note, which is secured by a subordinated security interest in substantially all of our assets and is convertible into shares of our common stock in the event we are unable to repay such note at maturity.\nThe New MIEJ Note is subordinated in every way to the senior credit facility as well as to New Senior Lending (defined below); however, MIEJ has no control over our cash flow, nor is MIEJ\u2019s consent required in connection with any disposition, sale, or use of any of our assets, provided that the requirements of the New MIEJ Note requiring the prepayment of interest, where applicable, as described below are followed. We have the right under the New MIEJ Note to enter into a loan, or a series of new loans or any other new non-equity investment or assumption of indebtedness (a \u201cNew Senior Lending\u201d) which will be senior to the New MIEJ Note, without the prior consent of MIEJ, provided that, in addition to the approximately $35.5 million principal balance of the PEDEVCO Senior Loan, the New Senior Lending is subject to a cap of an additional $60 million in the aggregate, such that the total lending, debt or similar investment under such cap shall not exceed $95 million in the aggregate (the \u201cSenior Debt Cap\u201d), with any portion of New Senior Lending in excess of the Senior Debt Cap advanced first to MIEJ until the New MIEJ Note is paid in full. The New MIEJ Note shall automatically, and without further consent from MIEJ, be subordinated in every way to any such New Senior Lending. Should we enter into any new financing transaction that results in raising New Senior Lending of at least $20 million in excess of the balance of the PEDEVCO Senior Loan, then MIEJ has a right to be paid all interest and fees that have accrued on the New MIEJ Note each and every time that a new financing transaction reaches or exceeds the $20 million threshold.\nThe New MIEJ Note is due and payable on March 8, 2017, subject to automatic extensions upon the occurrence of a Long-Term Financing or PEDEVCO Senior Lending Restructuring (each as defined below) (the \u201cMaturity\u201d). On a one-time basis, the PEDEVCO Senior Loan may be refinanced by a new loan (\u201cLong-Term Financing\u201d) by one or more third party replacement lenders (\u201cReplacement Lenders\u201d), and in such event we are required to undertake commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the Replacement Lenders to simultaneously refinance both the PEDEVCO Senior Loan and the New MIEJ Note as part of such Long-Term Financing. Despite such efforts, should the Replacement Lenders be unable or unwilling to include the New MIEJ Note in such financing, then the Long-Term Financing may proceed without including the New MIEJ Note, and the New MIEJ Note shall remain in place and shall be automatically subordinated, without further consent of MIEJ, to such Long-Term Financing. Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Long-Term Financing, the Maturity of the New MIEJ Note is automatically extended, without further consent of MIEJ, to the same maturity date of the Long-Term Financing (the \u201cExtended Maturity Date\u201d), provided that the Extended Maturity Date may not exceed March 8, 2020. Additionally, upon the closing of such Long-Term Financing: (a) the Long-Term Financing is required to be subject to the Senior Debt Cap, (b) we are required to make commercially reasonable best efforts for the Long-Term Financing to include adequate reserves or other payment provisions whereby MIEJ is paid all interest and fees accrued on the New MIEJ Note commencing as of March 8, 2017 (and annually thereafter, until such time as the New MIEJ Note is paid in full), but in any event the Replacement Lenders are required to agree to allow for quarterly interest payments (starting March 31, 2017) of not less than 5% per annum on the outstanding balance of the New MIEJ Note, plus a one-time payment of accrued interest (not to exceed $500,000) as of March 31, 2017 (the \u201cSubordinated Interest Payments\u201d), and the remaining 5% interest shall continue to accrue, and (c) MIEJ has the Right of Conversion (defined below) commencing as of March 8, 2017, the original maturity date of the New MIEJ Note. If the PEDEVCO Senior Loan and/or New Senior Lending is not refinanced by Replacement Lenders, but is instead refinanced, restructured or extended by the existing PEDEVCO Senior Loan Investors (a \u201cPEDEVCO Senior Lending Restructuring\u201d), the maturity of both the New MIEJ Note and the PEDEVCO Senior Loan may be extended to no later than March 8, 2019, without requiring the consent of MIEJ, provided that (i) any such extension of the maturity date of the New MIEJ Note past March 8, 2017 shall give MIEJ the Right of Conversion (described below) commencing on March 8, 2017, and (ii) such extension agreement shall include payment provisions whereby MIEJ shall be paid all interest and fees accrued on the New MIEJ Note as of March 8, 2018. The New MIEJ Note may be prepaid any time without penalty, and should we repay the New MIEJ Note on or before December 31, 2015, 20% of the principal of the New MIEJ Note amount is required to be forgiven by MIEJ, and should we repay the New MIEJ Note on or before December 31, 2016, 15% of the principal of the New MIEJ Note amount is required to be forgiven by MIEJ.\nThe New MIEJ Note has a conversion feature that provides, in the event that the final maturity of the New MIEJ Note is extended beyond March 8, 2017 for whatever reason, MIEJ has the right, at its discretion, to have the outstanding balance of the New MIEJ Note plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon converted in whole or in part into our common stock at a price (the \u201cConversion Price\u201d) equal to 80% of the average closing price per share of our common stock over the then previous 60 days from the date MIEJ exercises its conversion right (subject to adjustment for stock splits, recapitalizations and the like)(such event, a \u201cRight of Conversion\u201d); provided, however, that in no event shall the Conversion Price be less than $0.30 per share (the \u201cFloor Price\u201d). Additionally, the New MIEJ Note contains a provision preventing the conversion of the MIEJ Note to the extent that such conversion would result in more than 19.9% of our outstanding common stock or voting stock being issued in aggregate upon the conversion of such note, or otherwise require shareholder approval under the NYSE MKT rules. Notwithstanding that, we agreed to include a proposal in our proxy statement for our 2016 annual meeting of our shareholders (the \u201c2016 Annual Meeting\u201d) for the approval of the issuance of the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable in connection with conversion of the New MIEJ Note, assuming conversion at the Floor Price (the \u201cMaximum Conversion Shares\u201d). In the event the vote fails at the 2016 Annual Meeting, we are required to take all commercially reasonable action to procure such approval no later than the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders.\nIf an event of default occurs under the New MIEJ Note, MIEJ may enforce their security interests over our assets (subject to the subordination rights in such note) which secure the repayment of such obligations, and we could be forced to curtail or abandon our current business plans and operations. If that were to happen, any investment in us could become worthless.\nThe required interest and principal payments due under the New MIEJ Note may make it harder for us to refinance the New MIEJ Note or raise funding in the future, or could materially decrease the amount of cash we receive for our operations upon any refinancing or fundings.\nIf we are unable to repay the New MIEJ Note prior to maturity, the issuance of common stock pursuant to the terms of the New MIEJ Note could result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are highly speculative and involve a high degree of risk, with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. We have not recorded significant proved reserves, and areas that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercial quantities or at all.\nExploring for and developing hydrocarbon reserves involves a high degree of operational and financial risk, which precludes us from definitively predicting the costs involved and time required to reach certain objectives. Our potential drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial additional interpretation before they can be drilled. The budgeted costs of planning, drilling, completing and operating wells are often exceeded and such costs can increase significantly due to various complications that may arise during the drilling and operating processes. Before a well is spud, we may incur significant geological and geophysical (seismic) costs, which are incurred whether a well eventually produces commercial quantities of hydrocarbons or is drilled at all. Exploration wells bear a much greater risk of loss than development wells. The analogies we draw from available data from other wells, more fully explored locations or producing fields may not be applicable to our drilling locations. If our actual drilling and development costs are significantly more than our estimated costs, we may not be able to continue our operations as proposed and could be forced to modify our drilling plans accordingly.\nIf we decide to drill a certain location, there is a risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be found or produced. We may drill or participate in new wells that are not productive. We may drill wells that are productive, but that do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover exploration, drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. Even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon-bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, resulting in a reduction in production and reserves from the well or abandonment of the well. Whether a well is ultimately productive and profitable depends on a number of additional factors, including the following:\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and industry conditions, including the prices received for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nshortages of, or delays in, obtaining equipment, including hydraulic fracturing equipment, and qualified personnel;\n\u25cf\npotential drainage by operators on adjacent properties;\n\u25cf\nloss of or damage to oilfield development and service tools;\n\u25cf\nproblems with title to the underlying properties;\n\u25cf\nincreases in severance taxes;\n\u25cf\nadverse weather conditions that delay drilling activities or cause producing wells to be shut down;\n\u25cf\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations; and\n\u25cf\nproximity to and capacity of transportation facilities.\nIf we do not drill productive and profitable wells in the future, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur success is dependent on the prices of oil and natural gas. Low oil or natural gas prices and the substantial volatility in these prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements and financial obligations.\nThe prices we receive for our oil and natural gas heavily influence our revenue, profitability, cash flow available for capital expenditures, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the prices for oil and natural gas have been volatile. For example, for the four years ended December 31, 2014, the NYMEX - WTI oil price ranged from a high of $115 per Bbl to a low of $52 per Bbl, while the NYMEX - Henry Hub natural gas price ranged from a high of $8.15 per MMBtu to a low of $1.82 per MMBtu. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors. These factors include the following:\n\u25cf\nthe domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe domestic and foreign demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe prices and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u25cf\nthe price and quantity of foreign imports of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of U.S. dollar exchange rates on oil and natural gas prices;\n\u25cf\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u25cf\nspeculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;\n\u25cf\nlocalized supply and demand fundamentals, including the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering and transportation systems for natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of refining capacity;\n\u25cf\nthe prices and availability of alternative fuel sources;\n\u25cf\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u25cf\npolitical conditions in or affecting oil and natural gas producing regions, including the Middle East and South America;\n\u25cf\nthe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military action and civil unrest;\n\u25cf\npublic pressure on, and legislative and regulatory interest within, federal, state and local governments to stop, significantly limit or regulate hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u25cf\nthe level of global oil and natural gas inventories and exploration and production activity;\n\u25cf\nauthorization of exports from the Unites States of liquefied natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of energy conservation efforts;\n\u25cf\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption; and\n\u25cf\noverall worldwide economic conditions.\nDeclines in oil or natural gas prices would not only reduce our revenue, but could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. Should natural gas or oil prices decrease from current levels and remain there for an extended period of time, we may elect in the future to delay some of our exploration and development plans for our prospects, or to cease exploration or development activities on certain prospects due to the anticipated unfavorable economics from such activities, and, as a result, we may have to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, each of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDeclining general economic, business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nConcerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit, the United States mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the United States have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. These factors, combined with volatile prices of oil and natural gas, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have precipitated an economic slowdown and a recession. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad continues to deteriorate, demand for petroleum products could diminish, which could impact the price at which we can sell our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers and customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur exploration, development and exploitation projects require substantial capital expenditures that may exceed cash on hand, cash flows from operations and potential borrowings, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital on satisfactory terms, which could adversely affect our future growth.\nOur exploration and development activities are capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the development, exploitation, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. Our cash on hand, our operating cash flows and future potential borrowings may not be adequate to fund our future acquisitions or future capital expenditure requirements. The rate of our future growth may be dependent, at least in part, on our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be acceptable.\nOur cash flows from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u25cf\nour estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u25cf\nthe amount of oil and natural gas we produce from existing wells;\n\u25cf\nthe prices at which we sell our production;\n\u25cf\nthe costs of developing and producing our oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u25cf\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u25cf\nthe ability and willingness of banks to lend to us; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to access the equity and debt capital markets.\nIn addition, future events, such as terrorist attacks, wars or combat peace-keeping missions, financial market disruptions, general economic recessions, oil and natural gas industry recessions, large company bankruptcies, accounting scandals, overstated reserves estimates by major public oil companies and disruptions in the financial and capital markets have caused financial institutions, credit rating agencies and the public to more closely review the financial statements, capital structures and earnings of public companies, including energy companies. Such events have constrained the capital available to the energy industry in the past, and such events or similar events could adversely affect our access to funding for our operations in the future.\nIf our revenues decrease as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels, further develop and exploit our current properties or invest in additional exploration opportunities. Alternatively, a significant improvement in oil and natural gas prices or other factors could result in an increase in our capital expenditures and we may be required to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities, the sale of production payments, the sale or farm out of interests in our assets, the borrowing of funds or otherwise to meet any increase in capital needs. If we are unable to raise additional capital from available sources at acceptable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, future debt financings may require that a portion of our cash flows provided by operating activities be used for the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. Debt financing may involve covenants that restrict our business activities. If we succeed in selling additional equity securities to raise funds, at such time the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be diluted, and new investors may demand rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If we choose to farm-out interests in our prospects, we may lose operating control over such prospects.\nOur oil and natural gas reserves are estimated and may not reflect the actual volumes of oil and natural gas we will receive, and significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating accumulations of oil and natural gas is complex and is not exact, due to numerous inherent uncertainties. The process relies on interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions related to, among other things, oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The accuracy of a reserves estimate is a function of:\n\u25cf\nthe quality and quantity of available data;\n\u25cf\nthe interpretation of that data;\n\u25cf\nthe judgment of the persons preparing the estimate; and\n\u25cf\nthe accuracy of the assumptions.\nThe accuracy of any estimates of proved reserves generally increases with the length of the production history. Due to the limited production history of our properties, the estimates of future production associated with these properties may be subject to greater variance to actual production than would be the case with properties having a longer production history. As our wells produce over time and more data is available, the estimated proved reserves will be re-determined on at least an annual basis and may be adjusted to reflect new information based upon our actual production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas most likely will vary from our estimates. It is possible that future production declines in our wells may be greater than we have estimated. Any significant variance to our estimates could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nWe may record impairments of oil and gas properties that would reduce our shareholders\u2019 equity.\nThe successful efforts method of accounting is used for oil and gas exploration and production activities. Under this method, all costs for development wells, support equipment and facilities, and proved mineral interests in oil and gas properties are capitalized. We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost-carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by estimating the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset\u2019s carrying value and estimated fair value. This impairment does not impact cash flows from operating activities but does reduce earnings and our shareholders\u2019 equity. The risk that we will be required to recognize impairments of our oil and gas properties increases during periods of low oil or gas prices. As a result, there is an increased risk that we will incur an impairment in 2015. In addition, impairments would occur if we were to experience sufficient downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or the present value of estimated future net revenues. An impairment recognized in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even if higher oil and gas prices increase the cost center ceiling applicable to the subsequent period. We have in the past and could in the future incur additional impairments of oil and gas properties.\nWe may have accidents, equipment failures or mechanical problems while drilling or completing wells or in production activities, which could adversely affect our business.\nWhile we are drilling and completing wells or involved in production activities, we may have accidents or experience equipment failures or mechanical problems in a well that cause us to be unable to drill and complete the well or to continue to produce the well according to our plans. We may also damage a potentially hydrocarbon-bearing formation during drilling and completion operations. Such incidents may result in a reduction of our production and reserves from the well or in abandonment of the well.\nOur operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be adequately insured.\nThere are numerous operational hazards inherent in oil and natural gas exploration, development, production and gathering, including:\n\u25cf\nunusual or unexpected geologic formations;\n\u25cf\nnatural disasters;\n\u25cf\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated pressures;\n\u25cf\nloss of drilling fluid circulation;\n\u25cf\nblowouts where oil or natural gas flows uncontrolled at a wellhead;\n\u25cf\ncratering or collapse of the formation;\n\u25cf\npipe or cement leaks, failures or casing collapses;\n\u25cf\nfires or explosions;\n\u25cf\nreleases of hazardous substances or other waste materials that cause environmental damage;\n\u25cf\npressures or irregularities in formations; and\n\u25cf\nequipment failures or accidents.\nIn addition, there is an inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations, some of which may be material, due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, our emissions to air and water, the underground injection or other disposal of our wastes, the use of hydraulic fracturing fluids and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices.\nAny of these or other similar occurrences could result in the disruption or impairment of our operations, substantial repair costs, personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution and substantial revenue losses. The location of our wells, gathering systems, pipelines and other facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could significantly increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. Insurance against all operational risks is not available to us. We are not fully insured against all risks, including development and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. We maintain $2 million general liability coverage and $10 million umbrella coverage that covers our and our subsidiaries\u2019 business and operations. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Red Hawk, which operates our D-J Basin Asset, also maintains a $10 million control of well insurance policy that covers its operations in Colorado. With respect to our other non-operated assets, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the perceived risks presented. Losses could, therefore, occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. Moreover, insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms. Changes in the insurance markets due to various factors may make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of coverage in the future. As a result, we may not be able to obtain the levels or types of insurance we would otherwise have obtained prior to these market changes, and the insurance coverage we do obtain may not cover certain hazards or all potential losses that are currently covered, and may be subject to large deductibles. Losses and liabilities from uninsured and underinsured events and delay in the payment of insurance proceeds could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe threat and impact of terrorist attacks, cyber attacks or similar hostilities may adversely impact our operations.\nWe cannot assess the extent of either the threat or the potential impact of future terrorist attacks on the energy industry in general, and on us in particular, either in the short-term or in the long-term. Uncertainty surrounding such hostilities may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines and gathering systems, production facilities, processing plants and refineries, could be targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror, a cyber attack or electronic security breach, or an act of war.\nFailure to adequately protect critical data and technology systems could materially affect our operations.\nInformation technology solution failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding processing of transactions and reporting financial results, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer, employee or our information, or damage to our reputation. There can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur strategy as an onshore unconventional resource player may result in operations concentrated in certain geographic areas and may increase our exposure to many of the risks described in this Annual Report.\nOur current operations are concentrated in the state of Colorado. This concentration may increase the potential impact of many of the risks described in this Annual Report. For example, we may have greater exposure to regulatory actions impacting Colorado, natural disasters in Colorado, competition for equipment, services and materials available in Colorado and access to infrastructure and markets in Colorado.\nUnless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe rate of production from our oil and natural gas properties will decline as our reserves are depleted. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our income and cash flow, are highly dependent on our success in (a) efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves on properties owned by us or by other persons or entities and (b) economically finding or acquiring additional oil and natural gas producing properties. In the future, we may have difficulty acquiring new properties. During periods of low oil and/or natural gas prices, it will become more difficult to raise the capital necessary to finance expansion activities. If we are unable to replace our production, our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur strategy includes acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties, and our failure to identify or complete future acquisitions successfully, including our planned combination with Dome Energy, or not produce projected revenues associated with the future acquisitions could reduce our earnings and hamper our growth.\nWe may be unable to identify properties for acquisition or to make acquisitions on terms that we consider economically acceptable. There is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry. Competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. The completion and pursuit of acquisitions may be dependent upon, among other things, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and, in some cases, regulatory approvals. Our ability to grow through acquisitions will require us to continue to invest in operations, financial and management information systems and to attract, retain, motivate and effectively manage our employees. The inability to manage the integration of acquisitions effectively could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations, and could negatively impact our results of operations and growth potential. Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of the completion of significant acquisitions during particular periods. If we are not successful in identifying or acquiring any material property interests, our earnings could be reduced and our growth could be restricted.\nWe may engage in bidding and negotiating to complete successful acquisitions. We may be required to alter or increase substantially our capitalization to finance these acquisitions through the use of cash on hand, the issuance of debt or equity securities, the sale of production payments, the sale of non-strategic assets, the borrowing of funds or otherwise. If we were to proceed with one or more acquisitions involving the issuance of our common stock, our shareholders would suffer dilution of their interests. Furthermore, our decision to acquire properties that are substantially different in operating or geologic characteristics or geographic locations from areas with which our staff is familiar may impact our productivity in such areas.\nWe may not be able to produce the projected revenues related to future acquisitions. There are many assumptions related to the projection of the revenues of future acquisitions including, but not limited to, drilling success, oil and natural gas prices, production decline curves and other data. If revenues from future acquisitions do not meet projections, this could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThere is no guarantee that the proposed combination transaction with Dome Energy will be completed, and the failure to consummate such proposed transaction could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn February 2015, the Company, Dome AB, and Dome US, entered into a Heads of Agreement which contemplates the acquisition by the Company of 100% of the capital stock of Dome US in exchange for approximately 140 million shares of our common stock. Dome US produces approximately 1,250 BOEPD from a core operated portfolio of conventional oil and gas assets located in Texas and Wyoming, and from additional non-core producing assets located in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma. See further details regarding this transaction above under \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d - \u201cRecent Developments - Heads of Agreement with Dome Energy\u201d. The obligations of the parties under the Heads of Agreement are conditioned upon satisfaction or waiver by the parties of the following conditions: (i) approval by each party\u2019s Board of Directors and shareholders in accordance with applicable law and their respective governing documents; (ii) approval of a mutually agreeable definitive acquisition agreement; (iii) approval from the NYSE MKT of the DOME Acquisition and the issuance and additional listing of the Consideration Shares; (iv) the registration with the SEC of the Consideration Shares; (v) the provision for the repayment or satisfaction of all amounts due and outstanding under the PEDEVCO Senior Loan on or immediately following the closing of the DOME Acquisition; (vi) agreement by RJC to subordinate the Amended GGE Note to DOME US\u2019s senior credit facility; (vii) consummation by the Company of the acquisition of the Acquired Assets from GGE (as described above); (viii) receipt of all material necessary third party consents and approvals, including approval from each party\u2019s senior lenders, as necessary and required; (ix) the Company\u2019s continued listing on the NYSE MKT; and (x) completion by each party of confirmatory due diligence, to each party\u2019s satisfaction, including, but not limited to, with respect to the other party\u2019s oil and gas production, leaseholds, and financial condition.\nThe parties intend to negotiate and enter into definitive documentation as soon as practicable, with an anticipated signing date to occur before April 30, 2015, and upon terms and conditions as mutually acceptable to the parties. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, if the DOME Acquisition has not closed by September 30, 2015, either party may terminate the proposed transaction. The Dome Energy combination represents a significant business opportunity for us. We estimate that our acreage and net production would increase significantly in the event such transaction closes and, if we fail to consummate this transaction or the acquisition is not successful, our anticipated business and results of operations could be adversely affected, we may be delisted from the NYSE MKT and the value of our common stock may decline in value.\nWe may purchase oil and natural gas properties with liabilities or risks that we did not know about or that we did not assess correctly, and, as a result, we could be subject to liabilities that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nBefore acquiring oil and natural gas properties, we estimate the reserves, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential environmental liabilities and other factors relating to the properties. However, our review involves many assumptions and estimates, and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. As a result, we may not discover all existing or potential problems associated with the properties we buy. We may not become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not generally perform inspections on every well or property, and we may not be able to observe mechanical and environmental problems even when we conduct an inspection. The seller may not be willing or financially able to give us contractual protection against any identified problems, and we may decide to assume environmental and other liabilities in connection with properties we acquire. If we acquire properties with risks or liabilities we did not know about or that we did not assess correctly, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as we settle claims and incur cleanup costs related to these liabilities.\nWe may incur losses or costs as a result of title deficiencies in the properties in which we invest.\nIf an examination of the title history of a property that we have purchased reveals an oil and natural gas lease has been purchased in error from a person who is not the owner of the property, our interest would be worthless. In such an instance, the amount paid for such oil and natural gas lease as well as any royalties paid pursuant to the terms of the lease prior to the discovery of the title defect would be lost.\nPrior to the drilling of an oil and natural gas well, it is the normal practice in the oil and natural gas industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review of the spacing unit within which the proposed oil and natural gas well is to be drilled to ensure there are no obvious deficiencies in title to the well. Frequently, as a result of such examinations, certain curative work must be done to correct deficiencies in the marketability of the title, and such curative work entails expense. Our failure to cure any title defects may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves. In the future, we may suffer a monetary loss from title defects or title failure. Additionally, unproved and unevaluated acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. If there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest, we will suffer a financial loss which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nOur management team has identified and scheduled drilling locations in our operating areas over a multi-year period. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of factors, including the availability of equipment and capital, approval by regulators, seasonal conditions, oil and natural gas prices, assessment of risks, costs and drilling results. The final determination on whether to drill any of these locations will be dependent upon the factors described elsewhere in this filing and the documents incorporated by reference herein, as well as, to some degree, the results of our drilling activities with respect to our established drilling locations. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the drilling locations we have identified will be drilled within our expected timeframe or at all or if we will be able to economically produce hydrocarbons from these or any other potential drilling locations. Our actual drilling activities may be materially different from our current expectations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently license only a limited amount of seismic and other geological data and may have difficulty obtaining additional data at a reasonable cost, which could adversely affect our future results of operations.\nWe currently license only a limited amount of seismic and other geological data to assist us in exploration and development activities. We intend to obtain access to additional data in our areas of interest through licensing arrangements with companies that own or have access to that data or by paying to obtain that data directly. Seismic and geological data can be expensive to license or obtain. We may not be able to license or obtain such data at an acceptable cost. In addition, even when properly interpreted, seismic data and visualization techniques are not conclusive in determining if hydrocarbons are present in economically producible amounts and seismic indications of hydrocarbon saturation are generally not reliable indicators of productive reservoir rock.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, completion equipment and services, supplies and personnel, including hydraulic fracturing equipment and personnel, could adversely affect our ability to establish and execute exploration and development plans within budget and on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nShortages or the high cost of drilling rigs, completion equipment and services, supplies or personnel could delay or adversely affect our operations. When drilling activity in the United States increases, associated costs typically also increase, including those costs related to drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and personnel and the services and products of other vendors to the industry. These costs may increase, and necessary equipment and services may become unavailable to us at economical prices. Should this increase in costs occur, we may delay drilling activities, which may limit our ability to establish and replace reserves, or we may incur these higher costs, which may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the demand for hydraulic fracturing services currently exceeds the availability of fracturing equipment and crews across the industry and in our operating areas in particular. The accelerated wear and tear of hydraulic fracturing equipment due to its deployment in unconventional oil and natural gas fields characterized by longer lateral lengths and larger numbers of fracturing stages has further amplified this equipment and crew shortage. If demand for fracturing services continues to increase or the supply of fracturing equipment and crews decreases, then higher costs could result and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have limited control over activities on properties we do not operate.\nWe are not the operator on some of our properties and, as a result, our ability to exercise influence over the operations of these properties or their associated costs is limited. Our dependence on the operators and other working interest owners of these projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs or control the risks could materially and adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities. The success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depends upon a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\ntiming and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u25cf\nthe operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources;\n\u25cf\nthe rate of production of reserves, if any;\n\u25cf\napproval of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u25cf\nselection of technology.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon oil and natural gas gathering and transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties, and the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our revenue.\nThe unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay production from our wells. The availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for, and supply of, oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. We may be required to shut-in wells for lack of a market or because of inadequacy or unavailability of pipeline or gathering system capacity. If that were to occur, we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until production arrangements were made to deliver our production to market. Furthermore, if we were required to shut-in wells we might also be obligated to pay shut-in royalties to certain mineral interest owners in order to maintain our leases. We do not expect to purchase firm transportation capacity on third-party facilities. Therefore, we expect the transportation of our production to be generally interruptible in nature and lower in priority to those having firm transportation arrangements.\nThe disruption of third-party facilities due to maintenance and/or weather could negatively impact our ability to market and deliver our products. The third parties control when or if such facilities are restored and what prices will be charged. Federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport oil and natural gas.\nStrategic relationships, including with MIE Holdings, STXRA, and GGE, upon which we may rely, are subject to risks and uncertainties which may adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nOur ability to explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas resources successfully and acquire oil and natural gas interests and acreage depends on our developing and maintaining close working relationships with industry participants and on our ability to select and evaluate suitable acquisition opportunities in a highly competitive environment. These realities are subject to risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo develop our business, we will endeavor to use the business relationships of our management and board to enter into strategic relationships, which may take the form of contractual arrangements with other oil and natural gas companies, including those that supply equipment and other resources that we expect to use in our business. For example, we have entered into a strategic relationship with MIE Holdings pursuant to which MIE Holdings has acquired equity in us and loaned us funds pursuant to a subordinated promissory note, and have both retained STXRA as a key advisor for our exploration and drilling efforts, and formed Pacific Energy Technology Services, LLC as a jointly-owned technical services venture with STXRA to provide acquisition, engineering, and oil drilling and completion technology services in the United States and abroad. We have also entered into a strategic relationship with GGE, a subsidiary of a New York-based investment management group with more than $1.3 billion in assets under management specializing in resource investment, whereby GGE has become our equal working interest partner in our Kazakhstan asset, and its affiliate RJ Credit has agreed to provided us with a $15.5 million drilling facility, of which $13.5 million is currently available, subject to various conditions and requirements (as described in greater detail above in the risk factor entitled \u201cOur ability to borrow additional funds under the senior debt facility is subject to certain requirements and limitations set forth in our senior debt facility\u201d). We may not be able to establish these strategic relationships, or if established, we may not be able to maintain them. In addition, the dynamics of our relationships with strategic partners may require us to incur expenses or undertake activities we would not otherwise be inclined to incur in order to fulfill our obligations to these partners or maintain our relationships. If our strategic relationships are not established or maintained, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAn increase in the differential between the NYMEX or other benchmark prices of oil and natural gas and the wellhead price we receive for our production could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe prices that we will receive for our oil and natural gas production sometimes may reflect a discount to the relevant benchmark prices, such as NYMEX, that are used for calculating hedge positions. The difference between the benchmark price and the prices we receive is called a differential. Increases in the differential between the benchmark prices for oil and natural gas and the wellhead price we receive could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not have, and may not have in the future, any derivative contracts covering the amount of the basis differentials we experience in respect of our production. As such, we will be exposed to any increase in such differentials.\nOur success depends, to a large extent, on our ability to retain our key personnel, including our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and our President and Chief Financial Officer, and the loss of any of our key personnel could disrupt our business operations.\nInvestors in our common stock must rely upon the ability, expertise, judgment and discretion of our management and the success of our technical team in identifying, evaluating and developing prospects and reserves. Our performance and success are dependent to a large extent on the efforts and continued employment of our management and technical personnel, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frank C. Ingriselli, and our President and Chief Financial Officer, Michael L. Peterson. We do not believe that they could be quickly replaced with personnel of equal experience and capabilities, and their successors may not be as effective. If Mr. Ingriselli, Mr. Peterson, or any of our other key personnel resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and if they are not adequately replaced, our business operations could be adversely affected. Except for a $3 million insurance policy on the life of Mr. Ingriselli, we do not currently maintain any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals. Further, pursuant to the promissory notes issued pursuant to that certain Note Purchase Agreement, dated March 7, 2014, entered into by and between us and certain investors in connection with our Continental Acquisition and creation of our $15.5 million drilling facility with RJ Credit, the investors have the right to require us to prepay the entire amount due under the notes if either Mr. Ingriselli or Mr. Peterson cease to be involved in the management of the Company or any subsidiary (except due to death, disability, removal by the Board of Directors, or resignation in order to serve his church, and if a replacement acceptable to the holders is appointed to replace such individual), subject to certain exceptions. Accordingly, the failure of either Mr. Ingriselli or Mr. Peterson to be involved with our management could result in us being required to prepay such debt prior to maturity, which could materially adversely affect us and disrupt our business operations.\nWe have an active board of directors that meets several times throughout the year and is intimately involved in our business and the determination of our operational strategies. Our board of directors work closely with management to evaluate potential prospects, funding sources, acquisitions and areas for further development. One of our directors has been involved with us since our inception and all of our directors have a deep understanding of our operations and culture. If any of our directors resign or become unable to continue in their present role, it may be difficult to find replacements with the same knowledge and experience and as a result, our operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to execute our business plan in a timely fashion.\nBecause of our small size, growth in accordance with our business plans, if achieved, will place a significant strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. As we expand our activities, including our planned increase in oil exploration, development and production, and increase the number of projects we are evaluating or in which we participate, there will be additional demands on our financial, technical and management resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties, including the inability to recruit and retain experienced managers, geoscientists, petroleum engineers and landmen could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to execute our business plan in a timely fashion.\nFinancial difficulties encountered by our oil and natural gas purchasers, third-party operators or other third parties could decrease our cash flow from operations and adversely affect the exploration and development of our prospects and assets.\nWe will derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of our oil and natural gas to unaffiliated third-party purchasers, independent marketing companies and mid-stream companies. Any delays in payments from our purchasers caused by financial problems encountered by them will have an immediate negative effect on our results of operations.\nLiquidity and cash flow problems encountered by our working interest co-owners or the third-party operators of our non-operated properties may prevent or delay the drilling of a well or the development of a project. Our working interest co-owners may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due. In the case of a farmout party, we would have to find a new farmout party or obtain alternative funding in order to complete the exploration and development of the prospects subject to a farmout agreement. In the case of a working interest owner, we could be required to pay the working interest owner\u2019s share of the project costs. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain the capital necessary to fund either of these contingencies or that we would be able to find a new farmout party.\nThe calculated present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows as included in our public filings is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves. We generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on current costs held constant over time without escalation and on commodity prices using an unweighted arithmetic average of first-day-of-the-month index prices, appropriately adjusted, for the 12-month period immediately preceding the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used for these estimates and will be affected by factors such as:\n\u25cf\nactual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nactual cost and timing of development and production expenditures;\n\u25cf\nthe amount and timing of actual production; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nIn addition, the 10% discount factor that is required to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes under GAAP is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on the cost of capital in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness which could reduce our financial flexibility, increase interest expense and adversely impact our operations and our unit costs.\nIn the future, we may incur significant amounts of additional indebtedness in order to make acquisitions or to develop our properties. Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u25cf\na significant portion of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness;\n\u25cf\na high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf\nany covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness could limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n\u25cf\na high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness may prevent us from pursuing; and\n\u25cf\ndebt covenants to which we may agree may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry.\nA high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the principal or interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. If we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to arrange financing, we may have to sell significant assets or have a portion of our assets foreclosed upon which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel.\nOur ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, and many of our competitors have more established presences in the United States than we have. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. In addition, other companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. The cost to attract and retain qualified personnel has increased in recent years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur competitors may use superior technology and data resources that we may be unable to afford or that would require a costly investment by us in order to compete with them more effectively.\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology, including the introduction of new products and services using new technologies and databases. As our competitors use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost. In addition, many of our competitors will have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us. One or more of the technologies that we will use or that we may implement in the future may become obsolete, and we may be adversely affected.\nIf we do not hedge our exposure to reductions in oil and natural gas prices, we may be subject to significant reductions in prices. Alternatively, we may use oil and natural gas price hedging contracts, which involve credit risk and may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant fluctuations in our profitability.\nIn the event that we choose not to hedge our exposure to reductions in oil and natural gas prices by purchasing futures and by using other hedging strategies, we may be subject to significant reduction in prices which could have a material negative impact on our profitability. Alternatively, we may elect to use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations. While the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines, their use also may limit future revenues from price increases. Hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations.\nEnvironmental and overall public scrutiny focused on the oil and gas industry is increasing. The current trend is to increase regulations of our operations in the industry. We are subject to federal, state, and local government regulation and liability, including complex environmental laws, which could require significant expenditures and/or adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur exploration, development, production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state, and local levels. Environmental and other governmental laws and regulations have increased our costs to plan, design, drill, install, operate and abandon natural gas and crude oil wells. Similar to other companies in our industry, we incur substantial operating and capital costs to comply with such laws and regulations. These compliance costs may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to larger companies in the industry which can spread such additional costs over a greater number of wells and larger operating staff. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years-particularly with respect to hydraulic fracturing-and environmental organizations have opposed, with some success, certain drilling projects.\nMatters subject to regulation include discharge permits, drilling bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties, taxation or environmental matters and health and safety criteria addressing worker protection. Under these laws and regulations, we may be required to make large expenditures that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These expenditures could include payments for:\n\u25cf\npersonal injuries;\n\u25cf\nproperty damage;\n\u25cf\ncontainment and cleanup of oil and other spills;\n\u25cf\nthe management and disposal of hazardous materials;\n\u25cf\nremediation and clean-up costs; and\n\u25cf\nother environmental damages.\nWe do not believe that full insurance coverage for all potential damages is available at a reasonable cost. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties, injunctive relief and/or the imposition of investigatory or other remedial obligations. Laws, rules and regulations protecting the environment have changed frequently and the changes often include increasingly stringent requirements. These laws, rules and regulations may impose liability on us for environmental damage and disposal of hazardous materials even if we were not negligent or at fault. We may also be found to be liable for the conduct of others or for acts that complied with applicable laws, rules or regulations at the time we performed those acts. These laws, rules and regulations are interpreted and enforced by numerous federal and state agencies. In addition, private parties, including the owners of properties upon which our wells are drilled or the owners of properties adjacent to or in close proximity to those properties, may also pursue legal actions against us based on alleged non-compliance with certain of these laws, rules and regulations.\nAdditionally, the natural gas and crude oil regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase our financial and managerial costs to comply with the requirements of these laws and regulations and, consequently, adversely affect our profitability. At the state level, for instance, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (\u201cCOGCC\u201d) issued a new rule governing mandatory minimum spacing, or setbacks, between oil and gas wells and occupied buildings and other areas. Similarly, it is expected that the COGCC may undertake a rulemaking focused on wellbore integrity in the near future that would increase requirements in this area. The COGCC has also recently concluded a rulemaking that will require baseline sampling of certain ground and surface water in most areas of Colorado. These new sampling requirements could increase the costs of developing wells in certain locations. In addition to increasing costs of operation, these rules could prevent us from drilling wells on certain locations we plan to develop, thereby reducing our reserves as well as our future revenues. In addition, the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment is expected to undertake a potentially expansive new rule regulating methane and other air emissions at oil and gas facilities in the State.\nSome local governmental bodies, for instance Longmont, Colorado, have adopted or are considering regulations regarding, among other things, land use, requirements for the posting of bonds to secure restoration obligations and limitations on hydraulic fracturing and other drilling activities, and these regulations may limit, delay or prohibit exploration and development activities or make those activities more expensive. Additionally, state and local governments are undertaking air quality studies to assess potential public health impacts from oil and gas operations. These studies may result in the imposition of additional regulatory requirements on oil and gas operations.\nThe BP crude oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and generally heightened industry scrutiny has resulted and may result in new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. The EPA has recently focused on citizen concerns about the risk of water contamination and public health problems from drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities, and conducted public meetings around the country on this issue which have been well publicized and well attended. This renewed focus could lead to additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our drilling, fracturing and other operations.\nOther potential laws and regulations affecting us include new or increased severance taxes proposed in several states. This could adversely affect the existing operations in these states and the economic viability of future drilling. Additional laws, regulations or other changes could significantly reduce our future growth, increase our costs of operations and reduce our cash flows, in addition to undermining the demand for the natural gas and crude oil we produce.\nPart of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques. The results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to drilling and completion technique risks, and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production. As a result, we may incur material write-downs and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline if drilling results are unsuccessful.\nOur operations in the D-J Basin in Weld and Morgan Counties, Colorado, involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques in order to maximize cumulative recoveries and therefore generate the highest possible returns. Risks that we may face while drilling include, but are not limited to, landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone, staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation, running our casing the entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore. Risks that we may face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.\nThe results of our drilling in new or emerging formations will be more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas.\nUltimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, access to gathering systems and limited takeaway capacity or otherwise, and/or natural gas and oil prices decline, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate. Further, as a result of any of these developments we could incur material write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nOur acreage must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within three to five years, in order to hold the acreage by production. In the highly competitive market for acreage, failure to drill sufficient wells in order to hold acreage will result in a substantial lease renewal cost, or if renewal is not feasible, loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities.\nOur leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a primary term of three to five years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres. The loss of substantial leases could have a material adverse effect on our assets, operations, revenues and cash flow and could cause the value of our securities to decline in value.\nCompetition and regulation of hydraulic fracturing services and water disposal could impede our ability to develop our shale plays.\nThe unavailability or high cost of high pressure pumping services (or hydraulic fracturing services), chemicals, proppant, water and water disposal and related services and equipment could limit our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget. The oil and natural gas industry is experiencing a growing emphasis on the exploitation and development of shale natural gas and shale oil resource plays, which are dependent on hydraulic fracturing for economically successful development. Hydraulic fracturing in shale plays requires high pressure pumping service crews. A shortage of service crews or proppant, chemical, water or water disposal options, especially if this shortage occurred in eastern Colorado, could materially and adversely affect our operations and the timeliness of executing our development plans within our budget. There is significant regulatory uncertainty as some states have begun to regulate hydraulic fracturing and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, is currently conducting studies on the issue. The results of these studies could affect the current regulatory jurisdiction of the states and increase the cycle times and costs to receive permits, delay or possibly preclude receipt of permits in certain areas, impact water usage and waste water disposal and require chemical additives disclosures.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local taxes, and may become subject to new taxes or have eliminated or reduced certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production activities as a result of future legislation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe federal, state and local governments in the areas in which we operate impose taxes on the oil and natural gas products we sell and, for many of our wells, sales and use taxes on significant portions of our drilling and operating costs. In the past, there has been a significant amount of discussion by legislators and presidential administrations concerning a variety of energy tax proposals. Many states have raised state taxes on energy sources, and additional increases may occur. Changes to tax laws that are applicable to us could adversely affect our business and our financial results.\nPeriodically, legislation is introduced to eliminate certain key U.S. federal income tax preferences currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Such possible changes include, but are not limited to, (a) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (b) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (c) the elimination of the deduction for certain United States production activities, and (d) the increase in the amortization period for geological and geophysical costs paid or incurred in connection with the exploration for, or development of, oil or natural gas within the United States. It is unclear whether any such changes will actually be enacted or, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of the budget proposals or any other similar change in U.S. federal income tax law could affect certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe derivatives legislation adopted by Congress, and implementation of that legislation by federal agencies, could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nOn July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other things, sets forth the new framework for regulating certain derivative products including the commodity hedges of the type that we may elect to use, but many aspects of this law are subject to further rulemaking and will take effect over several years. As a result, it is difficult to anticipate the overall impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our ability or willingness to enter into and maintain such commodity hedges and the terms of such hedges. There is a possibility that the Dodd-Frank Act could have a substantial and adverse impact on our ability to enter into and maintain these commodity hedges. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act could result in the implementation of position limits and additional regulatory requirements on derivative arrangements, which could include new margin, reporting and clearing requirements. In addition, this legislation could have a substantial impact on our counterparties and may increase the cost of our derivative arrangements in the future.\nIf these types of commodity hedges become unavailable or uneconomic, our commodity price risk could increase, which would increase the volatility of revenues and may decrease the amount of credit available to us. Any limitations or changes in our use of derivative arrangements could also materially affect our future ability to conduct acquisitions.\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and water disposal could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nCongress has considered, but has not yet passed, legislation to amend the federal Safe Drinking Water Act to remove the exemption from restrictions on underground injection of fluids near drinking water sources granted to hydraulic fracturing operations and require reporting and disclosure of chemicals used by oil and natural gas companies in the hydraulic fracturing process. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or other propping agents and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate natural gas production. We routinely use hydraulic fracturing to produce commercial quantities of oil, liquids and natural gas from shale formations. Sponsors of bills, which have been subject to various proceedings in the legislative process, including the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies and otherwise cause adverse environmental impacts. Such legislation, if adopted, could increase the possibility of litigation and establish an additional level of regulation at the federal level that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could, and in all likelihood would, result in additional regulatory burdens, making it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing operations and increasing our costs of compliance.\nIn addition, certain members of Congress have called upon the U.S. Government Accountability Office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the natural-gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural-gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration to provide a better understanding of that agency\u2019s estimates regarding natural-gas reserves, including reserves from shale formations, as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates. Depending on the outcome of these studies, federal and state legislatures and agencies may seek to further regulate hydraulic fracturing activities.\nThe EPA is also involved in regulating hydraulic fracturing. On April 17, 2012, the EPA approved final rules under the Clean Air Act that would subject all oil and gas operations (production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution) to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) programs. These rules also include NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells. These standards include the reduced emission completion (REC) techniques developed in EPA\u2019s Natural Gas STAR program along with pit flaring of gas not sent to the gathering line. The standards would be applicable to newly drilled and fractured wells as well as existing wells that are refractured. Further, the proposed regulations under NESHAPS include maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards for those glycol dehydrators and storage vessels at major sources of hazardous air pollutants not currently subject to MACT standards. While these rules have been finalized, many of the rule\u2019s provisions will be phased-in over time, with the more stringent requirements like REC not becoming effective until 2015. The new rules are substantial and may increase future costs of our operations and are likely to require us to make modifications to our operations and install new equipment.\nMoreover, the EPA is conducting a comprehensive research study on the potential adverse impacts that hydraulic fracturing may have on drinking water and groundwater. In addition, in December 2011, the EPA published an unrelated draft report concluding that hydraulic fracturing caused groundwater pollution of a natural gas field in Wyoming, although this study remains subject to review and public comments. Consequently, even if federal legislation is not adopted soon or at all, the performance of the hydraulic fracturing study by the EPA could spur further action at a later date towards federal legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing or similar production operations.\nIn addition, a number of states are considering or have implemented more stringent regulatory requirements applicable to fracturing, which could include, among other requirements, stringent permitting on air emission control requirements, disclosure, wastewater disposal, baseline sampling, well construction and well location requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban injection of fracturing wastewater, and effectively prohibit further production of natural gas through the use of hydraulic fracturing or similar operations. For example, Texas has adopted legislation that requires the disclosure of information regarding the substances used in the hydraulic fracturing process to the Railroad Commission of Texas and the public. Some municipalities and local governments, including most recently the cities of Longmont, Boulder, Fort Collins, and Lafayette, Colorado, have adopted or are considering similar actions. This legislation and any implementing regulation could increase our costs of compliance and doing business.\nThe adoption of new laws or regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, the hydraulic fracturing and related water disposal processes could make it more difficult to complete oil and natural gas wells in shale formations. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing becomes regulated at the federal level as a result of federal legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA, fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements, and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in cost, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil we produce while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nOn December 15, 2009, the EPA published its final findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d present an endangerment to public health and welfare because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings allow the EPA to adopt and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. Accordingly, the EPA has adopted regulations that would require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and permitting and presumably requiring a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary sources. In addition, on October 30, 2009, the EPA published a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. On November 30, 2010, the EPA released a final rule that expands its rule on reporting of greenhouse gas emissions to include owners and operators of petroleum and natural gas systems. The adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. Further, various states have adopted legislation that seeks to control or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from a wide range of sources. Any such legislation could adversely affect demand for the natural gas, oil and liquids that we produce.\nSome scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process-related services provided by midstream companies, service companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses, or costs that may result from potential physical effects of climate change.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking processes. Our operations could be adversely impacted if we are unable to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations. Currently, the quantity of water required in certain completion operations, such as hydraulic fracturing, and changing regulations governing usage may lead to water constraints and supply concerns (particularly in some parts of the country). Colorado and other western states have recently experienced a drought. As a result, future availability of water from certain sources used in the past may be limited. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and conditions could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas. The federal Clean Water Act, or CWA and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas waste, into navigable waters or other regulated federal and state waters. Permits or other approvals must be obtained to discharge pollutants to regulated waters and to conduct construction activities in such waters and wetlands. Uncertainty regarding regulatory jurisdiction over wetlands and other regulated waters has, and will continue to, complicate and increase the cost of obtaining such permits or other approvals. The CWA and analogous state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges of reportable quantities of oil and other hazardous substances. Many state discharge regulations, and the Federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System General permits issued by the EPA, prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the oil and natural gas industry into coastal waters. While generally exempt under federal programs, many state agencies have also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. In October 2011, the EPA announced its intention to develop federal pretreatment standards for wastewater discharges associated with hydraulic fracturing activities. If adopted, the pretreatment rules will require coalbed methane and shale gas operations to pretreat wastewater before transferring it to treatment facilities Some states have banned the treatment of fracturing wastewater at publicly owned treatment facilities. There has been recent nationwide concern over earthquakes associated with Class II underground injection control wells, a predominant storage method for crude oil and gas wastewater. It is likely that new rules and regulations will be developed to address these concerns, possibly eliminating access to Class II wells in certain locations, and increasing the cost of disposal in others. Finally, the EPA study noted above has focused and will continue to focus on various stages of water use in hydraulic fracturing operations. It is possible that, following the conclusion of the EPA\u2019s study, the agency will move to more strictly regulate the use of water in hydraulic fracturing operations. While we cannot predict the impact that these changes may have on our business at this time, they may be material to our business, financial condition, and operations. Compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells or the disposal or recycling of water will increase our operating costs and may cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted. In addition, our inability to meet our water supply needs to conduct our completion operations may impact our business, and any such future laws and regulations could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRestrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. Seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures.\nAs a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on September 9, 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to consider listing more than 250 species as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. The law prohibits the harming of endangered or threatened species, provides for habitat protection, and imposes stringent penalties for noncompliance. The final designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations, delays, or prohibitions on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.\nPotential conflicts of interest could arise for certain members of our management team that hold management positions with other entities.\nFrank C. Ingriselli, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, is also President and Chief Executive Officer of Global Venture Investments LLC and Michael L. Peterson, our President and Chief Financial Officer, is a managing partner of Pascal Management. We believe these positions require only an immaterial amount of Messrs. Ingriselli\u2019s and Peterson\u2019s time and will not conflict with each of their respective roles or responsibilities with our company. If either of these entities enters into one or more transactions with our company, or if either of these positions require significantly more time than currently anticipated, potential conflicts of interests could arise from Messrs. Ingriselli and Peterson performing services for us and these other entities.\nOur technology services company has no operating history and there is a risk that such company will not be successful or face liabilities.\nOn October 4, 2012, we established a technical services subsidiary, Pacific Energy Technology Services, LLC, which is 70% owned by us and 30% owned by STXRA, through which we plan to provide acquisition, engineering, and oil drilling and completion technology services in joint cooperation with STXRA in the United States and Pacific Rim countries. While Pacific Energy Technology Services, LLC currently has no operations, only nominal assets and liabilities and limited capitalization, we anticipate actively developing this venture in 2015. Due to the fact that this entity does not have an operating history and the fact that we have not previously provided technology services as part of its operations, there is a risk that we will not be successful in marketing this venture, that revenues will not develop and that Pacific Energy Technology Services, LLC will not be successful. We may be subject to liability claims from clients of our planned services. Our product liability insurance and contractual limitations may not cover all potential claims. Our failure to provide services at a level requested by clients could cause us to lose revenue, as well as to experience delay in or loss of market acceptance and sales, or injury to our reputation.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe currently have an illiquid and volatile market for our common stock, and the market for our common stock is and may remain illiquid and volatile in the future.\nWe currently have a highly sporadic, illiquid and volatile market for our common stock, which market is anticipated to remain sporadic, illiquid and volatile in the future. Factors that could affect our stock price or result in fluctuations in the market price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u25cf\nour actual or anticipated operating and financial performance and drilling locations, including reserves estimates;\n\u25cf\nquarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as net income per share, net income and cash flows, or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf\nchanges in revenue, cash flows or earnings estimates or publication of reports by equity research analysts;\n\u25cf\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u25cf\npublic reaction to our press releases, announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock by us or other shareholders, or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u25cf\nthe limited amount of our freely tradable common stock available in the public marketplace;\n\u25cf\ngeneral financial market conditions and oil and natural gas industry market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices;\n\u25cf\nthe realization of any of the risk factors presented in this Annual Report;\n\u25cf\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation;\n\u25cf\nthe prices of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe success of our exploration and development operations, and the marketing of any oil and natural gas we produce;\n\u25cf\nchanges in market valuations of companies similar to ours; and\n\u25cf\ndomestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT under the symbol \u201cPED.\u201d Our stock price may be impacted by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rates or international currency fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Due to the limited volume of our shares which trade, we believe that our stock prices (bid, ask and closing prices) may not be related to our actual value, and not reflect the actual value of our common stock. Shareholders and potential investors in our common stock should exercise caution before making an investment in us.\nAdditionally, as a result of the illiquidity of our common stock, investors may not be interested in owning our common stock because of the inability to acquire or sell a substantial block of our common stock at one time. Such illiquidity could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, a shareholder may not be able to borrow funds using our common stock as collateral because lenders may be unwilling to accept the pledge of securities having such a limited market. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or, if one develops, be sustained.\nAn active liquid trading market for our common stock may not develop in the future.\nOur common stock currently trades on the NYSE MKT, although our common stock\u2019s trading volume is very low. Liquid and active trading markets usually result in less price volatility and more efficiency in carrying out investors\u2019 purchase and sale orders. However, our common stock may continue to have limited trading volume, and many investors may not be interested in owning our common stock because of the inability to acquire or sell a substantial block of our common stock at one time. Such illiquidity could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, a shareholder may not be able to borrow funds using our common stock as collateral because lenders may be unwilling to accept the pledge of securities having such a limited market. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or, if one develops, be sustained.\nWe do not presently intend to pay any cash dividends on or repurchase any shares of our common stock.\nWe do not presently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock or to repurchase any shares of our common stock. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Cash dividend payments in the future may only be made out of legally available funds and, if we experience substantial losses, such funds may not be available. Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of your common stock in order to generate cash flow from your investment, and there is no guarantee that the price of our common stock that will prevail in the market will ever exceed the price paid by you.\nThe issuance of common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes will cause immediate and substantial dilution.\nThe issuance of common stock upon conversion of our outstanding convertible bridge notes in the aggregate amount of $475,000 in principal and $48,000 of payment in kind, along with interest on the principal amount of such notes, which allow the holders thereof the right to convert such amounts from time to time, subject to certain limitations, into common stock of the Company, as is determined by dividing the amount converted by a conversion price as follows (A) prior to June 1, 2014, the conversion price is $2.15 per share; and (B) following June 1, 2014, the denominator used in the calculation described above shall be the greater of (i) 80% of the average of the closing price per share of our publicly traded common stock for the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the date of the conversion notice provide by the holder; and (ii) $0.50 per share, will result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders.\nIn addition, if we do not repay that certain Amended and Restated Secured Subordinated Promissory Note, principal amount $4.925 million, dated February 19, 2015, issued by the Company to MIE Jurassic Energy Corporation (\u201cMIEJ\u201d) in full on or before March 8, 2017, MIEJ has the right to convert the outstanding balance plus accrued and unpaid interest, into common stock of the Company at a price equal to 80% of the average closing price per share of common stock over the then previous 60 days from the date MIEJ exercises its conversion right, subject to a floor price of $0.30 per share of common stock, receipt of additional listing approval for the shares of common stock to be issued from the NYSE MKT, and the requirement that the Company obtain shareholder approval of any issuances of common stock that would result in more than 19.9% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock or voting stock being issued in aggregate upon the conversion of such note. Any such issuances of common stock will result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders.\nThe continuously adjustable conversion price feature of our convertible notes could require us to issue a substantially greater number of shares, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and cause dilution to our existing stockholders.\nOur existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution of their investment upon conversion of the convertible bridge notes and New MIEJ Note. The convertible bridge notes are convertible into shares of common stock as described in the risk factor above entitled \u201cThe issuance of common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes will cause immediate and substantial dilution\u201d, at a discount to the trading price of our common stock, subject to a floor of $0.50 per share, and the New MIEJ Note is convertible into shares of common stock as described in the same risk factor after March 8, 2017 at a discount to the trading price of our common stock, subject to a floor of $0.30 per share and other restrictions. As a result, the number of shares issuable could prove to be significantly greater in the event of a decrease in the trading price of our common stock, which decrease could cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. As sequential conversions and sales take place, the price of our common stock may decline, and if so, the holders of the convertible bridge notes and New MIEJ Note would be entitled to receive an increasing number of shares, which could then be sold, triggering further price declines and conversions for even larger numbers of shares, which would cause additional dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nBecause we are a small company, the requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company with listed equity securities, we must comply with the federal securities laws, rules and regulations, including certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and the Dodd-Frank Act, related rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE MKT, with which a private company is not required to comply. Complying with these laws, rules and regulations will occupy a significant amount of time of our Board of Directors and management and will significantly increase our costs and expenses, which we cannot estimate accurately at this time. Among other things, we must:\n\u25cf\nestablish and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u25cf\ncomply with rules and regulations promulgated by the NYSE MKT;\n\u25cf\nprepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws;\n\u25cf\nmaintain various internal compliance and disclosures policies, such as those relating to disclosure controls and procedures and insider trading in our common stock;\n\u25cf\ninvolve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities;\n\u25cf\nmaintain a comprehensive internal audit function; and\n\u25cf\nmaintain an investor relations function.\nIn addition, being a public company subject to these rules and regulations may require us to accept less director and officer liability insurance coverage than we desire or to incur substantial costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers.\nFuture sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly. The perception in the public market that our shareholders might sell shares of our common stock could also depress the market price of our common stock. Up to $100,000,000 in total aggregate value of securities have been registered by us on a \u201cshelf\u201d registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-191869) that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 23, 2013, and which was declared effective on November 5, 2013. To date, an aggregate of $14,705,000 in securities have been sold by us under the Form S-3, leaving $85,295,000 in securities which will be eligible for sale in the public markets from time to time, when sold and issued by us, subject to the requirements of Form S-3, which limits us, until such time, if ever, as our public float exceeds $75 million, from selling securities in a public primary offering under Form S-3 with a value exceeding more than one-third of the aggregate market value of the common stock held by non-affiliates of the Company every twelve months. Additionally, if our existing shareholders sell, or indicate an intent to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. The market price for shares of our common stock may drop significantly when such securities are sold in the public markets. A decline in the price of shares of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities.\nOur outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2014, there were outstanding stock options to purchase approximately 1,827,224 shares of our common stock and outstanding warrants to purchase approximately 6,594,129 shares of common stock. For the life of the options and warrants, the holders have the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock without assuming the risk of ownership. The issuance of shares upon the exercise of outstanding securities will also dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.\nThe availability of these shares for public resale, as well as any actual resales of these shares, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We previously filed registration statements with the SEC on Form S-8 providing for the registration of an aggregate of approximately 7,218,386 shares of our common stock issuable or reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans. Subject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions, the expiration of lockup agreements, any management 10b5-1 plans and certain restrictions on sales by affiliates, shares registered under registration statements on Form S-8 will be available for resale immediately in the public market without restriction.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of outstanding options or warrants or conversion of other securities, or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock may have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nFive of our directors and executive officers own approximately 13.7% of our common stock, and two of our major shareholders own approximately 17.7% of our common stock, which may give them influence over important corporate matters in which their interests are different from your interests.\nFive of our directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately 13.7% of our outstanding shares of common stock, and our largest two non-director or officer shareholders own approximately 17.8% of our outstanding shares of common stock (excluding exercise of warrants held thereby) based on a total of 37,817,997 shares of common stock outstanding as of March 25, 2015. These directors, executive officers and major shareholders will be positioned to influence or control to some degree the outcome of matters requiring a shareholder vote, including the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of formation or bylaws and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. These directors, executive officers and major shareholders, subject to any fiduciary duties owed to the shareholders generally, may have interests different than the rest of our shareholders. Their influence or control of our company may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other shareholders. In addition, due to the ownership interest of these directors and officers in our common stock, they may be able to remain entrenched in their positions.\nProvisions of Texas law may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if it might be beneficial to our shareholders.\nProvisions of Texas law may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Under Texas law, a shareholder who beneficially owns more than 20% of our voting stock, or any \u201caffiliated shareholder,\u201d cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an affiliated shareholder, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our Board of Directors before this person became an affiliated shareholder or approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding voting shares not beneficially owned by the affiliated shareholder.\nOur Board of Directors can authorize the issuance of preferred stock, which could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock and make a change of control of our company more difficult even if it might benefit our shareholders.\nOur Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the voting powers, preferences and other rights and limitations of the preferred stock. Shares of preferred stock may be issued by our Board of Directors without shareholder approval, with voting powers and such preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and powers as determined by our Board of Directors, which may be greater than the shares of common stock currently outstanding. As a result, shares of preferred stock may be issued by our Board of Directors which cause the holders to have majority voting power over our shares, provide the holders of the preferred stock the right to convert the shares of preferred stock they hold into shares of our common stock, which may cause substantial dilution to our then common stock shareholders and/or have other rights and preferences greater than those of our common stock shareholders including having a preference over our common stock with respect to dividends or distributions on liquidation or dissolution. To date our Board of Directors has authorized Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the rights and preferences associated therewith, and risks related to such preferred stock, is described in greater detail under \u201cRisks Related to Our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock\u201d.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the Board of Directors has the authority to issue additional shares of common stock and preferred stock, which could cause substantial dilution to our existing shareholders. Additionally, the dilutive effect of any preferred stock which we may issue may be exacerbated given the fact that such preferred stock may have voting rights and/or other rights or preferences which could provide the preferred shareholders with substantial voting control over us subsequent to the date of this filing and/or give those holders the power to prevent or cause a change in control, even if that change in control might benefit our shareholders. As a result, the issuance of shares of common stock and/or preferred stock may cause the value of our securities to decrease.\nSecurities analysts may not cover, or continue to cover, our common stock and this may have a negative impact on our common stock\u2019s market price.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over independent analysts (provided that we have engaged various non-independent analysts). We currently only have a few independent analysts that cover our common stock, and these analysts may discontinue coverage of our common stock at any time. Further, we may not be able to obtain additional research coverage by independent securities and industry analysts. If no independent securities or industry analysts continue coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock could be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our common stock, changes their opinion of our shares or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease and we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nShareholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through the issuance of securities.\nWherever possible, our Board of Directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash consideration will consist of shares of our common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. Our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the shareholders, subject to the requirements of the NYSE MKT (which generally require shareholder approval for any transactions which would result in the issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock), to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase such shares of common stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future. These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders and may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management\u2019s ability to maintain control of us, because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management.\nIf we are delisted from the NYSE MKT, your ability to sell your shares of our common stock may be limited by the penny stock restrictions, which could further limit the marketability of your shares.\nOn January 8, 2015, we received notice from the NYSE MKT LLC (the \u201cExchange\u201d) that we were not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide (\u201cCompany Guide\u201d) since we reported stockholders\u2019 equity of less than $6,000,000 at September 30, 2014 and had incurred net losses in our five most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2013. Receipt of the letter does not have any immediate effect upon the listing of our common stock, provided that in order to maintain our listing on the Exchange, the Exchange requested that we submit a plan of compliance (the \u201cPlan\u201d) by February 9, 2015 addressing how we intend to regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the Company Guide by July 8, 2016. We submitted our Plan to the Exchange by the requested deadline, and such plan was accepted by the Exchange on March 10, 2015. In connection with such acceptance, we have been provided until July 8, 2016 to regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the Company Guide, which requires our stockholders\u2019 equity to be at least $6 million. If we do not make progress consistent with the Plan during the Plan period or regain compliance with the applicable continued listing standards of the Exchange by July 8, 2016, the Exchange will initiate delisting proceedings as appropriate. We believe that as a result of the recent consummation of the D-J Basin Asset Acquisition, our stockholders\u2019 equity now meets and exceeds the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity threshold required, and are hopeful that the Exchange will confirm our regained compliance with the Exchange\u2019s continued listing standards in the near future. In any event, we are confident that we will be able to regain compliance with applicable listing standards by July 8, 2016, provided that if we are unable to regain compliance, our common stock will be delisted from the Exchange.\nIf our common stock is delisted, it could come within the definition of \u201cpenny stock\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act and could be covered by Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act. That Rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, Rule 15g-9, if it were to become applicable, would affect the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell our securities, and accordingly would affect the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the public market. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nDue to the fact that our common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT, we are subject to financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements which increase our costs and expenses.\nWe are currently required to file annual and quarterly information and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission that are specified in Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, due to the fact that our common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT, we are also subject to the requirements to maintain independent directors, comply with other corporate governance requirements and are required to pay annual listing and stock issuance fees. These obligations require a commitment of additional resources including, but not limited, to additional expenses, and may result in the diversion of our senior management\u2019s time and attention from our day-to-day operations. These obligations increase our expenses and may make it more complicated or time consuming for us to undertake certain corporate actions due to the fact that we may require NYSE approval for such transactions and/or NYSE rules may require us to obtain shareholder approval for such transactions.\nRisks Related to Our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock\nOur currently outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred stock provides the holder thereof a liquidation preference over our outstanding common stock.\nWe have designated 66,625 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock. The Series A Convertible Preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $400 per share. As a result, in the event we liquidate, dissolve or wind up, either voluntarily or involuntarily, the holder of our Series A Preferred stock would have the right to receive up to the first approximately $22.65 million left after the payment of our liabilities and creditors, which payment to the Series A Preferred holder would take priority over any amount that could be received by our common stock shareholders. The payment of the liquidation preference could result in common stock shareholders not receiving any consideration if we were to liquidate, dissolve or wind up, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Additionally, the existence of the liquidation preference may reduce the value of our common stock, make it harder for us to sell shares of common stock in offerings in the future, or prevent or delay a change of control. The liquidation preference of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock is automatically reduced to $0.001 per share ($66.62 in aggregate) at such time as our shareholders, consistent with the rules and requirements of the NYSE MKT and the Securities and Exchange Commission, approve the conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock and the transactions associated therewith (\u201cShareholder Approval\u201d). We agreed that, by May 24, 2015, extendable until up to July 8, 2015, in the event we are a party to a material corporate transaction that requires shareholder approval, we would file all required documentation with the Securities and Exchange Commission necessary to seek the Shareholder Approval.\nThe issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock will cause immediate and substantial dilution to existing shareholders.\nOur 66,625 outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock are not convertible into common stock until the Shareholder Approval is received. At such time as Shareholder Approval is received, (x) the Series A Convertible Preferred stock automatically ceases accruing dividends and all accrued and unpaid dividends are automatically forfeited and forgiven in their entirety, (y) the liquidation preference of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock is reduced to $0.001 per share, and (z) each share of Series A Convertible Preferred stock is convertible into common stock on a 1,000:1 basis (subject to certain limitations on conversions described in the Series A Preferred designation), subject to a lock-up that prohibits the holder from selling shares of common stock issuable upon conversion for less than $1 per share until February 23, 2016, provided further that no conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock is allowed in the event the holder thereof would beneficially own more than 9.99% of our common stock or voting stock.\nThe issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock will result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders since the holder of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock may ultimately receive and sell the full amount of shares issuable in connection with the conversion of such Series A Convertible Preferred stock. Although the Series A Convertible Preferred stock may not be converted if such conversion would cause the holder thereof to own more than 9.99% of our outstanding common stock, this restriction does not prevent the holder from converting some of its holdings, selling those shares, and then converting the rest of its holdings, while still staying below the 9.99% limit. In this way, the holder of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock could sell more than this limit while never actually holding more shares than this limit allows. If the holder of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock chooses to do this, it will cause substantial dilution to the then holders of our common stock.\nOur outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred stock accrues a cash dividend.\nOur 66,625 outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock accrue an annual dividend equal to 10% of the liquidation preference of such Series A Convertible Preferred stock (which liquidation preference is $400 per share or $22.65 million in aggregate), payable annually. In the event we fail to pay any required dividends such unpaid dividends accrue interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum until such default is cured. Notwithstanding the above, at such time as Shareholder Approval is received, the Series A Convertible Preferred stock automatically ceases accruing dividends and all accrued and unpaid dividends are automatically forfeited and forgiven in their entirety. We do not currently have unpaid accrued dividends on our Series A Convertible Preferred stock; however, to the extent we do in the future, we will not be able to pay any dividends on our common stock without first paying such accrued dividends (subject to the terms of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock described above). Consequently, the failure to pay dividends on our Series A Convertible Preferred stock restricts the actions that we may take with respect to our common stock. We may not have sufficient available cash to pay the dividends as they accrue, may be unable to obtain Shareholder Approval, and may be forced to pay penalties in connection with our failure to pay such dividends. The payment of the dividends, or our failure to timely pay the dividends when due, could reduce our available cash on hand, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cause the value of our stock to decline in value.\nWe may be required to issue additional shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock upon the occurrence of certain events.\nIn the event we repay the senior credit facility and redeem 15,000 of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shares (designated as the Tranche One Shares) by November 23, 2015 (nine (9) months from the closing of the transaction pursuant to which the Series A Convertible Preferred stock shares were issued), (i) 25,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock are automatically redeemed and repurchased by us for $0 per share, and (ii) the holder may request (but not require) that we redeem and repurchase (x) an additional 15,000 of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock shares (designated as the Tranche Two Shares)(or such portion thereof that is then outstanding) at a redemption price of $650 per share for a period of thirty (30) days following the twenty-fourth (24th) month anniversary of the closing, and (y) the Tranche Two Shares (or such portion thereof that is then outstanding) and 11,625 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock (which we refer to as the Tranche Three Shares) at a redemption price of $800 per share for a period of thirty (30) days following the thirty-sixth (36th) month anniversary of the closing (the \u201cHolder Redemption Requests\u201d). In the event we do not redeem and repurchase (or if we have assigned such right, another party has not redeemed or purchased) all such shares pursuant to the Holder Redemption Requests, the holder has no recourse against us, provided that if we (or if applicable, the third party) does not repurchase and redeem all such requested shares, and the average closing price of our common stock over the thirty (30) day period immediately preceding the third anniversary of the closing is below $0.80 per share, then we are required to issue the holder up to an additional 10,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock, pro-rated based on the actual number of shares we redeem and repurchase. Notwithstanding the potential obligation to issue up to an additional 10,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock as described above, because such obligation is triggered only if we first redeem 15,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock, at no time will more than the original 66,625 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock be outstanding.\nThe issuance and sale of common stock upon conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock may depress the market price of our common stock.\nIf sequential conversions of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock and sales of such converted shares take place, the price of our common stock may decline. The Series A Convertible Preferred stock may not be converted until or unless Shareholder Approval is received. Additionally, in the event we repay our senior credit facility and redeem the Tranche One Shares by November 23, 2015, the Tranche Two Shares are only convertible after February 23, 2017, and the Tranche Three Shares are only convertible after February 23, 2018. Additionally, until February 23, 2016, any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock may only be sold if the trading price of our common stock is above $1.00.\nIn addition, the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock may represent overhang that may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company\u2019s stock in the market than there is demand for that stock. When this happens the price of the company\u2019s stock will decrease, and any additional shares which shareholders attempt to sell in the market will only further decrease the share price. If the share volume of our common stock cannot absorb converted shares sold by the Series A Convertible Preferred stock holder, then the value of our common stock will likely decrease.\nThe holder of our Series A Convertible Preferred stock has the right to appoint two members to our Board of Directors.\nIn February 2015, by resolution of the Board of Directors, we formally increased the size of our Board of Directors from three (3) members to five (5) members. Pursuant to the designation of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock, we provided the holder thereof the right, upon notice to us, to appoint designees to fill the two (2) vacant seats, one of which must be an independent director as defined by applicable rules, provided that no designees have been appointed to date. The board appointment rights continue until the holder no longer holds any of the Tranche One Shares (defined above). The board appointment rights mean that assuming such rights are exercised; the common stock shareholders may only have the right to appoint 60% (three of five members) of our Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 14135, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "PED"}
