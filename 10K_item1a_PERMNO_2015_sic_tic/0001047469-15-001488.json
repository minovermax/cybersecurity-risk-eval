{"cik": "105076", "company": "WAUSAU PAPER CORP.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in Wausau Paper stock involves risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other reports that we file from time to time with the SEC. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if any of the following risks occur. In that case, the trading price of our common stock may decline. In addition to the following risk factors, you should carefully review the cautionary statement made under \"Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\" in Item 7.\nTHE INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL AWAY-FROM-HOME MARKET IN WHICH WE OPERATE IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND INCREASED COMPETITION COULD REDUCE OUR SALES AND PROFITABILITY.\nWe compete on the basis of the quality and performance of our products, customer service, product development activities, price, and distribution. All of our markets are highly competitive. Our competitors vary in size, and many have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. See Item 1 of this report for information regarding the number and identities of our competitors.\nOUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DOWNTURNS IN THE TARGET MARKETS THAT WE SERVE OR REDUCED DEMAND FOR THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS WE SELL.\nDemand for our products is often affected by general economic conditions as well as product-use trends in our target markets. These changes may result in decreased demand for our products. There may be periods during which demand for our products is insufficient to enable us to operate our production facilities in an economical manner. The occurrence of these conditions is beyond our ability to control and, if they occur, may have a significant impact on our sales and results of operations.\nCHANGES WITHIN THE PAPER INDUSTRY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.\nChanges in the identity, ownership structure, and strategic goals of our competitors and the emergence of new competitors in our target markets may harm our financial performance. New competitors may include foreign-based companies and commodity-based domestic producers who could enter our markets if they are unable to compete in their traditional markets.\nTHE COST OF RAW MATERIALS AND ENERGY USED TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS COULD INCREASE.\nRaw materials and packaging comprise approximately 39% of our cost of sales, with wastepaper, purchased parent rolls, and market pulp accounting for over 73% of this total. Raw material prices will change based on worldwide supply and demand. Market pulp price changes can occur due to worldwide consumption levels of wastepaper, market pulp production capacity, expansions or curtailments, inventory building or depletion, and market pulp changes related to wastepaper availability, environmental issues, or other variables.\nWe purchase the majority of our energy needs. Energy costs may fluctuate significantly due to increased worldwide consumption levels, disruptions in supply due to natural catastrophes or political turmoil, or decreased production capacity.\nWe may not be able to pass increased cost for raw materials or energy on to our customers if the market or existing agreements with our customers do not allow us to raise the prices of our finished products. Even if we are able to pass through increased cost of raw materials or energy, the resulting increase in the selling prices for our products could reduce the volume of products we sell and decrease our revenues. While we may try, from time to time, to hedge against price increases, we may not be successful in doing so.\nTHE FAILURE TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE THE OVERALL DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR NET INCOME.\nOur sales volume and net earnings may decrease if we do not satisfy new customer product preferences or fail to meet new technology demands of our customers.\nIF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR LARGER CUSTOMERS, OUR BUSINESS MAY BE HARMED.\nWe do not have long-term, fixed quantity supply agreements with our customers. Due to competition or other factors we may lose business from our customers, either partially or completely. The loss of one or more of our significant customers, or a substantial reduction of orders by any of our significant customers, could harm our business and results of operations. Moreover, our customers may vary their order levels significantly from period to period, and customers may not continue to place orders with us in the future at the same levels as in prior periods. In the event we lose any of our larger customers, we may not be able to replace that revenue source, which could harm our financial results.\nWE MAY BE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH ORGANIZED LABOR UNIONS.\nSome of our hourly production workforce is represented by labor unions. While we believe we have satisfactory relationships with the labor organizations that represent our employees, we cannot guarantee that labor-related disputes will not arise. Labor disputes could result in disruptions in production and could also cause increases in production costs, which could damage our relationships with our customers and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate, and retain talented, highly skilled personnel. Accomplishing this may be affected by fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, changes in our management or leadership, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. If we do not succeed in recruiting, retaining, and motivating our key employees and in attracting new key personnel, we may be unable to meet our business plan and, as a result, our revenue and profitability may decline. In addition, effective succession planning for our key personnel is important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nTHE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS MAY INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that govern discharges into the environment and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Environmental laws impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. We will continue to incur substantial capital and operating expenses in order to comply with current laws. Any changes in these laws or their interpretation by government agencies or the courts may significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating expenses and decrease the amount of funds available for investment in other areas of operation. In addition, we may be required to eliminate or mitigate any adverse effects on the environment caused by the release of hazardous materials, whether or not we had knowledge of, or were responsible for, such release. We may also incur liability for personal injury and property damages as a result of discharges into the environment. If costs or liabilities related to environmental compliance increase significantly, our consolidated financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWE MAY BE UNABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW OR SECURE SUFFICIENT CREDIT TO SIMULTANEOUSLY FUND OUR OPERATIONS, FINANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND SATISFY OTHER OBLIGATIONS.\nOur business is capital-intensive and requires significant expenditures for dispensers, manufacturing equipment, maintenance and new or enhanced equipment for environmental compliance matters, and to otherwise support our business strategies. We expect to meet all of our near- and longer-term cash needs from a combination of operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, our existing credit facility or other bank lines of credit, and other long-term debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from these sources or if we are unable to secure needed credit due to our performance or tighter credit markets, we could be unable to meet our near- and longer-term cash needs.\nTHE FLUCTUATIONS IN CANADIAN EXCHANGE RATE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nApproximately 9% of our sales volume ships to Canada, a portion of which is invoiced in Canadian dollars, while our costs of sales are U.S. dollar denominated. Consequently, we are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rate on the translation of Canadian dollar-based revenues to U.S. dollars. We use market price adjustments on our Canadian-based business to partially offset these exchange rate fluctuations.\nIF WE HAVE A CATASTROPHIC LOSS OR UNFORESEEN OR RECURRING OPERATIONAL PROBLEMS AT ANY OF OUR FACILITIES, WE COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT LOST PRODUCTION AND/OR COST INCREASES.\nOur papermaking and converting facilities and distribution warehouses may suffer catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, mechanical failure, or other natural or man-made events. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, delay or reduce shipments, reduce revenue, and result in significant expenses to repair or replace the facility. These expenses and losses may not be adequately covered by property or business interruption insurance. Even if covered by insurance, our inability to deliver our products to customers, even on a short-term basis, may cause us to lose market share on a more permanent basis.\nANY ACQUISITIONS, MAJOR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, FACILITY CLOSINGS, OR OTHER STRUCTURAL CHANGES MAY RESULT IN FINANCIAL RESULTS THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN EXPECTED.\nIn the normal course of business, we engage in discussions with third parties relating to the possible acquisition of additional facilities and may consider, from time to time, the acquisition or disposition of businesses. We may have difficulty integrating the acquisition of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies. We may also have difficulty integrating a new manufacturing facility into current operations. These difficulties can arise for a variety of reasons, including, the size and complexity of the acquisition, the retention of key employees, the retention of key customers, and the ability to integrate manufacturing systems and transfer our corporate culture to new employees and facilities.\nWe also continually review and may implement structural changes or invest in major capital projects designed to improve our operations or to reflect anticipated changes in long-term market conditions. In 2013, we completed an expansion project at our Harrodsburg, Kentucky manufacturing facility. As a result of this or similar future investments, our financial results may differ from the investment community's expectations in a given quarter, or over the long term.\nIF WE INCUR A MATERIAL WEAKNESS IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND STOCK PRICE.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC (collectively, \"Section 404\") require us to assess and report on our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year. In our most recent report under Section 404, which is included in Item 8 of this report, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Our independent registered public accounting firm has concurred with that assessment.\nIf we should develop a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If a material weakness occurs, it could adversely affect our financial reporting process and our financial statements. If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and our stock price.\nFUTURE CHANGES IN FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nA change in financial accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results. New accounting pronouncements may adversely affect our reported financial results in the future or require us to restate results we have already reported. New financial accounting standards or interpretations may require us to recognize additional expenses in the future or change the manner in which revenue or expense amounts currently recognized are determined. Such changes in recognition may result in lower reported net earnings and decreased equity or increased balance sheet liabilities, any of which may reduce the market price of our common stock or affect our compliance with various covenants relating to our indebtedness.\nFUTURE CHANGES IN TAX LAW OR OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE TAX CREDITS AND LOSS CARRYOVERS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPORTED RESULTS.\nA change in tax law or our ability to realize tax credits and loss carryovers may have a significant effect on our reported results. Deferred tax assets are regularly reviewed for recoverability, and a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of whether a valuation allowance is required is based on an analysis of all positive and negative evidence, including future earnings, changes in operations, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and tax strategies that could potentially change the likelihood of recoverability of a deferred tax asset.\nWE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT, UNEXPECTED LIABILITIES FROM CURRENT OR FUTURE CLAIMS, INCLUDING MATTERS NOW THREATENED OR IN LITIGATION.\nWe deal with claims that are threatened or made by third parties in the normal course of our business. Some claims result in formal administrative or legal proceedings in which the amounts claimed are significant. We assess each claim and make a judgment whether the claim will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations. Claims that we believe could have material adverse effect if not resolved in our favor, or other claims that we believe to be significant, are discussed in Item 3 of this report and in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the most recent fiscal year. Our reports do not disclose or discuss all claims of which we are aware. Our assessment of the materiality of any claim is based upon the amount involved, the underlying facts, and our assessment of the likelihood of a material adverse outcome. If our assessment of a claim as immaterial is not correct, we may not have\nmade adequate provision for such loss and our consolidated financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations could be impacted.\nTHE INCREASING COSTS OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEE AND RETIREE BENEFITS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS.\nOur net earnings and cash flow may be impacted by the amount of income or expense we expend for employee benefit plans. This is especially true for pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, which are dependent on such elements as actual plan asset returns and factors used to determine the value and current costs of plan benefit obligations. In addition, if medical costs were to rise at significantly faster rates than inflation, we may not be able to mitigate the rising costs of medical benefits. Increases to the costs of pensions, other post-retirement and medical benefits could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWE MAY BECOME INVOLVED IN CLAIMS CONCERNING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND WE COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION OR RELATED EXPENSES IN DEFENDING OUR OWN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR DEFENDING CLAIMS THAT WE INFRINGED THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS.\nNone of our product trademarks or patents are independently considered to be material to our business. However, taken together, we consider our intellectual property to be a material asset. We may lose market share and suffer a decline in our revenue and net earnings if we cannot successfully defend one or more trademarks or patents.\nWe do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of third parties. However, we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our products or services. In that event, we may be subject to significant claims for damages.\nAny litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. Claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into license agreements, which would reduce our operating margins, or in some cases, we may not be able to obtain license agreements on terms acceptable to us.\nWE RELY EXTENSIVELY ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS, MAINTAIN INFORMATION AND MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES. DISRUPTIONS IN THE AVAILABILITY OF OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE OUR CUSTOMERS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe have information technology controls in place to protect our proprietary information, employee, and customer data. Our business model does not include direct sales, so we do not have consumer credit card information. In the event the controls and protections we have in place fail to protect our information technology systems, disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee or investor information maintained in the ordinary course of our business, may occur. Any such event could cause damage to our reputation, loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in large expenditures to investigate or remediate, to recover data, to repair or replace networks or information systems, or to protect against similar future events.\nSIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDERS OR POTENTIAL SHAREHOLDERS MAY ATTEMPT TO EFFECT CHANGES AT THE COMPANY OR ACQUIRE CONTROL OVER THE COMPANY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nShareholders of the Company may engage in proxy solicitations, advance shareholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire control over the Company. Campaigns by shareholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term shareholder value through actions such as financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, stock repurchases, or sales of assets or the entire Company. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, potentially disrupting operations and diverting the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies. In addition, certain events, such as significant changes in our Board of Directors, may trigger change of control provisions under the terms of our credit facilities and certain agreements that we have in place with our executive officers. These change of control provisions, if triggered, could require us to immediately repay debt under our credit agreements and make significant payments to executive officers whose employment by the Company is terminated. As a result, shareholder campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nSOME ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN OUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS, AS WELL AS PROVISIONS OF WISCONSIN LAW, COULD IMPAIR A TAKEOVER ATTEMPT.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws, could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of Wausau Paper that is deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors. These include provisions that:\n\u2022 permit our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock with rights and preferences designated by our board, including stock with voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022 impose advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022 divide our Board of Directors into three classes of directors serving staggered terms;\n\u2022 allow the Board of Directors to fill any vacancies on our board;\n\u2022 under our articles of incorporation, prohibit us from entering into a \"business combination\" transaction with any person who acquires 10% of our voting stock at any time (an \"interested 10% shareholder\") unless certain \"fair price\" requirements are met or, in the alternative, either (a) two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote that are not held by the interested shareholder are voted for the transaction, or (b) the Board of Directors has approved the transaction;\n\u2022 under Wisconsin law, require that two-thirds of our voting stock must vote to approve any merger with another corporation, a share exchange, or the sale of substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022 under Wisconsin law, prohibit us from entering into a \"business combination\" transaction with an interested 10% shareholder for a period of three years from the date such person makes such an acquisition unless our Board of Directors had approved the business combination or the acquisition of shares before the date of the acquisition;\n\u2022 under Wisconsin law, prohibit us from entering into a \"business combination\" transaction with an interested 10% shareholder at any time after a period of three years from the date of becoming an interested 10% shareholder unless our Board of Directors had approved the acquisition of shares before the date of the acquisition, the business combination meets certain \"fair price\" requirements, or the business combination is approved by a majority of the shares entitled to vote which are not beneficially owned by the interested 10% shareholder;\n\u2022 under Wisconsin law, reduce the voting power of any shares held by a shareholder who holds in excess of 20% of the shares outstanding to 10% of the full voting power of the excess shares; and\n\u2022 require a vote by the holders of four-fifths of our outstanding shares to amend the provisions of our articles or bylaws described above. These provisions and similar provisions that could apply to us in the future may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price, or otherwise adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 81702, "SIC": 2621, "TIC": "WPP.2"}
