{"cik": "1485469", "company": "Tower International, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is subject to a number of risks. In addition to the various risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report, the following risk factors should be considered.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Industry and Our Business A downturn in the global economy could adversely affect demand for automobiles that are manufactured with our products and therefore, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The level of demand for our products depends primarily upon the level of consumer demand for new vehicles that are manufactured with our products. The global economic recession that began in 2008 and continued through 2009 had a significant adverse effect on our business, customers, and suppliers, and contributed to delayed and reduced purchases of automobiles, including those manufactured with our products. If the global economy were to take another significant downturn, depending upon its length, duration, and severity, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow would again be materially adversely affected.\nDemand for and pricing of our products is also subject to economic conditions and other factors (e.g., energy costs, fuel costs, climate change concerns, vehicle age, consumer spending and preferences, materials used in production, changing technology, etc.) present in the various domestic and international markets in which our products are sold.\nOur substantial international operations make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries. Our international operations include manufacturing facilities in Europe, China, and Brazil. For the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 48% of our revenues were derived from operations outside the United States. Our International operations are subject to various risks that could have a material adverse effect on those operations and our business as a whole, including, but not limited to, exposure to the following in certain locations:\n\u2022 local economic and political conditions;\n\u2022 local civil and social unrest, including any resultant acts of war, terrorism or similar events;\n\u2022 local public health issues;\n\u2022 local tax requirements and obligations;\n\u2022 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022 high inflationary conditions;\n\u2022 the risk of government-sponsored competition;\n\u2022 legal and regulatory concerns, including difficulty enforcing agreements and collecting receivables;\n\u2022 controls on the repatriation of cash, including the imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022 export and import restrictions;\n\u2022 the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;\n\u2022 labor disruptions and operational shutdowns;\n\u2022 natural and man-made disasters; and\n\u2022 local environmental regulations.\nAdditionally, the economic instability in Brazil and countries in which we operate in Europe could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as adversely affect our access to, and cost of, capital.\nWe may be unable to realize revenues represented by our awarded business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The realization of future revenues from awarded business is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including the number of vehicles that our customers will actually produce, the timing of that production, and the mix of options that our customers may choose.\nIn addition to not having a commitment from our customers regarding the minimum number of products they must purchase from us if we obtain awarded business, the terms and conditions of the agreements with our customers typically provide that they have the contractual right to unilaterally terminate our contracts with them without notice or with only limited notice. If such contracts are terminated by our customers, our ability to obtain compensation from our customers for such termination is generally limited to the direct out-of-pocket costs that we incurred for raw materials and work-in-progress, and in certain instances, un-depreciated capital expenditures.\nWe base a substantial part of our planning on the anticipated lifetime revenues of particular products. We calculate the lifetime revenues of a product by multiplying our expected price for a product by the forecasted production volume for that product during the length of time we expect the related vehicle to be in production. We use IHS, a third-party forecasting service, to provide long-term forecasts, which allow us to determine how long a vehicle is expected to be in production. If we over-estimate the production units or if a customer reduces its level of anticipated purchases of a particular platform as a result of reduced demand, our actual revenues for that platform may be substantially less than the lifetime revenues we had anticipated for that platform.\nTypically, it takes two to three years from the time a manufacturer awards a program until the program is launched and production begins. In many cases, we must commit substantial resources in preparation for production under awarded customer business well in advance of the customer\u2019s production start date. We cannot provide assurance that our results of operations will not be materially adversely affected in the future if we are unable to recover these types of pre-production costs related to our customers\u2019 cancellation of awarded business.\nWe are dependent upon large customers for current and future revenues. The loss of any of these customers, or the loss of market share by these customers, could have a material adverse effect on us. Our customers are major vehicle manufacturers. During 2014, our largest volume customers, Ford, Volkswagen, Chrysler, Volvo, Nissan, Fiat, Daimler, and Toyota accounted for 22%, 15%, 14%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, and 5% of our revenues, respectively. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to any of our large-volume customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows by reducing cash flows and limiting our ability to spread our fixed costs over a larger revenue base. A variety of reasons could lead to a reduction of sales to our customers, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 loss of awarded business;\n\u2022 reduced or delayed customer requirements;\n\u2022 OEMs\u2019 choosing to insource business that has been traditionally outsourced to us;\n\u2022 strikes or other work stoppages affecting customer production; or\n\u2022 reduced demand for our customers\u2019 products.\nThe automobile industry is highly cyclical and a downturn will adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Our business is directly related to the volume of automotive production. Automotive production and sales are highly cyclical and depend on general economic conditions and other factors, including interest rates, consumer confidence, consumer preferences, patterns of consumer spending, fuel costs, and the automobile replacement cycle. Automotive production and sales may fluctuate significantly from year-to-year and such\nfluctuations may give rise to changes in demand for our products. Because we have significant fixed production costs, declines in our customers\u2019 production levels can have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe highly cyclical nature of the automotive industry presents a risk that is outside our control and that cannot be accurately predicted. Moreover, a number of factors that we cannot reasonably predict could affect cyclicality in the automotive industry, and have affected cyclicality in the past. Decreases in demand for automobiles generally, or decreases in demand for our products in particular, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur operations in China are conducted through joint ventures, which have unique risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business and customer relationships. We have four joint ventures in China. In our joint ventures, we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. In joint ventures, we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our co-owners as well as with the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes or relationships deteriorate, our success in the joint venture could be materially adversely affected. The benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures.\nAt two of the joint ventures, our joint venture partner is also affiliated with the largest customer of the joint venture. As such, these partners may negotiate on behalf of customers of the joint venture for sales terms that may not be in the best interest of the joint venture.\nAdditional risks associated with joint ventures include one or more partners failing to satisfy contractual obligations, conflicts arising between us and any of our partners that could have a material adverse effect on customer relationships and business, and a change in ownership of any of our partners.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had an investment in our non-consolidated joint venture located in Ningbo, China of $7.8 million in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This balance will fluctuate depending on our proportionate share of earnings or losses in the joint venture. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d or \u201cGAAP\u201d) require that this investment be evaluated for impairment if certain unfavorable conditions are present. Significant declines in Ningbo\u2019s profitability or business outlook for an extended period may impact the fair value of our investment, which could result in an impairment of this investment and a reduction in our net income.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, we initiated the process to sell our equity interest in three of our joint ventures. At December 31, 2014, two of the joint ventures were classified as held for sale and have been presented as discontinued operations within this Annual Report in accordance with FASB ASC No. 205, Discontinued Operations. The third joint venture is accounted for under the equity method and therefore does not qualify for held for sale treatment and does not fall under the scope of FASB ASC No. 205. We cannot provide assurance that these divestitures will be executed as planned.\nForeign exchange rate fluctuations could cause a decline in our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We generate a significant portion of our revenues and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies will generally have an adverse effect on our reported sales and profits, while depreciation of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies will generally have a positive effect on reported revenues and profits.\nWe may use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to protect against certain foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial effect resulting from foreign currency variations. The gains or losses associated with hedging activities may adversely affect our results of operations. On October 17, 2014, we entered into a $200 million variable rate to fixed interest rate swap for a portion of our Term Loan and a\n\u20ac157.1 million cross currency swap based on the U.S. Dollar/Euro exchange rate of $1.2733 which was the prevailing rate at the time of the transaction to hedge our net investment in our European subsidiaries. The maturity date for both swap instruments is April 16, 2020. Refer to Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this foreign currency swap transaction.\nDeterioration in the United States and world economies could adversely affect our customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 ability to access the capital markets, which may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The capital and credit markets provide companies with liquidity to help operate and grow their businesses, beyond that which is provided by operating cash flows. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our customers by making it increasingly difficult for them to obtain financing for their businesses and for their customers to obtain financing for automobile purchases. Our OEM customers typically require significant financing for their respective businesses. In addition, our OEM customers typically have related finance companies that provide financing to their dealers and customers. These finance companies have historically been active participants in the securitization markets, which experienced severe disruptions during the global economic crisis. Our suppliers, as well as the other suppliers to our customers, may face similar difficulties in obtaining financing for their businesses. If capital is not available to our customers or suppliers, or if the cost of capital is prohibitively high, their businesses would be adversely affected, which could result in their restructuring or even reorganization or liquidation under applicable bankruptcy laws. Any such adverse effect on our customers or suppliers could materially and adversely affect our Company, either through loss of revenues from any of our customers so affected, or due to our inability to meet our commitments without excess expense, as a result of disruptions in supply caused by the suppliers so affected.\nFinancial difficulties experienced by any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on us if such customer were unable to pay for the products we provide or if we experienced a loss of, or material reduction in, business from such customer. As a result of such difficulties, we could experience lost revenues, significant write-offs of accounts receivable, significant impairment charges, or additional restructurings beyond the steps we have taken to date.\nAny acquisitions or divestitures we make could disrupt our business and materially harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may, from time to time, consider certain acquisitions or divestitures. Acquisitions and divestitures involve numerous risks, including identifying attractive target acquisitions, undisclosed risks affecting the target, difficulties integrating acquired businesses, the assumption of unknown liabilities, potential adverse effects on existing business relationships with current customers and suppliers, the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and decreased geographic diversification.\nWe cannot provide assurance that any acquisitions or divestitures will perform as planned or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow, or that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions that we undertake. Any such failure could seriously harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is underfunded and requires annual cash payments. If the performance of the assets in our pension plan does not meet our expectations, or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our required contributions may be higher than we expect. We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is underfunded. While this plan is frozen as the Predecessor Company ceased benefit accruals under the plan, the plan will require annual cash payments in order to meet our funding obligations, which adversely affects our cash flow.\nAdditionally, our earnings may be affected by the amount of income or expense recorded for our pension plan. GAAP requires that income or expense of a pension plan be calculated at the annual measurement date using actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the capital markets, interest rates, and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change these assumptions. These assumptions, along with the actual value of assets at the measurement date, will impact the calculation of pension expense for the year. Although GAAP expense and pension contributions are not directly related, the key economic\nindicators that affect GAAP expense also affect the amount of cash that we would contribute to our pension plan. The investment portfolio of the pension plan has experienced volatility. Because the values of these pension plan assets have fluctuated, and will fluctuate in response to changing market conditions, the amount of gains or losses that will be recognized in subsequent periods, the impact on the funded status of the pension plan, and the future minimum required contributions, if any, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe decreasing number of automotive parts suppliers and pricing pressures from our automotive customers could make it more difficult for us to compete in the highly competitive automotive industry. The automotive parts industry is highly competitive and bankruptcies and consolidation among automotive parts suppliers are reducing the number of competitors and resulting in larger competitors who benefit from purchasing and distribution economies of scale. Our inability to compete with these larger suppliers in the future could result in a reduction of, or inability to increase, revenues, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAlthough the overall number of competitors is decreasing due to ongoing industry consolidation, we face significant competition within each of our major product areas. The principal competitive factors include quality, global presence, service, cost, product performance, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation, and timely delivery. We also face significant competitive pricing pressures from our automotive customers. Because of their purchasing size, our automotive customers can influence market participants to compete on price terms. If we are not able to offset pricing reductions resulting from these pressures by improving operating efficiencies and reducing expenditures, those pricing reductions may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will be able to continue to compete in the highly competitive automotive industry or that increased competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe volatility of steel prices may adversely affect our results of operations. We utilize steel and various purchased steel products in virtually all of our products. We refer to the \u201cnet steel impact\u201d as the combination of the change in steel prices that are reflected in the price of our products, the change in the cost to procure steel from mills, and the change in our recovery of scrap steel (which we refer to as \u201coffal\u201d). Our strategy is to be economically neutral to steel pricing by having these factors offset each other. While we strive to achieve a neutral net steel impact, we are not always successful in achieving that goal, in large part due to timing differences. The timing of a change in the price for steel may occur in separate periods and if a change occurs, that change may have a disproportionate effect on our liquidity because of the time difference between our payment for steel and our collection of cash from customers. We tend to pay for replacement materials, which are more expensive when steel prices are rising, over a much shorter period. As a result, rising steel prices may cause us to draw greater than anticipated amounts from our credit lines to cover the cash flow cycle from our steel purchases to cash collection for related accounts receivable. This cash requirement for working capital is higher in periods when we are increasing our inventory quantities.\nA by-product of our production process is the generation of offal. We typically sell offal in secondary markets, which are similar to the steel markets. We generally share our recoveries from sales of offal with our customers either through scrap sharing agreements, in cases in which we are participating in resale programs, or through product pricing, in cases in which we purchase steel directly from steel mills. In either situation, we may be affected by the fluctuation in scrap steel prices, either positively or negatively, in relation to our various customer agreements. As offal prices generally increase and decrease as steel prices increase and decrease, our sale of offal may mitigate the impact of the volatility of steel price increases, as well as limit the benefits reaped from steel price declines. Any volatility in offal and steel prices could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe have a material amount of goodwill, which, if it becomes impaired, would result in a reduction in our net income and equity. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. GAAP requires that goodwill be periodically evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the\nreporting unit. As of December 31, 2014, we had $56.7 million of goodwill that could be subject to impairment. Declines in our profitability or the value of comparable companies may impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a write-down of goodwill and a reduction of net income.\nThe results of our 2014 annual goodwill impairment analysis indicated that the carrying value of the South American reporting unit was more than its fair value. We recorded an impairment charge of $2.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2014 to write-down this goodwill to its fair value of zero.\nDisruptions in the automotive supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Automotive industry conditions could adversely affect the original equipment supply base. The automotive supply chain is subject to disruptions because we, along with our customers and suppliers, attempt to maintain low inventory levels.\nDisruptions could result from a multitude of potential problems, such as the closure of one of our or our suppliers\u2019 plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns, electrical outages, fires, explosions, or political upheaval. Disruptions could also result from logistical complications due to weather, earthquakes, or other natural or nuclear disasters, mechanical failures, technology disruptions, or delayed customs processing.\nIf we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production, the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us. Any disruptions affecting us or caused by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe inability for us, our customers, or our suppliers to obtain and maintain sufficient credit insurance or capital financing, including working capital lines, may adversely affect the liquidity and financial condition of us, our customers, and our suppliers. Our working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending, in part, on the level, variability and timing of our customers\u2019 vehicle production and the payment terms we have with our customers and suppliers. Our liquidity could also be adversely affected if our suppliers were to suspend normal trade credit terms and require payment in advance or payment on delivery. If our available cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our ongoing cash needs, we would be required to look to our cash balances and borrowing availability under our credit facilities to satisfy those needs, as well as look to potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms or in adequate amounts, if at all.\nThere can be no assurance that we, our customers, or our suppliers will continue to have the ability to maintain sufficient capital financing. This may increase the risk of not being able to produce our products or having to pay higher prices for our inputs that may not be recovered in our selling prices. Our suppliers often seek to obtain credit insurance based on our consolidated financial condition and strength, which may be less robust. If we were to experience liquidity issues, our suppliers may not be able to obtain credit insurance and, in turn, would likely not be able to offer us payment terms that we have historically received, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.\nWe may incur costs of a material nature related to plant closings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. If we must close manufacturing locations because of lost business or consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the employee termination costs, asset retirements, and other exit costs associated with the closure of these facilities may be significant. In certain circumstances, we may close a manufacturing facility that is operated under a lease agreement and we may continue to incur material costs in accordance with the lease agreement. We attempt to align production capacity with demand; however, we cannot provide assurance that plants will not have to be closed.\nWe are subject to environmental risks and requirements and we may incur significant costs, liabilities, and obligations associated with those risks and requirements. We are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws, regulations, and permits that govern, among other things, soil, surface water, and groundwater contamination; the generation, storage, handling, use,\ndisposal, and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of materials, including GHGs, into the environment; and health and safety. If we fail to comply with these laws, regulations, or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators or become subject to litigation. Environmental and pollution control laws, regulations, and permits, and the enforcement thereof, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time, and may necessitate substantial capital expenditures or operating costs.\nUnder certain environmental requirements, we could be responsible for costs relating to any contamination at our, or the Predecessor Company\u2019s, currently or formerly owned or operated properties or third-party waste-disposal sites, even if we were not at fault. Soil and groundwater contamination is being addressed at certain of these locations. In addition to potentially significant investigation and cleanup costs, contamination can give rise to third-party claims for fines or penalties, natural resource damages, personal injury, or property damage.\nWe cannot provide assurance that our costs, liabilities, and obligations relating to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Indebtedness We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial health and our ability to fund our operations, obtain financing in the future, and react to changes in our business. As of December 31, 2014, our total debt, including capital lease obligations, was $496.1 million. That indebtedness could:\n\u2022 adversely affect our stock price;\n\u2022 make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our financing arrangements;\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and general industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our borrowings have, and will continue to have, variable interest rates;\n\u2022 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022 place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022 limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to financial and restrictive covenants included in our debt agreements; and\n\u2022 increase our cost of borrowing.\nOur primary debt instrument is the Term Loan Credit Facility which bears interest at (i) the Alternate Base Rate plus a margin of 2.00% or (ii) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (calculated by multiplying the applicable LIBOR rate by a statutory reserve rate, with a floor of 1.00%) plus a margin of 3.00%. As of December 31, 2014, the balance on the term loan was $445 million (net of a $1.6 million discount). If the LIBOR rates increase in excess of 1%, we will incur higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results. While we periodically enter into agreements designed to limit our exposure to higher interest rates, any such agreements do not offer complete protection from this risk.\nWe may not be able to refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to refinance, extend the maturity of, or otherwise amend the terms of our existing indebtedness, or that any refinancing, extension, or amendment will be on commercially reasonable terms. The indebtedness issued in any refinancing of our existing indebtedness could have a significantly higher rate of interest and greater costs than our existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that the financial terms or covenants of any new credit facility or other indebtedness issued to refinance our existing indebtedness will be the same or as favorable as those under our existing indebtedness.\nOur ability to complete a refinancing of our existing indebtedness prior to their respective maturities is subject to a number of conditions beyond our control. For example, if a disruption in the financial markets were to occur at the time that we intended to refinance this indebtedness, we might be restricted in our ability to access the financial markets. Also, if we were unable to make payments or refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we would have to consider other options, such as:\n\u2022 sales of assets;\n\u2022 sales of equity; or\n\u2022 negotiations with lenders and their respective agents to restructure the applicable debt.\nOur debt instruments may restrict, and market or business conditions may limit, our ability to employ some of our options.\nIn addition, under our credit agreements, a change in control may lead the lenders to exercise remedies such as acceleration of the loan, termination of their obligations to fund additional advances and collection against the collateral securing such loan.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under such indebtedness, which may not be successful. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations, certain of which have short-term maturities, depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions, as well as financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. We cannot provide assurance that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay or refinance our indebtedness.\nOur debt instruments restrict our current and future operations. The financing agreements governing our indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022 incur or guarantee additional debt, incur liens, or issue certain equity;\n\u2022 declare or make distributions to our stockholders, repurchase equity, or prepay certain debt;\n\u2022 make loans or certain investments;\n\u2022 make certain acquisitions of equity or assets;\n\u2022 enter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 enter into mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations;\n\u2022 consolidate, transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of certain assets;\n\u2022 use the proceeds from sales of assets and stock;\n\u2022 enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022 enter into restrictive agreements;\n\u2022 make capital expenditures;\n\u2022 change our fiscal year;\n\u2022 amend or modify organizational documents; and\n\u2022 engage in businesses other than the businesses we currently conduct.\nIn addition to the restrictions and covenants listed above, certain of our financing documents require us, under certain circumstances, to comply with specified financial maintenance covenants. Any of these restrictions or covenants could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet certain capital needs and could otherwise restrict our corporate activities.\nSubstantially all of our subsidiaries\u2019 assets are pledged as collateral under our secured financing arrangements. As of December 31, 2014, we had $487.2 million (net of $1.6 million original issue discount associated with the Term Loan Credit Facility) of secured debt, excluding capital leases. Substantially all of our subsidiaries\u2019 assets are pledged as collateral for our borrowings under our secured financing arrangements. Most of our domestic subsidiaries are either primary obligors or guarantors under a secured financing arrangement. Substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries\u2019 assets are pledged as collateral for these obligations. If we are unable to repay all secured borrowings when due, whether at maturity or if declared due and payable following a default, the agent or the lenders, as applicable, would have the right to proceed against the collateral pledged to secure the indebtedness and may sell the assets pledged as collateral in order to repay those borrowings, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock may be volatile. The price at which our common stock trades may be volatile due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition or annual or quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022 changes in investors\u2019 or financial analysts\u2019 perception of our business risks or condition of our business;\n\u2022 changes in, or our failure to meet, earnings estimates or other performance expectations of investors or financial analysts;\n\u2022 unfavorable commentary or downgrades of our stock by equity research analysts;\n\u2022 our success or failure in implementing our growth plans;\n\u2022 changes in the market valuations of companies viewed as similar to us;\n\u2022 changes or proposed changes in governmental regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022 changes in key personnel;\n\u2022 volume of our common stock trading in the market;\n\u2022 failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022 future sales of our common stock; and\n\u2022 the granting or exercise of employee stock options or other equity awards.\nBroad market fluctuations may result in a material decline in the market price of our common stock and you may not be able to sell your shares at prices you deem acceptable. In the past, following periods of volatility in the equity markets, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against public companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial cost and the diversion of management attention.\nShares eligible for future sale may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, even if our business is doing well. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 350,000,000 shares of common stock and as of February 24, 2015 we had 21,033,856 shares of common stock outstanding.", "PERMNO": 12340, "SIC": 3711, "TIC": "TOWR"}
