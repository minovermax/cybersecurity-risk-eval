RISK FACTORS\nBusiness Risks\nOur strategy may not be successful.\nOur strategy has three pillars: accelerate profitable growth, deliver operational excellence and introduce digital solutions. We may not be successful in growing revenue in high-margin lines of business, increasing our market share with existing customers or winning new business with smaller financial institutions and the retail market. We also may not be successful in strengthening and leveraging our IT capabilities to introduce digital solutions. If we are unable to achieve our strategic objectives and anticipated operating profit improvements, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries.\nWe compete in industries that are subject to significant competition and pricing pressures in most markets. In addition, our business model requires significant fixed costs associated with offering many of our services including costs to operate a fleet of armored vehicles and a network of secure branches. Because we believe we have competitive advantages such as brand name recognition and a reputation for a high level of service and security, we resist competing on price alone. However, continued pricing pressure from competitors, failure to achieve pricing based on the competitive advantages identified above and/or inability to offset inflationary cost increases through price increases could result in lost volume of business and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, given the highly competitive nature of our industries, it is important to develop new solutions and product and service offerings to help retain and expand our customer base. Failure to develop, sell and execute new solutions and offerings in a timely and efficient manner could also negatively affect our ability to retain our existing customer base or pricing structure and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDecreased use of cash could have a negative impact on our business.\nWhile cash remains one of the most popular form of consumer payment in the U.S. and globally, the growth of payment options other than cash could reduce the need for services related to cash, thereby affecting our financial results. We are developing new services that offer current and prospective customers with opportunities to streamline their cash processing costs, making cash more competitive with other forms of payment. There is a risk that these initiatives may not offset the risks associated with our traditional cash-based business and that our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nWe may not be successful in pursuing strategic investments or acquisitions or realize the expected benefits of those transactions because of integration difficulties and other challenges.\nWhile we may identify opportunities for acquisitions and investments to support our growth strategy, our due diligence examinations and positions that we may take with respect to appropriate valuations for acquisitions and divestitures and other transaction terms and conditions may hinder our ability to successfully complete business transactions to achieve our strategic goals. We compete with others within and outside our industry for suitable acquisition candidates. This competition may increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of acquisition candidates available to us. As a result, our ability to acquire businesses in the future, and to acquire such businesses on favorable terms, may be limited. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions will depend, in part, on successfully integrating each business with our company as well as improving operating performance and profitability through our management efforts and capital investments. The risks to a successful integration and improvement of operating performance and profitability include, among others, failure to implement our business plan, unanticipated issues in integrating operations with ours, unanticipated changes in laws and regulations, labor unrest resulting from union operations, regulatory, environmental and permitting issues, unfavorable customer reactions, the effect on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and difficulties in fully identifying and evaluating potential liabilities, risks and operating issues. In order to finance such acquisitions, we may need to obtain additional funds either through public or private financings, including bank and other secured and unsecured borrowings and the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that such financings would be available to us on reasonable terms or that any future issuances of securities in connection with acquisitions will not be dilutive to our shareholders. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our expected benefits of any acquisitions and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations, the extent of which depends on many factors that are uncertain or not yet identifiable.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to create volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption for Brink\u2019s, our customers and vendors, and the markets in which we do business. Since 2020, our operational performance and economic activity in the countries in which we operate have been significantly impacted by pandemic-related health conditions and the associated government, customer and consumer actions. These actions have led to reduced customer volumes, changes to our operating procedures and increases to our costs to provide services. We have taken and continue to take actions to adjust the way we operate and reduce our costs through restructuring activities and operational changes to address these impacts and align to future anticipated revenue levels. We are continually assessing the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic, and the actions taken in response to it, will have on our employees, businesses and segments, customers and vendors and the industries that we serve. While the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been assessed, the long-term magnitude and\nduration of the disruption remains uncertain. We expect these factors will continue to impact our financial condition and our results of operations for a duration that is currently unknown.\nThe factors that have affected us and may continue to affect us could include, among other things, (i) the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the types and magnitude of adverse impacts on regional economies, individually, and the global economy, as a whole; (ii) the emergence and spread of new variants of the virus; (iii) the health and welfare of our employees and that of our customers, vendors and suppliers; (iv) business and government actions in response to the pandemic, including moratoriums by governments and regulators on rule making and regulatory and legal proceedings, limitations on employee actions by regulators and unions, and stay at home, social distancing measures and travel bans; (v) the impact on the development and implementation of strategic initiatives and the integration of acquired businesses, including those acquired from G4S; (vi) the response of our customers or prospective customers to the pandemic, including suspensions or terminations of existing contracts; (vii) the varying demand for the types of services we offer in the countries in which we offer them; (viii) our ability to continue to effectively market our services; (ix) our ability to resume services as needed; (x) the type, size, profitability and geographic locations of our operations; (xi) the ability of our customers to pay, to make timely payments or to pay in full; (xii) labor shortages; and (xii) the development and availability of effective vaccines or treatment, the speed at which vaccines are administered, the efficacy of vaccines against the virus and evolving strains or variants of the virus. Any of these events, and others we have not yet identified, could cause or contribute to the risks and uncertainties facing the Company and our customers and could materially adversely affect our business or portions thereof, and our financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact the health and welfare of our employees, including our executive officers, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers and our results of operations.\nOur customer-facing employees are necessary to conduct many of our services. If the health and welfare of customer-facing employees or employees providing critical corporate functions (including our executive officers) deteriorates, the number of employees so afflicted becomes significant, or an employee with skills and knowledge that cannot be replicated in our organization is impaired due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to win business and provide services, as well as employee morale, customer relationships, business prospects, and results of operations of one or more of our segments, or the Company as a whole, could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have certain environmental and other exposures related to our former coal operations.\nWe may incur future environmental and other liabilities in connection with our former coal operations, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.\nGrowing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations to which we are subject. Some form of federal regulation may be forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide) and/or \"cap and trade\" legislation. The outcome of this legislation may result in new regulation, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities or other regulatory actions. Compliance with these actions could result in the creation of additional costs to us, including, among other things, increased fuel prices or additional taxes or emission allowances. We may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations from our customers, which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, the potential effects of climate change and related regulation on our customers are highly uncertain and may adversely affect our operations.\nOperational Risks\nWe have significant operations outside the United States.\nWe currently serve customers in more than 100 countries, including 53 countries where we operate subsidiaries. Seventy percent (70%) of our revenues in 2021 came from operations outside the U.S. We expect revenues outside the U.S. to continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues. Business operations outside the U.S. are subject to political, economic and other risks inherent in operating in foreign countries, such as:\n\u2022the difficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets through foreign legal systems;\n\u2022trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\n\u2022required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022enforcement of our global compliance program in foreign countries with a variety of laws, cultures and customs;\n\u2022varying permitting and licensing requirements in different jurisdictions;\n\u2022foreign ownership laws;\n\u2022changes in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets;\n\u2022threat of nationalization and expropriation;\n\u2022higher costs and risks of doing business in a number of foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022laws or other requirements and restrictions associated with organized labor;\n\u2022limitations on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022fluctuations in equity, revenues and profits due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including measures taken by governments to devalue official currency exchange rates;\n\u2022inflation levels exceeding that of the U.S; and\n\u2022inability to collect for services provided to government entities.\nWe are exposed to certain risks when we operate in countries that have high levels of inflation, including the risk that:\n\u2022the rate of price increases for services will not keep pace with the cost of inflation;\n\u2022adverse economic conditions may discourage business growth which could affect demand for our services;\n\u2022the devaluation of the currency may exceed the rate of inflation and reported U.S. dollar revenues and profits may decline; and\n\u2022these countries may be deemed \u201chighly inflationary\u201d for U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) purposes.\nWe manage these risks by monitoring current and anticipated political and economic developments, monitoring adherence to our global compliance program and adjusting operations as appropriate. Changes in the political or economic environments of the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in regulated industries.\nOur U.S. operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation with respect to safety of operations and equipment and financial responsibility. Intrastate operations in the U.S. are subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities and interprovincial operations in Canada are subject to regulation by Canadian and provincial regulatory authorities. Our other international operations are regulated to varying degrees by the countries in which we operate. Many countries have permit requirements for security services and prohibit foreign companies from providing different types of security services.\nAdditionally, Brink\u2019s Capital LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, is federally registered as a \u201cMoney Services Business\u201d with the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and may in the future be registered and/or licensed as a \u201cmoney transmitter\u201d or similar designation with various other state or local jurisdictions in the U.S. related to delivering future products and services. Federal registrations subject us to, among other things, having an effective anti-money laundering (AML) compliance program, record-keeping requirements and reporting requirements , and examination by state and federal regulatory agencies, and these and our other regulatory obligations may significantly increase our costs or impact our operations.\nChanges in laws or regulations could require a change in the way we operate, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses. If laws and regulations were to change or we failed to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to achieve, or may be delayed in achieving, our initiatives to drive efficiency and control costs.\nWe have launched a number of initiatives to improve efficiencies and reduce operating costs. Although we have achieved annual cost savings associated with these initiatives, we may be unable to sustain the cost savings that we have achieved. In addition, if we are unable to achieve, or have any unexpected delays in achieving additional cost savings, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. Even if we meet our goals as a result of these initiatives, we may not receive the expected financial benefits of these initiatives.\nLabor shortages and increased labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nLabor costs in the United States are rising, and our industry is experiencing a shortage of workers. Labor is our largest operating cost. If we face labor shortages and increased labor costs as a result of increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover rates, or other employee benefits costs, our operating expenses could increase and our growth and results of operations could be adversely impacted. We may be unable to increase prices in order to pass future increased labor costs onto our customers, in which case our margins would be negatively affected. Additionally, if product prices are increased by us to cover increased labor costs, the higher prices could adversely affect sales volumes.\nFinancial Risks\nWe have significant retirement obligations. Poor investment performance of retirement plan holdings and/or lower interest rates used to discount the obligations could unfavorably affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nWe have substantial pension and retiree medical obligations, a portion of which have been funded. The amount of these obligations is significantly affected by factors that are not in our control, including interest rates used to determine the present value of future payment streams, investment returns, medical inflation rates, participation rates and changes in laws and regulations. The funded status of the primary U.S. pension plan was approximately 92% as of December 31, 2021. Based on our actuarial assumptions at the end of 2021, no cash payments to the plan are needed in the foreseeable future. A change in assumptions could result in funding obligations that could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to use our resources to make acquisitions and to otherwise grow our business.\nWe have $524 million of actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at the end of 2021. These losses relate to changes in actuarial assumptions that have increased the net liability for benefit plans. These losses have not been recognized in earnings. These losses will be recognized in earnings in future periods to the extent they are not offset by future actuarial gains. Our\nprojections of future cash requirements and expenses for these plans could be adversely affected if our retirement plans have additional actuarial losses.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets in the United States that may not be realized.\nDeferred tax assets are future tax deductions that result primarily from the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. At December 31, 2021, we had $176 million of U.S. deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, primarily related to our retirement plan obligations. These future tax deductions may not be realized if tax rules change in the future, or if forecasted U.S. operational results or any other U.S. projected future taxable income is insufficient. Consequently, not realizing our U.S. deferred tax assets may significantly and materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur effective income tax rate could change.\nWe operate subsidiaries in 53 countries, all of which have different income tax laws and associated income tax rates. Our effective income tax rate can be significantly affected by changes in the mix of pretax earnings by country and the related income tax rates in those countries. In addition, our effective income tax rate is significantly affected by the ability to realize deferred tax assets, including those associated with net operating losses. Changes in income tax laws, income apportionment, or estimates of the ability to realize deferred tax assets, could significantly affect our effective income tax rate, financial position and results of operations. We are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIt is possible that we will incur restructuring charges in the future.\nIt is possible that we will take restructuring actions, including in connection with acquisitions, in one or more of our markets in the future to reduce expenses. These actions could result in significant restructuring charges at these subsidiaries, including recognizing impairment charges to write down assets and recording accruals for employee severance. These charges, if required, could significantly and materially affect results of operations and cash flows.\nOur inability to access capital or significant increases in our cost of capital could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to obtain adequate and cost-effective financing depends on our credit quality as well as the liquidity of financial markets. A negative change in our ratings outlook or any downgrade in our credit ratings by the rating agencies could adversely affect our cost and/or access to sources of liquidity and capital. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to access short-term and long-term capital. Our access to funds under current credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the participating banks to meet their funding commitments. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity. Longer disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to capital needed for our business.\nWe are subject to covenants for our credit facilities and our unsecured notes.\nOur senior secured credit facility, senior unsecured notes, letter of credit facilities and bank guarantee facilities contain various financial and other covenants. The financial covenants include a limit on the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and a limit on the ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest expense. Other covenants, among other things, limit our ability to provide liens, restrict fundamental changes, limit transactions with affiliates and unrestricted subsidiaries, restrict changes to our fiscal year and to organization documents, limit asset dispositions, limit the use of proceeds from asset sales, limit sale and leaseback transactions, limit investments, limit the ability to incur debt, restrict certain payments to shareholders, limit negative pledges and limit the ability to change the nature of our business. Although we believe none of these covenants are presently restrictive to operations, the ability to meet financial and other covenants can be affected by changes in our results of operations or financial condition. We cannot provide assurance that we will meet these covenants. A breach of these covenants could result in a default under existing credit facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities, the lenders could cause amounts outstanding to be immediately payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. The occurrence of these events would have a significant effect on our liquidity and cash flows.\nOur earnings and cash flow could be materially affected by increased losses of customer valuables.\nWe purchase insurance coverage for losses of customer valuables for amounts in excess of what we consider prudent deductibles and/or retentions. Insurance is provided by different groups of underwriters at negotiated rates and terms. Coverage is available to us in major insurance markets, although premiums charged are subject to fluctuations depending on market conditions. Our loss experience and that of other companies in our industry affects premium rates. We are not insured for losses below our coverage limits and recognize expense up to these limits for actual losses. Our insurance policies cover losses from most causes, with the exception of war, nuclear risk and various other exclusions typical for such policies. The availability of high-quality and reliable insurance coverage is an important factor in obtaining and retaining customers and managing the risks of our business. If our losses increase, or if we are unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nInformation Technology Risks\nRisks associated with information technology can expose Brink\u2019s to business disruptions, cybersecurity breaches and regulatory violations.\nWe rely on our information technology (\"IT\") infrastructure. If there were to be significant problems with our infrastructure, such as IT datacenter or system failure, or failure to develop new technology platforms to support new initiatives and product and service offerings, it could halt or delay our ability to service our customers, hinder our ability to conduct and expand our business and require significant remediation costs. Our data security risks will increase as we expand services and employ emerging technologies, mobile applications, third-party service providers and cloud-based services. Hacking, phishing attacks, ransomware, insider threats, physical breaches or other actions may cause confidential information belonging to Brink\u2019s, its employees or customers to be misused. If any of these risks were to materialize in a system, application or data center that houses sensitive and confidential data, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information and business sensitive information, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, if these risks were materialize, we may incur significant challenges and costs related to coordination with third-party service providers in order to resolve related issues.\nIf our third-party providers do not respond in a timely manner to our needs, disaster recovery, business continuity and crisis management activities could be negatively impacted. We have programs in place that are intended to detect, contain and respond to cybersecurity breaches and that provide employee awareness training regarding cyber risks; however, due to evolving and advanced sophisticated attack vectors, cyber attacks remain increasingly difficult to detect and we may not be able to successfully defend against them. Any significant cybersecurity incident, involving Brink's or by third-party service providers, could damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a global company we must adhere to applicable laws and regulations in numerous regions regarding data privacy, data protection, and data security. Privacy and data protection laws vary between countries and are subject to interpretation, which may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. The European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of European Union law and became effective in May 2018. GDPR and other privacy and data protection laws impose requirements related to the handling of personal data, mandates public disclosure of certain data breaches, and provides for substantial penalties for non-compliance. Our efforts to comply with GDPR and other privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time, and we could incur substantial penalties or be subject to litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Securities\nWe cannot guarantee that we will repurchase our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program or that our share repurchase program will enhance long-term shareholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves.\nOn October 27, 2021, the Board authorized a new share repurchase program. Under the new program, we are authorized to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed $250 million, excluding fees, commissions and other ancillary expenses. The new authorization replaced the prior $250 million program, which was fully utilized.\nAlthough the Board has authorized the share repurchase program, the share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities. A potential tax on share repurchases that would make share repurchases more expensive, may also impact our decision to engage in share repurchases. Also, our ability to repurchase shares of stock may be limited by restrictive covenants in our debt agreements and indentures in our Senior Notes. The repurchase program may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. In addition, repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.\nGeneral Risks\nThe Company could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist or hostile stockholders.\nShareholder activism, which could take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing among publicly traded companies. Shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, requires significant time and attention by management and the Board, potentially hindering the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategic plan and negatively affecting the trading value of our common stock. Additionally,\nshareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to the Company\u2019s future direction, adversely affect its relationships with key executives, customers and other business partners, or make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, the Company has been, and may in the future be, required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters. Any of these impacts could materially and adversely affect the Company and operating results.\nNegative publicity to our name or brand could lead to a loss of revenues or profitability.\nWe are in the payments and security business and our success and longevity are based to a large extent on our reputation for trust and integrity. Our reputation or brand, particularly the trust placed in us by our customers, could be negatively impacted in the event of perceived or actual breaches in our ability to conduct our business ethically, securely and responsibly. In addition, we have licensing arrangements that permit certain entities to use Brink\u2019s name and/or other intellectual property in connection with their businesses. If any of these entities experienced an actual or perceived breach in its ability to conduct its business ethically, securely or responsibly, it could have a negative effect on our name and/or brand. Any damage to our brand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business success depends on retaining our leadership team and attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nOur future success depends, in part, on the continuing services and contributions of our leadership team to execute on our strategic plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities. Our future success also depends, in part, on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. Any turnover in senior management or inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a negative effect on our results of operations. Turnover in key leadership positions within the Company may adversely affect our ability to manage the company efficiently and effectively, could be disruptive and distracting to management and may lead to additional departures of current personnel, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis document contains both historical and forward-looking information.
