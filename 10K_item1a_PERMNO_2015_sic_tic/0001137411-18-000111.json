While in 2018 the U.S. Congress acted to increase defense funding for the government's fiscal 2018 and 2019 budget periods, U.S. defense funding is expected to continue to be under pressure due to the overall economic environment, budget deficits and competing budget priorities. Cost cutting, efficiency initiatives, reprioritization and other affordability analysis by the U.S. Government on defense spending could present opportunities for us, but continued pressure on U.S. Government spending on defense could also adversely impact our Government Systems sales and profitability.\nThe U.S. Government has implemented various initiatives to address its fiscal challenges. In August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011 which imposed spending caps and certain reductions in defense spending over a ten-year period through 2021. These spending caps and reductions, referred to as sequestration, went into effect in March 2013. Through a series of bipartisan agreements, Congress has been able to temporarily lift discretionary spending limits every year through 2019. However, unless a new agreement is enacted, the BCA will again be in force beginning in 2020. The continued uncertainty surrounding the U.S. defense budget could have a material adverse effect on the Company and the defense industry in general.\nIn years when the U.S. Government does not complete its annual budget and appropriations process prior to the beginning of its fiscal year (October 1), government operations are typically funded through a continuing resolution that authorizes agencies of the U.S. Government to continue to operate in the new year, but generally does not authorize new spending initiatives. During periods covered by a continuing resolution (or until the regular appropriation bills are passed), we may experience delays by the government in the procurement of new or existing products and services which can adversely impact our results of operations and cause variability in the timing of revenue between periods. During 2018, the U.S. Government completed the fiscal year 2019 Defense budget authorization and approval timeline on schedule and thus avoided the need for a continuing resolution for this part of government operations. Should the U.S. Government not complete fiscal year 2020 budgeting and appropriations in the same manner, we expect to be exposed to the effects of a continuing resolution in the future.\nWe offer a diverse range of defense products and services. We believe that this makes it less likely that cuts in any specific contract or program will have a long-term effect on our business; however, delays or termination of multiple or large programs or contracts could adversely affect our business and future financial performance. Potential changes in funding priorities may afford new or additional opportunities for our businesses in terms of existing, follow-on or replacement programs. While we would expect to compete and be well positioned as the incumbent on existing programs, we may not be successful, and any replacement programs may be funded at lower levels.\nWe depend to a significant degree on U.S. Government contracts, which are subject to unique risks.\nIn addition to normal business risks, our supply of systems and products to the U.S. Government is subject to unique risks which are largely beyond our control. These risks include:\n\u2022\ndependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds\n\u2022\nthe ability of the U.S. Government to terminate, without prior notice, partially completed government programs and contracts that were previously authorized (although we may recover certain costs if terminated for convenience)\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies which may reflect military and political developments, including U.S. Government initiatives to gain increased access to intellectual property\n\u2022\nsignificant changes in contract scheduling or program structure, which generally result in delays or reductions in deliveries or timing of cash receipts\n\u2022\nintense competition for available U.S. Government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development\n\u2022\ndifficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work\n\u2022\nchanges over the life of U.S. Government contracts, particularly development contracts, which generally result in adjustments of contract prices\n\u2022\nclaims based on U.S. Government work and violation of associated compliance and other requirements, which may result in fines, the cancellation or suspension of payments or suspension or debarment proceedings affecting potential further business with the U.S. Government\nWe are subject to risks arising from changes in the competitive environment in which we operate.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Many of our competitors are also our suppliers or customers on our programs and may be significantly larger than us. Among others, risks in the competitive environment include:\n\u2022\nincreased competition resulting from industry consolidation and original equipment manufacturers' efforts to vertically integrate\n\u2022\ncustomers seeking more rights in intellectual property developed in connection with their program, price concessions, extensive liability protections and other customer favorable contract terms\n\u2022\ncompetitors offering lower prices and new solutions, developing new technologies or otherwise capturing more market share\nInternational conflicts and terrorism may adversely affect our business.\nConflicts and political turmoil in certain regions outside the United States and the possibility of future terrorist attacks cause significant uncertainty with respect to business and financial markets and may adversely affect our business. These international conflicts also affect the price of oil, which has a significant impact on the financial health of our commercial customers. Although our Government Systems business may experience greater demand for its products as a result of increased government defense spending, factors arising (directly or indirectly) from international conflicts or terrorism which may adversely affect our commercial business include reduced aircraft build rates, upgrades, maintenance and spending on discretionary products, as well as increases in the cost of property and aviation products insurance and increased restrictions placed on our insurance policies.\nOur business is heavily concentrated in the aviation industry.\nAs a provider of products and services to the aviation industry, we are significantly affected by the overall economic condition of that industry. The aviation industry is historically cyclical.\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted, among other things, by the following:\n\u2022\nreductions in demand for aircraft and delayed aircraft delivery schedules\n\u2022\nincreased vertical integration efforts of the original equipment manufacturers of aircraft\n\u2022\nbankruptcy or other significant financial difficulties of our existing and potential customers\n\u2022\nreductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support\n\u2022\ndeferral of discretionary spending by our airline customers for cabin retrofit activities\n\u2022\nretirement or storage of older generation aircraft, resulting in fewer retrofits and less demand for services for those aircraft, as well as the increased availability of used or recycled equipment on the market\n\u2022\nlimited availability of financing for airlines or aircraft\n\u2022\nimpact on the aviation industry due to the volatility of fuel prices\n\u2022\ndisruptions to commercial air travel demand\nA global or regional recession may adversely affect us.\nIf a recession emerges that impacts where we do business, risks may include:\n\u2022\ndeclines in revenues, profitability and cash flows from reduced orders, payment delays or other factors caused by the economic problems of our customers\n\u2022\nadverse impacts on our access to short-term commercial paper borrowings or other credit sources\n\u2022\nsupply problems associated with any financial constraints faced by our suppliers\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from international sales and are subject to the risks of doing business outside the U.S.\nIn 2018, 48 percent of our total revenues were from sales of our products and services internationally, including foreign military sales. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total sales. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022\nlaws, regulations and policies of non-U.S. governments relating to investments and operations, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad\n\u2022\nthe imposition of tariffs or embargoes, export controls and other trade restrictions, including the recent tariffs imposed by the U.S. and China and the possibility of additional tariffs or other trade restrictions relating to trade between the two countries\n\u2022\nregulatory requirements and potential changes, including anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, antitrust and data privacy requirements\n\u2022\nchanges in government spending on defense programs\n\u2022\nuncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding, credit or guarantees\n\u2022\nrequirements of certain customers which obligate us to specified levels of in-country purchases, manufacturing or investments, known as offsets, and penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements\n\u2022\nimpacts associated with foreign currency volatility\n\u2022\nuncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights\n\u2022\nrapid changes in government, economic and political policies, political or civil unrest or the threat of international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation\nWe have made, and expect to continue to make, strategic acquisitions and partnerships that involve risks and uncertainties.\nWe completed two acquisitions in the past two fiscal years. We will consider making minor acquisitions and partnerships in the future in an effort to enhance shareowner value. Acquisitions and partnerships involve certain risks and uncertainties, such as:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in integrating newly-acquired businesses and commencing partnership operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner and the risk that we encounter significant unanticipated costs or other problems associated with integration or commencement\n\u2022\nchallenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost and revenue synergies and other expected benefits\n\u2022\nrisk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and the targeted technologies do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets\n\u2022\nrisk that we assume significant liabilities that exceed the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of any indemnifying parties\n\u2022\nloss of key employees of the acquired businesses or joint venture\n\u2022\nrisk of diverting the attention of senior management from our existing operations\n\u2022\nrisk of litigation associated with an acquisition\nWe enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns.\nDuring 2018, approximately 94 percent of our total sales were, and a significant portion of our anticipated future sales will be, from fixed-price contracts. This allows us to benefit from cost savings, but it carries the burden of potential cost overruns since we assume all of the cost risk. If our initial cost estimates are incorrect, we can incur losses on these contracts. These fixed-price contracts can expose us to potentially large losses because the customer may compel us to complete a project or, in the event of a termination for default, pay the entire incremental cost of its replacement by another provider regardless of the size of any cost overruns that occur over the life of the contract. Because many of these projects involve new technologies and applications and can last for years, unforeseen events such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw\nmaterials (including added tariffs), problems with subcontractors and cost overruns can result in the contractual price becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us over time. Furthermore, if we do not meet project deadlines or specifications, we may need to renegotiate contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer exercises its right to terminate. In addition, some of our contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights, and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts we may not realize their full benefits. Our results of operations are dependent on our ability to maximize earnings from our contracts. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks in our integration processes and production systems, including potential issues in meeting stringent performance and reliability standards.\nThe aerospace and defense business is complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and customers, highly-skilled labor, stringent regulatory and contractual requirements and performance and reliability standards. As a result, our ability to deliver products and systems on time, satisfy regulatory and customer requirements, and achieve or maintain program profitability is subject to significant risk. Operational delays or defects could result in increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries and disruption to our customers.\nTax changes could affect our effective tax rate and future profitability.\nOur future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in our overall profitability and changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax legislation, the results of audits and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessment of our tax exposures. For example, in 2018 the U.S. Government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act), which contains significant changes to the U.S. tax system. We are analyzing the Act to determine the full impact of the new tax law, and to the extent any future guidance differs from our preliminary interpretation of the law, it could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe depend on critical suppliers and subcontractors.\nWe do not always have alternate sources of supply readily available for certain goods or services, such as liquid crystal displays. A shortage of raw materials or components, the loss of a significant supplier or subcontractor or their inability to meet performance, quality or delivery requirements due to natural disaster, financial stress, capacity constraints, military conflicts or other causes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on specialized test equipment.\nSome of our specialized test equipment that supports the reliability of our products and systems is the result of significant investment. Back-up test equipment may not be readily available. Damage to our specialized test equipment may result in protracted production recovery and may adversely impact our ability to service our products.\nA cybersecurity incident, network failure, data privacy breach or other business disruption could have negative impacts.\nWe face cyber threats, threats to the physical security of our facilities, potential cyber attacks to the integrity of our networks and/or products, and the potential release or theft of our intellectual property or other important data as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology (IT) failures. Possible areas of significant exposure to cyber threats or other disruptions include our enterprise information technology resources, our information management network that provides communication services to customers and our flight deck communication products and solutions. Any of these threats or disruptions may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Risks may include:\n\u2022\nadverse effects to future results due to the theft, destruction, loss, corruption or release of personal data, confidential information or intellectual property\n\u2022\noperational or business disruptions resulting from the failure of IT or other systems and subsequent mitigation activities\n\u2022\nfines, penalties or negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers, suppliers, employees, shareowners and others\nRisks Related to Our B/E Aerospace Transaction:\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate B/E Aerospace's business and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nThe success of the merger will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine our business with B/E Aerospace's business and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies, from the combination. If we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe merger involves the integration of B/E Aerospace's business with our existing business, which is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. We have not previously completed a transaction comparable in size or scope to the merger. The integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the devotion of management's attention to the integration\n\u2022\nmaintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees\n\u2022\nthe possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations\n\u2022\nretaining existing business and operational relationships and attracting new business and operational relationships\n\u2022\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically separate organizations\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems\n\u2022\nunforeseen expenses or delays associated with the integration\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy, which could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to the Pending Acquisition of the Company by UTC:\nThe UTC Merger is subject to conditions, some or all of which may not be satisfied, or completed on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to complete the UTC Merger could have material adverse effects on us.\nThe completion of the UTC Merger is subject to a number of conditions. On November 23, 2018, UTC announced that the final regulatory approval required to close its acquisition of Rockwell Collins had been received and that the acquisition was expected to close within three business days.\nThe failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the UTC Merger or prevent it from occurring at all. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the UTC Merger will be satisfied or waived or that the UTC Merger will be completed. Also, subject to limited exceptions, either we or UTC may terminate the Merger Agreement if the UTC Merger has not been completed by 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on March 4, 2019.\nIf the UTC Merger is not completed, our ongoing business may be materially adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the UTC Merger, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe market price of our common stock could decline\n\u2022\nwe could owe a $695 million termination fee to UTC under certain circumstances, including a material breach by us\n\u2022\ntime and resources, financial and other, committed by our management to integration planning or other matters relating to the UTC Merger could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from our customers, suppliers or employees\n\u2022\nwe will be required to pay our costs relating to the UTC Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory and printing fees, whether or not the UTC Merger is completed\nIn addition, if the UTC Merger is not completed, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the UTC Merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the UTC Merger Agreement. Any of these risks could materially and adversely impact our ongoing business, financial condition, financial results and stock price.\nSimilarly, delays in the completion of the UTC Merger could, among other things, result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the UTC Merger and could materially and adversely affect our ongoing business, financial condition, financial results and stock price.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit our ability to pursue alternatives to the UTC Merger, could discourage a potential competing acquiror of the Company from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal and, in specified circumstances, could require us to pay a substantial termination fee to UTC.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for us to be acquired by any company other than UTC. The Merger Agreement contains certain provisions that restrict our ability to, among other things, initiate, seek, solicit, knowingly facilitate, knowingly encourage, knowingly induce or knowingly take any other action reasonably expected to lead to, or engage in negotiations or discussions relating to, or approve or recommend, any third-party acquisition proposal.\nIn some circumstances, including a material breach by us, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $695 million to UTC.\nThese provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquiror or merger partner that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of us or pursuing an alternative transaction from considering or proposing such a transaction, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share value than the value proposed to be received in the UTC Merger. In particular, the termination fee, if applicable, would be substantial, and could result in a potential third-party acquiror or merger partner proposing to pay a lower price to our shareowners than it might otherwise have proposed to pay absent such a fee.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated and we determine to seek another business combination, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the UTC Merger.\nThe value of the stock portion of the Merger Consideration is subject to changes based on fluctuations in the value of UTC common stock.\nUpon completion of the UTC Merger, each issued and outstanding share of Rockwell Collins common stock (other than certain excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, which is equal to $93.33 in cash, without interest, plus a fraction of a share of UTC common stock having a value equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $46.67 by the average of the volume-weighted average prices per share of UTC common stock on the NYSE on each of the 20 consecutive trading days ending with the trading day immediately prior to the closing date, subject to adjustment based on a two-way collar mechanism as described below. If the UTC stock price is greater than $107.01 but less than $124.37, the exchange ratio will be equal to the quotient of (1) $46.67 divided by (2) the UTC stock price. However, if the UTC stock price is less than or equal to $107.01 or greater than or equal to $124.37, then a two-way collar mechanism will apply, pursuant to which (a) if the UTC stock price is greater than or equal to $124.37, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.37525 and result in more than $46.67 in value, and (b) if the UTC stock price is less than or equal to $107.01, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.43613 and result in less than $46.67 in value. Accordingly, the actual number of shares and the value of UTC common stock\ndelivered to our shareowners will depend on the UTC stock price, and the value of the shares of UTC common stock delivered for each such share of our common stock may be greater than, less than or equal to $46.67. On November 23, 2018, UTC announced that the final regulatory approval required to close its acquisition of Rockwell Collins had been received and that the acquisition was expected to close within three business days.\nWe are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the UTC Merger is pending, which could adversely affect our business and operations.\nIn connection with the pendency of the UTC Merger, it is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the UTC Merger, which could negatively affect our revenues, earnings and/or cash flows, as well as the market price of our common stock, regardless of whether the UTC Merger is completed.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completing the UTC Merger which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies, including the ability in certain cases to enter into or amend contracts, acquire or dispose of assets, incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures. Such limitations could adversely affect our business and operations prior to the completion of the UTC Merger. Each of the risks described above may be exacerbated by delays or other adverse developments with respect to the completion of the UTC Merger.\nCompletion of the UTC Merger will trigger change in control or other provisions in certain customer and other agreements to which we are a party, which may have an adverse impact on our or UTC\u2019s business and results of operations following completion of the UTC Merger.\nThe completion of the UTC Merger will trigger change in control and other provisions in certain customer and other agreements to which we are a party. If we or UTC are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, customers or other counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages or equitable remedies. Even if we and UTC are able to negotiate consents or waivers, the customers or other counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to us or the combined company. Certain of our customers have commented on the potential impact of the UTC Merger, including potential benefits, questions and concerns. Any of the foregoing or similar developments may have an adverse impact on our or UTC\u2019s business and results of operations following completion of the UTC Merger.\nUncertainties associated with the UTC Merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees, which could adversely affect our future business and operations.\nWe are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute their business plans. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to retain certain key management personnel and employees. Prior to completion of the UTC Merger, current and prospective employees of us and UTC may experience uncertainty about their roles within UTC following the completion of the UTC Merger, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract or retain key management and other key personnel. In addition, no assurance can be given that UTC, after the completion of the UTC Merger, will be able to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees to the same extent that we and UTC have previously been able to attract or retain their own employees.\nThe UTC common stock to be received by our shareowners upon completion of the UTC Merger will have different rights from shares of Rockwell Collins common stock.\nUpon completion of the UTC Merger, our shareowners will no longer be shareowners of Rockwell Collins, but will instead become shareowners of UTC and their rights as UTC shareowners will be governed by the terms of UTC\u2019s certificate of incorporation and by-laws. The terms of UTC\u2019s certificate of incorporation and by-laws are in some respects materially different than the terms of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, which currently govern the rights of our shareowners.\nCautionary Statement\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, and documents that are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains statements, including statements regarding certain projections, business trends and the proposed acquisition of Rockwell Collins by UTC, that are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
