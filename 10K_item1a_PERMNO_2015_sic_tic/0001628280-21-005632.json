RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, growth prospects, and the trading price of our common stock.\nRISK FACTOR SUMMARY\nCOMPANY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\nIf the market for our data management, machine learning and analytics platform develops more slowly than we expect, our growth may slow or stall, and our operating results could be harmed.\nThe market for a data management, machine learning and analytics platform is relatively new, rapidly evolving and unproven. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to penetrate the existing market for data management, machine learning and analytics platforms, as well as the continued growth and expansion of that market. It is difficult to predict customer adoption and renewals of our subscriptions, customer demand for our platform, the size, growth rate and expansion of this market, the entry of competitive products or the success of existing competitive products. Our ability to penetrate the existing market for data management, machine learning and analytics platforms and any expansion of that market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with our platform, as well as potential customers\u2019 willingness to adopt an alternative approach to data collection, storage and processing. Many potential customers have made significant investments in legacy data collection, storage and processing software and may be unwilling to invest in new solutions. If data management, machine learning and analytics platforms do not achieve widespread adoption, or there is a reduction in demand caused by a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, weakening economic conditions, security or privacy concerns, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending or otherwise, it could result in decreased revenue and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market for data management, machine learning and analytics platforms is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, industry standards and frequent new product introductions and improvements. Our main sources of current and potential competition include public cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure, and cloud-native data management companies, such as Snowflake and Databricks. In addition, because we are primarily an open source company, there is also a risk that our customers or potential customers will choose to self-support.\nOur larger competitors, including the public cloud providers, have certain advantages such as greater scale, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and broader and more diverse product and service offering. In addition, they may be able to leverage their relationships with distribution partners and customers based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our platform, including by selling at zero or negative margins, product bundling or offering closed technology platforms.\nNew and innovative start-up companies, including emerging cloud-native data management companies, and larger companies that are making significant investments in research and development, may introduce products that have greater performance or functionality, are easier or cheaper to implement or use, or incorporate technological advances that we have not yet developed or implemented or may invent similar or superior products and technologies that compete with our platform.\nWe have invested significantly in our Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) offering and if it fails to achieve market adoption our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe introduced CDP Public Cloud in September 2019, Data Center (now known as CDP Private Cloud Base) in November 2019, and CDP Private Cloud in August 2020. We have less experience with marketing, determining pricing for and selling CDP, and we are continuing to refine our approach to selling, marketing, pricing and supporting adoption of this offering. We have directed, and intend to continue to direct, a significant portion of our financial and operating resources to develop and grow CDP, including offering trials to existing and potential customers. We cannot guarantee that CDP will be adopted broadly. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to drive customer adoption of CDP, which may be adversely impacted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, or if we do so in a way that is not profitable or fails to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nBecause of the characteristics of open source software, there may be fewer technology barriers to entry in the open source market by new competitors and it may be relatively easy for new and existing competitors with greater resources than we have to compete with us.\nOne of the characteristics of open source software is that the governing license terms generally allow liberal modifications of the code and distribution thereof to a wide group of companies and/or individuals. As a result, others could easily develop new software products or services based upon those open source programs that compete with existing open source software that we support and incorporate into our platform. Our licensing model might be ineffective to slow or alter these competitive dynamics. Such competition with use of the open source projects that we utilize can materialize without the same degree of overhead and lead time required by us, particularly if the customers do not value the differentiation of our proprietary components.\nIf our customers do not renew or expand their subscriptions, or if they renew on less favorable terms, our future revenue and operating results will be harmed.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to sell renewals of subscriptions and expand the deployment of our platform with existing customers. Achieving renewal or expansion of subscriptions may require us to increasingly engage in sophisticated and costly sales efforts. While we generally offer subscriptions of up to three years in length, our customers often purchase one-year subscriptions which generally do not provide for automatic renewal or a right to terminate the subscription early. Our customers may not renew or expand the use of their subscriptions after the expiration of their current subscription agreements. In addition, our customers may reduce their spend by opting for a lower priced edition of our platform or decreasing their usage of our platform. Our customers\u2019 renewal and/or expansion pricing rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of factors, including, but not limited to, their satisfaction with our platform including CDP and our customer support, the frequency and severity of software and implementation errors, our platform\u2019s reliability, the pricing of our subscriptions and services or of competing solutions or services, the effects of global economic conditions, and their ability to continue their operations and spending levels. Our implementation of a \u201cpay wall\u201d for the distribution of some of our software solutions might prove ineffective at improving our renewal and/or expansion rates with existing customers or deal close rates with new customers. We cannot assure you that our customers will renew or expand their subscriptions, and if our customers, particularly our large customers, do not renew their agreements or renew on less favorable terms or for less usage, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline and our business could suffer.\nWe do not have an adequate history with our subscription or pricing models to accurately predict the long-term rate of customer adoption or renewal, or the impact these will have on our revenue or operating results.\nWe have limited experience with respect to determining the optimal prices and pricing models for our solutions, especially as we develop and sell new offerings such as CDP. As the markets for our solutions mature, or as new competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, we may be unable to attract new customers at the same price or based on the same pricing model as we have used historically. Moreover, large customers, which are the focus of our sales efforts, may demand greater discounts. In addition, as an increasing amount of our business may move to our cloud-based solutions for transient workloads and the use of our consumption-based pricing model may represent a greater share of our revenue, our revenue may be less predictable or more variable than our historical revenue from a time period-based subscription pricing model. Moreover, a consumption-based subscription pricing model may ultimately result in lower total cost to our customers over time, or may cause our customers to limit usage in order to stay within the limits of their existing subscriptions, reducing overall revenue or making it more difficult for us to compete in our markets.\nWe have a history of losses, and we may not become profitable in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses since our founding in 2008, including net losses of $162.7 million, $336.6 million and $192.6 million for the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, and expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. As a result, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.6 billion as of January 31, 2021. These losses and accumulated deficit reflect the substantial investments we made to acquire new customers, commercialize our platform, participate in the open source development community and develop our proprietary software components, and continue to develop our platform. Furthermore, to the extent we are successful in increasing our customer base, we may also incur increased losses because customer acquisition costs and upfront costs associated with new customers are higher in the first year than the aggregate revenue we recognize from those new customers in the first year.\nWe expect to continue to make significant future expenditures related to the development and expansion of our business. As a result of these increased expenses, we will have to generate and sustain increased revenue to be profitable in future periods. Further, in future periods, our revenue growth rate could decline, and we may not be able to generate\nsufficient revenue to offset higher costs and achieve or sustain profitability. If we fail to achieve, sustain or increase profitability, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur results may fluctuate significantly from period to period, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock.\nOur results of operations may vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, our results for any particular period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. In addition to the other risks described herein, factors that may affect our results of operations include the following:\n\u2022the budgeting cycles and purchasing practices of our customers, including their tendency to purchase in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, near the end of each quarter, and the timing of subsequent contract renewals;\n\u2022the achievement of milestones in connection with delivery of services, impacting the timing of services revenue recognition, especially due to the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022subscriptions from large enterprises;\n\u2022price competition;\n\u2022our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers, and expand penetration within our existing customer base;\n\u2022the timing and success of new products and solutions by us and our competitors;\n\u2022changes in customer requirements or market needs and our ability to make corresponding changes to our business;\n\u2022changes in the competitive landscape;\n\u2022the timing and amount of certain payments and expenses;\n\u2022our inability to adjust certain fixed costs and expenses, particularly in research and development, for changes in demand;\n\u2022increases or decreases in our revenue and expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022the cost of and potential outcomes of existing and future claims or litigation;\n\u2022potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets;\n\u2022future accounting pronouncements and changes in our accounting policies; and\n\u2022changes in tax laws, tax regulations and governmental regulations.\nAny one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors above may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our revenue or other operating result expectations or those of investors for a particular period.\nBecause we derive substantially all of our revenue from a single software platform, failure of this platform to satisfy customer demands or to achieve increased market acceptance could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\nWe derive and expect to continue to derive substantially all of our revenue from our data management, machine learning and analytics platform. As such, the market acceptance of our platform is critical to our continued success. Demand for our platform is affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including continued market acceptance, the timing of development and release of new products by our competitors, technological change, any developments or disagreements with the open source community, growth or contraction in our market and general economic conditions. We expect the growth and proliferation of data to lead to an increase in the data analysis demands of our customers, and our platform may not be able to scale and perform to meet those demands or may not be chosen by users for those needs. If we are unable to continue to meet customer demands or to achieve more widespread market acceptance of our platform and solutions, our business operations, financial results and growth prospects will be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause we recognize a substantial portion of our subscription revenue from our platform over the subscription term, downturns or upturns in new sales and renewals will not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the subscription period. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions, or a reduction in expansion rates, in any single quarter could have only a small impact on our revenue results during that quarter or subsequent period. Such a decline or deceleration, however, will negatively affect our revenue or revenue growth rates in future quarters.\nOur revenue growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties and their continued performance.\nWe seek to grow our partner ecosystem as a way to grow our business. We anticipate that we will continue to establish and maintain relationships with third parties, such as resellers, OEMs, system integrators, independent software and hardware vendors and platform and cloud service providers. In addition, we work closely with select vendors (Partner Solutions) to design solutions to specifically address the needs of certain industry verticals or use cases within those verticals. We cannot guarantee that these partners will continue to devote the resources necessary to expand our reach and increase our distribution. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results may suffer.\nThe sum of our revenue and changes in contract liabilities or remaining performance obligations (RPO) may not be an accurate indicator of business activity within a period.\nInvestors or analysts sometimes look to the sum of the revenue and changes in contract liabilities or RPO as indicators of business activity in a period for businesses such as ours. They may use this information to estimate billings or bookings. However, these measures may significantly differ from underlying business activity for a number of reasons including:\n\u2022Since a relatively large number of transactions occur at the end of the quarter, and invoicing or enablement of those transactions may or may not occur before the end of the quarter based on a number of factors including receipt of information from the customer, volume of transactions and holidays, a shift of a few days has little economic impact on our business, but may shift contract liabilities or RPO from one period into the next;\n\u2022multi-year upfront billings that may distort trends;\n\u2022revenue recognition recorded pursuant to ASC 606.\nAccordingly, we do not believe that estimated billings is an accurate indicator of future revenue for any given period of time.\nIf our new products, components or enhancements to our platform do not achieve sufficient market acceptance, our financial results and competitive position will suffer.\nWhen we develop a new product (such as CDP), component or enhancement to our platform, we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to develop, market and promote the new component. Therefore, when we develop and introduce new products, components or enhancements to our platform, they must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order to justify the amount of our investment in developing and bringing them to market.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has caused significant volatility in financial markets and has raised the prospect of an extended global recession. Public health problems resulting from COVID-19 and precautionary measures instituted by governments and businesses to mitigate its spread, including travel restrictions and quarantines, have contributed to a general slowdown in the global economy, and could adversely impact our customers and business partners and disrupt our operations.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, mandatory work-from-home policies and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as required by government authorities and regulations or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. Most of our employees continue to work remotely. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. Furthermore, these operational changes may have a negative impact on our business, due to the inefficiencies of working from home, the inability of our sales force to travel, and the lack of access to customer sites by our professional services delivery teams.\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the pandemic, the impact on capital and financial markets and the related impact on the financial circumstances of our customers, business partners and vendors, all of which are highly\nuncertain and cannot be predicted. This situation is changing rapidly, and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nMERGER AND ACQUISITION RISKS\nWe may acquire or invest in companies and technologies, which may divert our management\u2019s attention, and result in additional dilution to our stockholders. We may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions or investments.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have acquired companies in the past and may evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of, investments in, or partnerships with, businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets in the future. An acquisition, investment, or partnership may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us, their technology is not easily adapted to work with ours, or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in ownership, management or otherwise. Negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to close these transactions may often be subject to conditions or approvals that are beyond our control.\nThese transactions may be complex and expensive, and may also disrupt our business, divert our resources, and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our existing business. Any such transactions that we are able to complete may not result in any synergies or other benefits we had expected to achieve, which could result in impairment charges that could be substantial. To the extent we pay the consideration for any future acquisitions or investments in cash, the payment would reduce the amount of cash available to us for other purposes. These transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if the resulting business from such a transaction fails to meet our expectations or generate the expected benefits, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected or we may be exposed to unknown risks or liabilities.\nCYBERSECURITY RISKS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS\nSecurity and privacy breaches may hurt our business.\nAny security breach, including those resulting from a cybersecurity attack, or any unauthorized access, unauthorized usage, virus or similar breach or disruption could result in the loss of confidential information, damage to our reputation, early termination of our contracts, litigation, regulatory investigations or other liabilities. If our security measures or the security measures we have provided to customers are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 confidential information, our reputation may be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability.\nTechniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived security breach occurs, the market perception of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers.\nIn addition, many of our customers use our platform to store and process vast quantities of private and otherwise sensitive data that are critical to their businesses. They may have a greater sensitivity to security defects in our products than to defects in other, less critical, software products. An actual or perceived security breach or theft of the business-critical data of one of our customers, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to the failure of our products or services, could adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of our security products. Moreover, if a high-profile security breach occurs with respect to another data management, machine learning and analytics platform provider, our customers and potential customers may lose trust in the security of data management, machine learning and analytics platforms generally, which could adversely impact our ability to retain existing customers or attract new ones.\nWe have been, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property rights claims by third parties, which are extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.\nCompanies in the software and technology industries, including some of our current and potential competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, many of these companies have\nthe capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. The litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners that have no relevant product revenue and against which our patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence. From time-to-time, third parties, including certain other companies, have asserted and may assert patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights against us, our partners or our customers. We or our customers have received, and may in the future receive, notices that claim we have misappropriated, misused or infringed other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, and, to the extent we gain greater market visibility, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims, which is not uncommon with respect to the enterprise software market.\nThere may be third-party intellectual property rights, including issued or pending patents, that cover significant aspects of our technologies, or the technologies in our platform or business methods. We may be exposed to increased risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims as a result of acquisitions and our use of open source software. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be very time-consuming, could be expensive to settle or litigate and could divert our management\u2019s attention and other resources. These claims could also subject us to significant liability for damages. These claims could also result in our having to stop using, distributing or supporting technology found to be in violation of a third-party\u2019s rights. We might be required to seek a license for the intellectual property, which may be expensive or may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. As a result, we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense. If we cannot license or develop technology for any infringing aspect of our business, we could be forced to limit or stop sales of our offerings and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results could adversely affect our business operations and financial results.\nThird parties have asserted, and may continue to assert, such claims against our customers or partners whom we typically indemnify against claims that our solutions infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties, including in the third-party open source components included in our platform, as well as our own open source and proprietary components. As the numbers of products and competitors in our market increase and overlaps occur, claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase. Also, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or have divulged proprietary or other confidential information.\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop under patent and other intellectual property laws of the United States and other jurisdictions outside of the United States so that we can prevent others from using our inventions and proprietary information. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, and our business may be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense. Any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have patents and patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs.\nMoreover, despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our platform or offerings or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We cannot guarantee that any of the measures we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology.\nWe may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel.\nOur platform is largely based on open source technology, which could negatively affect our ability to operate our business and sell our products and solutions, and could subject us to possible litigation.\nOur solutions include software covered by open source licenses, which may include, by way of example, GNU General Public License and the Apache License. Our use of open source software in our solutions could negatively affect our ability to operate our business and sell our platform, and could subject us to possible litigation. The risks related to our open source model include:\n\u2022Any undetected errors or defects in the open source software we use could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our solutions, delay the introduction of new solution, result in a failure of our solutions,\ncreate vulnerabilities that could inadvertently permit access to protected customer data, result in liability to our customers, and injure our reputation;\n\u2022We do not control and may be unable to predict the future course of open source technology development, including the ongoing development of open source components used in our platform, which could reduce the market appeal of our platform and damage our reputation. Also, different open source projects may overlap or compete with the ones that we incorporate into our platform;\n\u2022We rely on a number of open source software programmers, or committers and contributors, to develop and enhance components of our platform. Additionally, members of the corresponding open source project management committees, many of whom are not employed by us, are primarily responsible for the oversight and evolution of the codebases of important components of the open source data management ecosystem. If open source software programmers, many of whom we do not employ, or our own internal programmers do not continue to develop and enhance open source technologies, then we would need to expend additional resources to develop and enhance our platform, and we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price;\n\u2022Important components of our platform have been provided under the Apache License, Version 2.0. This license states that any work of authorship licensed under it, and any derivative work thereof, may be reproduced and distributed provided that certain conditions are met. It is possible that a court would hold this license to be unenforceable or that someone could assert a claim for proprietary rights in a program developed and distributed under it. Any ruling by a court that this license is not enforceable, or that open source components of our platform may not be reproduced or distributed, may negatively impact our distribution or development of all or a portion of our solutions;\n\u2022The Apache License may be modified, which could negatively impact our continuing development or distribution of the software code subject to the new or modified license;\n\u2022Our business relies on the Apache Software Foundation, a non-profit corporation that supports Apache open source software projects. We do not control nor can we predict the decisions the ASF will make with respect to the further development and enhancement of open source technologies which may impact our business. Moreover, if the ASF is subject to claims, disputes or otherwise suffers reputational harm, our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects could be harmed if customers perceive our solutions to be risky or inferior to data management solutions which do not rely on the ASF for continued development and enhancement of open source technologies;\n\u2022We do not own all of the open source technology in our platform and the ownership of the open source technology in our platform may not be easily determinable by us. Rather, we rely on the ASF as well as certain other third-party open source contributors to ensure that the open source contributions to our platform are properly owned by the committers and contributors who contribute the open source technology and that such contributions do not infringe on other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights;\n\u2022The terms of certain of the open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts or other courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that is incompatible with our current business model, imposing unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our solutions;\n\u2022We or our customers could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of (or that different license terms apply to) what we believe to be open source software, or seeking to enforce the terms of an open source license;\n\u2022By the terms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be impacted by an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies and services, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technologies and cause us to have to significantly alter our current business model. These claims could also result in litigation (including litigation against our customers or partners, which could result in us being obligated to indemnify our customers or partners against such litigation), require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solutions, any of which could have a negative effect on our business and operating results. In addition, if the license terms for the open source code change, we may be forced to re-engineer our solutions or incur additional costs to find alternative tools;\n\u2022Usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties, support, indemnity or assurance of title or controls on origin of the software.\nReal or perceived errors, failures, bugs or disruptions in our platform and solutions could adversely affect our reputation and business could be harmed.\nOur platform and solutions are very complex and incorporate a variety of hardware, open source software, proprietary software and third-party software, and have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors, especially when solutions are first introduced or enhanced, or as we develop new platform such as CDP. In addition, cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. Such defects could create vulnerabilities that could inadvertently permit access to protected customer data.\nIf our platform is not implemented or used correctly or as intended, inadequate performance and disruption in service may result. Moreover, as we acquire companies and integrate new open source data management projects, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the newly-obtained technologies into our platform and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our reputation.\nSince our customers use our platform and solutions for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers\u2019 businesses. As a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. We could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. We could also receive negative publicity, which will harm our reputation. Furthermore, defects in our platform and solutions may require us to implement design changes or software updates.\nHUMAN RESOURCE RISKS\nIf we are unable to hire, retain, train and motivate qualified personnel and senior management, our business could be harmed.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, integrate and retain qualified and highly skilled personnel. In particular, we are substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing engineering and sales personnel because of the complexity of our platform and are also highly dependent on the contributions of our executive team. New hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity, especially as new offerings are developed and released. The loss of any key personnel, including executives and members of our leadership team, could seriously harm our business.\nIn addition, we have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. There is significant competition for sales and engineering personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. If we are unable to attract, integrate, or retain the qualified and highly skilled personnel required to fulfill our current or future needs, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods and expect our growth to continue. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. This growth has placed, and any future growth will place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. If we fail to manage our growth, or if we fail to implement improvements or maintain effective internal controls, our costs and expenses may increase more than we plan and our ability to expand our customer base, enhance our platform, develop new solutions, expand penetration within existing customers, respond to competitive pressures or otherwise execute our business plan, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nINTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS RISKS\nAs we expand internationally, our business will become more susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nWe have expanded internationally and intend to continue such international expansion. For example, we sell the various editions of our platform through our direct sales force, which is comprised of inside sales and field sales personnel, and is located in a variety of geographic regions, including the United States, Europe and Asia, and have customers located in approximately 100 countries as of January 31, 2021. We intend to continue to expand internationally.\nConducting international operations subjects us to risks that we have not generally faced in the United States. These risks include:\n\u2022challenges caused by distance, language, cultural and ethical differences and the competitive environment;\n\u2022heightened risks of unethical, unfair or corrupt business practices, actual or claimed, in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, and irregularities in, financial statements or liability under laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010 (the UK Bribery Act);\n\u2022foreign exchange restrictions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, including that, because a majority of our international contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, an increase in the strength of the U.S. dollar may make doing business with us less appealing to a non-U.S. dollar denominated customer;\n\u2022application of multiple and conflicting laws and regulations, including complications due to unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign import requirements, including the importation, certification and localization of our solutions required in foreign countries, as well as changes in trade, tariffs, restrictions or requirements;\n\u2022new and different sources of competition;\n\u2022potentially different pricing environments, longer sales cycles and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;\n\u2022management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural differences and geographic dispersion;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences, including multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures, the complexities of foreign value-added tax systems, restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and changes in tax rates;\n\u2022the uncertainty and limitation of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and the risk of potential theft or compromises of our technology, data or intellectual property;\n\u2022increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022lack of familiarity with local laws, customs and practices, and laws and business practices favoring local competitors or partners;\n\u2022increased exposure to natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, epidemics, or pandemics and other health crises, including the current COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022political, social and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general.\nThe occurrence of any one of these risks could harm our international business and, consequently, our results of operations. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to operate in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.\nWe are subject to governmental export control, sanctions and import laws and regulations that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nBecause we incorporate encryption functionality into our platform (including any products comprising the platform), we are subject to certain U.S. export control laws that apply to encryption items. As such, our platform may be exported outside the United States through an export license exception; an export license is required to certain countries, end-users and end-uses. If we were to fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could be subject to both civil and criminal penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale or offering may not be possible and may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the export of products to certain U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons, as well as for prohibited end-uses. Monitoring and ensuring compliance with these complex U.S. export control laws is particularly challenging because our platform and related services are widely distributed throughout the world and are available for download without registration. Even though we take precautions to ensure that we and our reseller partners comply with all relevant export control laws and regulations, any failure by us or our reseller partners to comply with such laws and regulations could have negative consequences for us, including reputational harm, government investigations and penalties.\nIn addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permit and license requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our platform or could limit our end-customers\u2019 ability to implement our products in those countries. Any change in export or import laws or regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing export, import or sanctions laws or regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such export,\nimport or sanctions laws or regulations, could result in delayed deployment or decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to, existing or potential end-customers with international operations.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nWe have incurred a significant amount of debt. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $491 million aggregate principal amount. We may be required to use a portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise.\nIn addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions.\nAny default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay our loans immediately, and may limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.\nIn addition, we are exposed to interest rate risk related to some of our indebtedness, which is discussed in greater detail under the section titled \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.\u201d included in Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur failure to raise additional capital could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business.\nWe expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future. However, if we change our business strategy, we may need to raise additional funds in the future, and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock could decline. Certain of our existing debt instruments contain, and any debt financing we secure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur additional indebtedness and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business opportunities. Furthermore, if we engage in additional debt financing, the holders of debt would have priority over the holders of common stock. We may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders and force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios, any of which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nLEGAL, TAX, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nFederal, state, foreign government and industry regulations, as well as self-regulation related to privacy and data security concerns, pose the threat of lawsuits and other liabilities.\nWe collect and utilize demographic and other information, including personally identifiable information, from and about our employees and our existing and potential customers and partners. Such information may be collected from our customers and partners when they visit our website or through their use of our products and interactions with our company and employees such as when signing up for certain services, registering for training seminars, participating in a survey, participating in polls or signing up to receive e-mail newsletters.\nA wide variety of domestic and international laws and regulations (including, for example, the General Data Protection Regulation that became effective in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act that became effective on January 1, 2020) apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. These data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and may result in regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to protect such data, could result in enforcement action against us, including fines, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing customers and prospective customers). Evolving and changing definitions of personal data and personal information within the European Union, the United States, and elsewhere may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business.\nLoss, retention or misuse of certain information and alleged violations of laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security, and any relevant claims, may expose us to potential liability and may require us to expend significant resources on data security and in responding to and defending such allegations and claims.\nA portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities and heavily regulated organizations, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks.\nA portion of our sales are to governmental entities. Additionally, many of our current and prospective customers, such as those in the financial services and health care industries, are highly regulated and may be required to comply with more stringent regulations in connection with subscribing to and deploying our platform. Selling to these entities can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will result in a sale. Government and highly regulated entities often require contract terms that differ from our standard arrangements and impose compliance requirements that are complicated, require preferential pricing or \u201cmost favored nation\u201d terms and conditions, or are otherwise time consuming and expensive to satisfy. If we undertake to meet special standards or requirements and do not meet them, we could be subject to increased liability from our customers or regulators. Even if we do meet them, the additional costs associated with providing our services to government and highly regulated customers could harm our margins. Moreover, changes in the underlying regulatory conditions that affect these types of customers could harm our ability to efficiently provide our services to them and to grow or maintain our customer base.\nAdditionally, government certification requirements for platforms like ours may change and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into certain government sectors until we have attained the revised certification. Government demand and payment for our solutions may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our solutions. Additionally, government entities routinely investigate and audit government contractors\u2019 administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government entity refusing to continue buying our solutions, a reduction of revenue, fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, which could adversely impact our operating results. Furthermore, engaging in sales activities to foreign governments introduces additional compliance risks specific to the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and other similar statutory requirements prohibiting bribery and corruption in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports that are filed with the SEC.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year. Our independent registered public accounting firm has to\nissue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results and could cause a decline in the price of our common stock.\nIf we have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. Moreover, failure to demonstrate continued compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and sanctions, impair our ability to raise revenue, cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, subject us to stockholder or other third-party litigation as well as investigations and delisting, as applicable, by the New York Stock Exchange, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, and negatively affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC, and other various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. Changes in accounting principles could adversely affect our financial results. Any difficulties in implementing these pronouncements could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors\u2019 confidence in us.\nChanges in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results.\nWe are subject to income taxation in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Determining our provision for income taxes requires significant management judgment. In addition, our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by many factors, including, among other things, changes to our operating or holding structure, changes in the amounts of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws. We could be subject to tax examinations in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our use of research and development tax credits, intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes. While we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, there can be no assurance that the outcomes of such examinations will not have a material impact on our operating results and cash flows.\nIn addition, we may be subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe enactment of legislation implementing United States based changes in taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nRecent changes to United States tax laws, including limitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the United States are repatriated to the United States, as well as changes to United States tax laws that may be enacted in the future, could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. Due to expansion of our international business activities, any changes in the United States taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (NOLs) to offset future taxable income. If our NOLs are subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, our ability to utilize NOLs could be limited by Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), tax losses generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be utilized to offset no\nmore than 80% of taxable income annually. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES Act, was signed into law. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021, the CARES Act eliminates the limitation on the deduction of NOLs to 80% of current year taxable income. However, that limitation remains for later taxable years. It is also uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act, as modified by the CARES Act. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a portion of the NOLs reflected on our balance sheet, even if we attain profitability.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe stock price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe market price for our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. Since our initial public offering, our stock price has ranged from $4.76 to $23.35, through January 31, 2021. The market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the factors included in this Risk Factors section as well as:\n\u2022COVID-19 and any associated economic downturn;\n\u2022the economy as a whole and market conditions in our industry and the equity markets;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or net revenue expansion rate;\n\u2022changes in the financial projections we may provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors, even if we meet our own projections;\n\u2022recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u2022actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or our offerings, or third-party proprietary rights;\n\u2022dilution associated with mergers and acquisitions;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, or responses to these events; and\n\u2022repurchases of shares of our common stock by us and sales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders.\nStockholders have, from time to time, instituted securities class action litigation following periods of stock price volatility. For example, after we announced earnings for the quarter ended April 30, 2019, our stock price dropped and several securities litigation lawsuits were initiated. The current securities litigation cases, as well as any future securities litigation that we may become involved in, could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur directors, executive officers and principal stockholders continue to have substantial control over us, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nOur directors, executive officers and our stockholders who own greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock, together with their affiliates, beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 35.2% of our outstanding common stock, based on the number of shares outstanding as of February 28, 2021. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, have the ability to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. In addition, these stockholders, acting together, have the ability to influence or control the governance, management and affairs of our company. They may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree, and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nIcahn Enterprises L.P. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, the Icahn Group) holds approximately 18.0% of our outstanding common stock, based on the number of shares outstanding as of February 28, 2021. As such, the Icahn Group could have considerable influence over matters such as approving a potential acquisition of us. The Icahn Group\u2019s investment in and position in our company, including the various agreements we entered into with them, could also discourage others from pursuing any potential acquisition of us, which could have the effect of depriving the holders of our common stock of the opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over the prevailing market price.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. In addition, our existing debt instruments include restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends.\nDefensive measures in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors who are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022the right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy;\n\u2022a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer, our lead director, if any, or a majority vote of our board of directors;\n\u2022the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 662/3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to amend our amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022the requirement that in order for a stockholder to be eligible to propose a nomination or other business to be considered at an annual meeting of our stockholders, such stockholder must have continuously beneficially owned at least 1% of our outstanding common stock for a period of one year before giving such notice; and\n\u2022advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder.\nIn addition, under our existing debt instruments, we, and certain of our subsidiaries, are subject to certain limitations on our business and operations, including limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets. For information regarding these and other provisions, see the risk factor titled \u201cWe have incurred a significant amount of debt. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.\u201d\nGENERAL RISKS\nAdverse economic conditions may negatively impact our business.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers. Any significant weakening of the economy in the United States or Europe and of the global economy, more limited availability of credit, global economic and political uncertainties, a reduction in business confidence and activity, decreased government spending, economic uncertainty and other difficulties, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, may have affected, and may continue to affect, one or more of the sectors or countries in which we sell our applications, causing our customers or potential customers to curtail spending. In addition,\ngeopolitical developments, such as existing and potential trade wars, and other events beyond our control, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and the volatility of global financial markets. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have shifted certain of our customer events to virtual-only experiences and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional customer, employee or industry events in the future. In addition, a strong dollar could reduce demand for our products in countries with relatively weaker currencies. These adverse conditions could result in reductions in sales of our applications, longer sales cycles, reductions in subscription duration and value, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial position.", "PERMNO": 16657, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "CLDR"}
