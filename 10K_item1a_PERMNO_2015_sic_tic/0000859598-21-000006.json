RISK FACTORS\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by numerous risks. Material risks that the Company is aware of are summarized and described in more detail below, but there could be risks of which the Company is not aware or risks that could be material that are not identified as such at this time. Carefully consider the risks summarized and described in detail below, as well as the other information that has been provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks and circumstances, not presently known to management, or perceived as a threat, may exist or materialize and could also impair the Company\u2019s business operations. Material risks that may affect our business, operating results and financial condition include, but are not necessarily limited to, those relating to:\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\u2022the COVID-19 outbreak and its impact on the global economy;\n\u2022construction of refined petroleum product, natural gas or crude oil pipelines;\n\u2022declining demand for our products or changes in existing methods of delivery;\n\u2022loss of customers or marketing agreements;\n\u2022increase in the supply of vessels, barges or equipment the Company operates could have an adverse impact on the rates earned by the Company\u2019s vessels, barges and equipment;\n\u2022inability to renew or replace expiring customer contracts;\n\u2022the lease from third parties of certain vessels the Company operates;\n\u2022exposure to liability from hazards customary for the operation of vessels;\n\u2022failure to successfully complete construction or conversion of the Company\u2019s vessels, repairs, maintenance or routine dry-dockings on schedule and on budget;\n\u2022unexpected dry-dock costs for the Company\u2019s vessels;\n\u2022the aging infrastructure on the U.S. Inland Waterways may lead to increased costs and disruptions in Inland Services\u2019 operations;\nRisks Related to the Merger Agreement\n\u2022the announcement and pendency of our acquisition pursuant to the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022delay or disruption to the proposed acquisition due to failure to satisfy various conditions;\n\u2022failure to complete the tender offer and the merger;\n\u2022litigation connected to the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022restrictions on business operations imposed by the Merger Agreement prior to closing;\n\u2022the Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a third party from acquiring us prior to the completion of the tender offer and the merger;\n\u2022if the tender offer and the merger are completed, our current stockholders will forego any future increase in our value;\n\u2022our executive officers and directors may have interests that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally;\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results, Finances and Capital Structure\n\u2022risks associated with the Company\u2019s debt structure;\n\u2022exposure to risks based on hedging activities;\n\u2022the potentially limited ability to access capital markets;\n\u2022certain foreign currency, interest rate, fixed-income, equity and commodity price risks;\n\u2022maintaining the Company\u2019s current fleet size and configuration and acquiring vessels required for additional future growth;\n\u2022risks related to internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022Increased security and inspection procedures and tighter import and export controls could increase costs and disrupt the Company\u2019s business;\n\u2022risks related to Inland Services;\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u2022adverse affect on the liquidity of the Company\u2019s Common Stock that may occur due to the restrictions in the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws;\n\u2022if non-U.S. citizens own more than 22.5% of SEACOR\u2019s Common Stock, the Company may not have the funds or the ability to redeem any excess shares and it could be forced to suspend its operations in the U.S. coastwise trade;\n\u2022adverse affect on the market price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock that may occur due to significant exercises of stock options or conversion of convertible debt;\nRisks Related to Legal, Tax and Regulatory Matters\n\u2022changes in U.S. policies governing foreign trade, international travel, immigration, manufacturing and foreign investment;\n\u2022the potential for adverse results of legal proceedings;\n\u2022risks associated with international operations;\n\u2022the Company and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities if there is a determination that the Spin-off was taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes;\n\u2022potential liability in connection with the Company\u2019s provision of spill response services, as well as its obligations relating to the Deepwater Horizon incident;\n\u2022repeal, Amendment, Suspension or Non-Enforcement of the Jones Act would result in additional competition for Ocean Services and Inland Services;\n\u2022the Company\u2019s potential inability to sell off its business due to restrictions on non-U.S. citizen ownership of the its vessels;\n\u2022compliance with complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has and will likely continue to negatively affect the global economy and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's businesses, results of operations and financial condition. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the responses of governments worldwide to COVID-19, are having a negative impact on regional, national and global economies and reducing international trade and business activity. The pandemic has caused many governments throughout the world to implement stay-at-home orders, quarantines, significant restrictions on travel and other social distancing measures including restrictions that prohibit many employees from commuting to their customary work locations. Many of these restrictions have remained in place for months and in light of recent increases in infections rates, as well as the emergence of more contagious strains of the virus, may continue in one fashion or another for the foreseeable future. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022Our ability to operate, as well as our partners' and/or customers' ability to operate in affected areas, has been and may continue to be hindered, which may cause our business and operating results to decline.\n\u2022Customers may have difficulty meeting their payment obligations to us.\n\u2022A significant outbreak out one or more facilities utilized by us to perform maintenance on our vessels could delay both scheduled and unscheduled repair and maintenance activities.\n\u2022To the extent a number of our employees, including our executive officers, are impacted in significant numbers by the virus and are not available to work, our business and operating results may be negatively impacted.\n\u2022The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial performance and liquidity, will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, as well the timing of the global availability of vaccines and other therapeutic measures, none of which can be predicted.\nAny of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Furthermore, our business could be adversely affected in the future by the effects of other health epidemics and the widespread outbreak of different contagious diseases other than COVID-19.\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has not to date had a material effect on the Company's businesses or the Company\u2019s liquidity, it is a dynamic and continuously evolving phenomenon and the ultimate severity of the outbreak is uncertain at this time. If the pandemic worsens or additional restrictions are implemented to contain the outbreak, the Company may experience a material and adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nConstruction of additional refined petroleum product, natural gas or crude oil pipelines could have a material adverse effect on Ocean Services\u2019 revenues. Long-haul transportation of refined petroleum products, crude oil and natural gas is generally less costly by pipeline than by ship. Existing pipeline systems are either insufficient to meet demand in, or do not reach, all of the markets served by Ocean Services\u2019 petroleum and chemical carriers. As a result, the Company\u2019s customers require the services provided by Ocean Services to meet demand. However, the construction and operation of new pipeline segments could replace the demand for Ocean Services\u2019 services and have a material adverse effect on Ocean Services\u2019 business.\nRevenues from Ocean Services could be adversely affected by a decline in demand for domestic refined petroleum products, crude oil or chemical products, or a change in existing methods of delivery or consumption. A reduction in domestic consumption of refined petroleum products, crude oil or chemical products, whether as a result of a general economic slow-down, a dynamic global event such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or the availability of other sources of energy, or the widespread adoption of alternatives to engines that utilize oil and oil derivatives such as electronic engines for cars, trucks and other vehicles, as well as the development of alternative methods of delivery of such products, or an increase in domestic sources of such products or in refining capacity, could reduce demand for the Company\u2019s services.\nOcean Services, Inland Services and Witt O\u2019Brien\u2019s rely on several customers and marketing agreements for a significant share of their revenues, the loss of any of which could adversely affect each of their businesses and operating results. As of December 31, 2020, one Ocean Services customer accounted for 10% of the Company\u2019s consolidated operating revenues. While no other business had a single customer account for more than 10% of the Company's consolidated operating revenues, each do have customers that are significant to their results and the portion of Ocean Services, Inland Services and Witt O\u2019Brien\u2019s revenues attributable to any single customer may change over time, depending on the level of relevant activity by any such customer, the segment\u2019s ability to meet the customer\u2019s needs and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The loss by any segment of business from a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on such segment\u2019s or the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, to the extent any of the Company\u2019s customers experience an extended period of operating difficulty, the Company\u2019s revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely effected.\nConsolidation of the Company\u2019s customer base could adversely affect demand for its services and reduce its revenues. In recent years, oil and natural gas companies, energy companies, major grain exporters and farm cooperatives, importers and distributors of industrial materials, agricultural companies, fertilizer companies, trading companies, and industrial companies, which make up a significant portion of the Company\u2019s customer base, have undergone substantial consolidation and additional consolidation is possible. Consolidation results in fewer companies to charter or contract for the Company\u2019s services, which could adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s petroleum and chemical carriers thereby reducing the Company\u2019s revenues.\nAn increase in the supply of vessels, barges or equipment the Company operates could have an adverse impact on the rates earned by the Company\u2019s vessels, barges and equipment. The Company\u2019s industry is highly competitive, with vessel oversupply and intense price competition. Expansion of the supply of vessels, barges and equipment would further increase competition in the markets in which the Company operates. The refurbishment of disused or \u201cmothballed\u201d vessels and barges, conversion of vessels from other uses or construction of new vessels, barges and equipment could all add vessel, barge and equipment capacity to current worldwide levels. A significant increase in vessel, barge and equipment capacity could lower rates and result in lower operating revenues.\nThe Company may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts for its vessels. The Company\u2019s ability to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts, and the terms of any such contracts, for the use of its vessels will depend on various factors, including market conditions and the specific needs of the Company\u2019s customers. Given the highly competitive and historically cyclical nature of the Company\u2019s industry, the Company may not be able to renew or replace the contracts or may be required to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts at rates that are below, and potentially substantially below, existing rates, or that have terms that are less favorable to the Company than its existing contracts. In addition, price competition tends to increase in distressed economic environments. Further, newer, more technologically advanced vessels may be more desirable, and the presence of those vessels in our fleets and those of our competitors may decrease the demand for other vessels in our fleet and decrease the resale value of those other vessels. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company leases certain of the vessels it operates. Certain vessels operated by the Company are leased from third parties. The Company is exposed to the risk that the vessel owner may be unwilling or unable to continue to renew the leasing arrangement in the future on terms favorable to the Company or at all. If any such leases are terminated, the Company's ability to provide services to its customers could be adversely impacted.\nThe Company is subject to hazards customary for the operation of vessels that could disrupt operations and expose the Company to liability. The operation of petroleum and chemical carriers, short-sea container, Roll On/Roll Off vessels, Pure Car/Truck Carriers, bulk carriers, towboats, tugs and barges is subject to various risks, including catastrophic disaster, adverse weather, mechanical failure and collision. For instance, the Company\u2019s operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea may be adversely affected by weather, including severe hurricanes and tropical storms, which have adversely affected the Company in the past. Tropical storms and hurricanes may limit the Company\u2019s ability to operate its vessels in the proximity of storms, reduce development and production activity, result in the Company incurring additional expenses to secure equipment and facilities or require the Company to evacuate its vessels, personnel and equipment out of the path of a storm. Additional risks to vessels include adverse sea conditions, capsizing, grounding, oil and hazardous substance spills and navigation errors. These risks could endanger the safety of the Company\u2019s personnel, equipment, cargo and other property, as well as the environment. If any of these events were to occur, the Company could be held liable for resulting damages, including loss of revenues from or termination of charter contracts, higher insurance rates or loss of insurance, increased operating costs, increased governmental regulation and reporting and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and customer relationships. Any such events would likely result in negative publicity for the Company and adversely affect its safety record, which would likely affect demand for the Company\u2019s services. In addition, the affected vessels could be removed from service and would then not be available to generate revenues.\nThe failure to successfully complete construction or conversion of the Company\u2019s vessels, repairs, maintenance or routine dry-dockings on schedule and on budget could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. From time to time, the Company may have a number of vessels under conversion and may plan to construct or convert other vessels in response to current and future market conditions. The Company also routinely engages shipyards to dry-dock vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance services. Construction and conversion projects and dry-dockings are subject to risks of delay and cost overruns, resulting from shortages of equipment, lack of shipyard availability, unforeseen engineering problems, work stoppages, weather interference, unanticipated cost increases, inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals, and shortages of materials or skilled labor and, potentially, the outbreak of communicable diseases at the yards, such as COVID-19. A significant delay in either construction or dry-dockings could have a material adverse effect on contract commitments and revenues with respect to vessels under construction, conversion or undergoing dry-dockings. Significant cost overruns or delays for vessels under construction, conversion or retrofit could also adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company may face unexpected dry-dock costs for its vessels. Vessels must be dry-docked periodically for inspection and maintenance, and in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each dry-dock are difficult to predict with certainty, can be substantial and the Company's insurance may not cover these costs. Vessels in dry-dock will generally not generate any income. Large dry-docking expenses could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements. Large dry-docking expenses and longer than anticipated off-hire time could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe aging infrastructure on the U.S. Inland Waterways may lead to increased costs and disruptions in Inland Services\u2019 operations. Many of the locks and dams on the U.S. Inland Waterways were built early in the last century, and their age makes them costly to maintain and susceptible to unscheduled maintenance outages. Delays caused by malfunctioning locks and dams could increase Inland Services\u2019 operating costs and delay the delivery of cargoes. Moreover, in the future, increased taxes could be imposed on users of the U.S. Inland Waterways to fund necessary infrastructure improvements, and such increases may not be recoverable by Inland Services through pricing increases. In addition, infrastructure improvements in other such modes of transportation could result in increased competition for inland barge transport relative to other modes of transportation if such other modes of transportation become more economical or accessible. The foregoing risks could make inland barge transport less competitive than rail and other modes of transportation, and could adversely impact Inland Services\u2019 results of operations and cash flows.\nMaintaining the Company\u2019s current fleet size and configuration and acquiring vessels required for additional future growth require significant capital. Expenditures required for the repair, certification and maintenance of a vessel typically increase with vessel age. These expenditures may increase to a level at which they are not economically justifiable and, therefore, to maintain the Company\u2019s current fleet size, it may seek to construct or acquire additional vessels. Also, customers may prefer modern vessels over older vessels, especially in weaker markets and some potential customers may not be willing to use vessels older than a specified age, even if the vessel has been subsequently rebuilt. The cost of adding a new\nvessel to the Company\u2019s fleet can be substantial. The Company can give no assurance that it will have sufficient capital resources to build or acquire the vessels required to expand or to maintain its current fleet size and vessel configuration.\nOcean Services' participation in the MSP subjects the Company to certain financial risks. As noted in \"Item 1. Government Regulation - Regulatory Matters\" on this report, the Company currently receives an annual fee per vessel for participating in the MSP. These payments are subject to annual appropriations by the U.S. Congress. Although Congress has fully funded this program since its inception in 1996, there is no guarantee that it will continue to do so in the future. Moreover, supplemental revenues earned under this program for carrying U.S. governmental cargoes are volatile and depend substantially on the level of U.S. military and other government-impelled cargoes.\nInland Services\u2019 results of operations could be adversely affected by the decline in U.S. grain exports. Inland Services\u2019 business is significantly affected by the volume of grain exports handled through ports in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Grain exports can vary due to a number of factors including crop harvest yield levels in the United States and abroad, the demand for grain in the United States and international trade wars. A shortage of available grain overseas can increase demand for U.S. grain. Conversely, an abundance of grain overseas, or international tariffs on U.S. grain, can decrease demand for U.S. grain. For example, the deteriorating trade relationship between the U.S. and China has caused decreased demand for U.S. grain overseas. A decline in exports could result in excess barge capacity, which would likely lower freight rates earned by Inland Services and, in turn, Inland Services\u2019 results of operations.\nInland Services could experience variation in freight rates. Freight transportation rates may fluctuate as the volume of cargo and availability of barges change. The volume of freight transported on inland waterways may vary as a result of various factors, such as global economic conditions and business cycles, domestic and international agricultural production and demand, and foreign currency exchange rates. Barge participation in the industry can also vary year-to-year and is dependent on the number of barges built and retired from service. Extended periods of high barge availability and low cargo demand could adversely impact Inland Services.\nInland Services\u2019 results of operations are affected by seasonal activity. Inland Services\u2019 business is seasonal, and its quarterly revenues and profits have historically been lower in the first and second quarters of the year and higher in the third and fourth quarters, during the grain harvest. Expenses are not incurred and recognized evenly throughout the year. Because of these factors, Inland Services\u2019 quarterly operating results may be uneven and may be marked by lower revenues and earnings in some quarters than in others.\nInland Services\u2019 results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by fuel price fluctuations. Primarily, Inland Services purchases towboat and fleeting services from third party vendors. The price of these services can rise when fuel prices escalate and could adversely impact Inland Services\u2019 results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to the Merger Agreement\nThe announcement and pendency of our acquisition by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement could have an adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and operations. The announcement and pendency of the proposed acquisition could negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial performance, operating results, share price, and the Company\u2019s relationship with customers, suppliers, other business partners, management and employees.\nThe proposed acquisition by Parent is subject to satisfying various conditions that may delay or prevent the completion of the acquisition. The completion of the tender offer and the merger are subject to a number of conditions, including (i) that the number of SEACOR common stock validly tendered and \u201creceived\u201d (as defined in Section 251(h)(6) of the Delaware General Corporation Law), and not validly withdrawn, prior to the expiration of the tender offer, together with the number of common stock then-owned by Parent or its affiliates represent one more share than 66 and 2/3% of the total number of common stock shares outstanding at the expiration of the tender offer, (ii) the accuracy, subject to various standards, of the Company\u2019s representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement and (iii) the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement). Even though we and the other parties to the Merger Agreement are required to use reasonable best efforts to satisfy these conditions, we can give no assurance that all such conditions will be satisfied. For instance, upon the initial expiration of the tender offer, less than the required number of shares were tendered and Parent extended the offer as required by the Merger Agreement. No assurance can be given that the extension of the deadline will, either in isolation or with other amendments to the terms of the merger, be sufficient to cause the requisite number of shares to be tendered.\nFailure to complete the tender offer and the merger could negatively affect our operating results, prospects and financial condition. We cannot assure that the tender offer and the merger will be completed. If the tender offer and the merger are not completed, we will be subject to several risks. The failure to close may impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel, and could cause partners and others to seek to change existing business relationships with the Company. Further, we have incurred and will incur significant costs in connection with the tender offer and the merger, including the diversion of management resources, for which we will have received little or no benefit if the tender offer and the merger are not consummated. In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement\nunder specified circumstances (which do not include failure to complete the tender offer), we may be obligated to pay Parent a termination fee of $29,000,000.\nLitigation connected to the Merger Agreement may result in significant costs of defense, indemnification, and liability. In connection with the Merger Agreement, purported stockholders of the Company have filed three complaints against the Company, alleging violations of Sections 14(d), 14(e) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. These complaints seek, among other things, (i) injunctive relief to prevent the consummation of the merger, (ii) a rescission of the merger if the merger closes or (iii) in the alternative, an award of rescissory damages. While the outcome of these lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes they are without merit. However, regardless of the outcome of these complaints or any other future litigation which may arise related to the Merger Agreement and the transactions it contemplates, such litigation may be time-consuming and expensive and may distract our management from running the day-to-day operations of our business. More information regarding the three existing complaints is set forth in further detail in Amendment No. 2 and Amendment No. 3 to the Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company with the SEC on December 29, 2020 and January 11, 2021, respectively.\nThe Merger Agreement imposes restrictions on the operation of our business prior to closing, which could adversely affect our business. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses, including by delaying or preventing the Company from pursuing non-ordinary course opportunities that may arise or precluding actions that may be advisable if the Company were to remain an independent public company.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a third party from acquiring us prior to the completion of the tender offer and the merger. The Merger Agreement contains provisions that restrict our ability to solicit a third-party proposal for an acquisition of the Company. These provisions include the general prohibition on our soliciting or initiating discussions with third parties regarding any alternative acquisition proposal, and the requirement that we pay a termination fee of $29,000,000 to Parent if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances. These provisions might discourage an otherwise-interested third party from proposing an acquisition of the Company. Furthermore, even if a third party elects to propose an acquisition, the prospect of a termination fee may result in that third party\u2019s offering a lower value to our stockholders than such third party might otherwise have offered.\nIf the tender offer and the merger are completed, our current stockholders will forego any future increase in our value. Our stockholders will be prevented from participating in our potential future earnings and growth or benefit from any potential future increase in our value following the tender offer and the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nOur executive officers and directors may have interests that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally. Our executive officers and directors may have interests in the tender offer and merger that are different from, or are in addition to, those of our stockholders generally. These interests include direct or indirect ownership of our common stock and stock options, the acceleration of stock options upon consummation of the transactions and other interests. Such interests of our directors and executive officers are set forth in further detail in the Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company with the SEC on December 18, 2020.\nRisks Related to Our Finances and Capital Structure\nThere are risks associated with the Company\u2019s debt structure. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $277.0 million of consolidated indebtedness. The Company\u2019s ability to meet its debt service obligations, comply with its financial and restrictive covenants under its debt instruments and refinance its indebtedness is dependent upon its ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales, and its ability to access the capital markets, each of which are subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, seasonality and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond its control. The Company\u2019s debt levels and the terms of its indebtedness may limit its liquidity and flexibility in obtaining additional financing and pursuing other business opportunities. If the Company is unable to repay or refinance its debt as it becomes due, it may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions, including undertaking alternative financing plans, which may have onerous terms or may be unavailable, reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes or dedicating an unsustainable level of its cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness. In addition, the failure of the Company to comply with the financial or restrictive covenants contained in its debt instruments could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived could accelerate the Company's debt repayment obligations.\nThe Company may undertake one or more significant corporate transactions that may not achieve their intended results, produce less than expected returns, may be dilutive to existing businesses, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and its results of operations, and may result in additional risks to its businesses. The Company continuously evaluates the acquisition and disposition of operating businesses and assets and may in the future undertake significant transactions. Any such transaction could be material to the Company\u2019s business and could take any number of forms, including mergers, joint ventures, investments in new lines of business and the purchase of equity interests or assets. The form of consideration associated with such transactions may include, among other things, cash, common stock, equity interests or loans payable to the Company and its affiliates by the purchaser. The Company also regularly evaluates the merits\nof disposing its operating businesses and assets, in whole or in part, which could take the form of asset sales, mergers or sales of equity interests in its subsidiaries (privately or through a public offering), or the spin-off of equity interests of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries to its stockholders.\nThese types of significant transactions may present significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed, potential loss of significant revenue and income streams, unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, potential acceleration of taxes currently deferred, regulatory or compliance issues, the triggering of certain covenants in the Company\u2019s debt instruments (including accelerated repayment) and other unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. As a result of the risks inherent in such transactions, the Company cannot guarantee that any such transaction will ultimately result in the realization of the anticipated benefits of the transaction or that significant transactions will not have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition or its results of operations. If the Company were to complete such an acquisition, disposition, investment or other strategic transaction, it may require additional debt or equity financing that could result in a significant increase in its amount of debt or the number of outstanding shares of its Common Stock.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to access capital markets could be limited. From time to time, the Company may need to access the capital markets to obtain long-term and short-term financing. However, the Company\u2019s ability to access the capital markets for long-term financing could be limited by among other things, its existing capital structure, including its current level of indebtedness, its credit ratings and its financial results. In addition, volatility and weakness in capital markets may adversely affect the Company\u2019s credit availability and related financing costs. Capital markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption. If the disruption in these markets is prolonged, the Company\u2019s ability to obtain new credit or refinance obligations as they become due, on acceptable terms, if at all, could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the trading markets for the Company's securities rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about the Company and the marine transportation industry. If one or more analysts downgrade or provide negative outlook on the Company's securities or the marine transportation industry or the securities of any of the Company's competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about the Company's business, the price of the Company's securities could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the Company's business or fails to publish reports on the Company regularly, the Company could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause the price or trading volume of its securities to decline.\nThere can be no assurance that such markets will be a reliable source of financing for the Company, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and its ability to service its debts.\nThe Company engages in hedging activities, which expose it to risks. The Company has in the past and may in the future use futures and swaps to hedge risks, such as escalation in fuel costs and movements in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. However, hedging activities can result in losses when a position is purchased in a declining market or a position is sold in a rising market. Such purchases expose the Company to risks of meeting margin calls and drawing on its capital, counterparty risk due to failure of an exchange or institution with which it has entered into a swap, incurring higher costs than competitors or similar businesses that do not engage in such strategies, and losses on its investment portfolio. Such strategies can also cause earnings to be volatile, and the current volatility in the financial markets exacerbates these risks. If the Company fails to offset such volatility, its results of operations, cash flows and financial position may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to certain foreign currency, interest rate, fixed-income, equity and commodity price risks. The Company is exposed to certain foreign currency, interest rate, fixed-income, equity and commodity price risks. Although some of these risks may be hedged, fluctuations could impact the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For instance, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar results in higher prices for U.S. exports, which may adversely affect Inland Services and Ocean Services\u2019 operating results. The Company has, and anticipates that it will continue to have, contracts denominated in foreign currencies. It is often not practicable for the Company to effectively hedge the entire risk of significant changes in currency rates. The Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows have been negatively impacted for certain periods and positively impacted for other periods, and may continue to be affected to a material extent by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows may also be affected by the cost of hedging activities that the Company undertakes. The Company holds a portion of its net assets in cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities. Such investments subject the Company to risks generally inherent in the capital markets. Volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty also increase the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on the Company\u2019s marketable securities could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them. In addition, rising interest rates could increase the Company\u2019s cost of capital, which may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nInland Services could experience variation in freight rates. Freight transportation rates may fluctuate as the volume of cargo and availability of barges change. The volume of freight transported on inland waterways may vary as a result of various factors, such as global economic conditions and business cycles, domestic and international agricultural production and demand, and foreign currency exchange rates. Barge participation in the industry can also vary year-to-year and is dependent on the number of barges built and retired from service. Extended periods of high barge availability and low cargo demand could adversely impact Inland Services.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and Related Ownership Limitations\nIf the Company does not restrict the amount of ownership of its Common Stock by non-U.S. citizens, it could be prohibited from operating inland river vessels and barges and tankers in the United States, which would adversely impact its business and operating results. The Company is subject to the Jones Act, which governs, among other things, the ownership and operation of vessels used to carry cargo between U.S. ports. Subject to limited exceptions, the Jones Act requires that vessels engaged in the U.S. coastwise trade be built in the United States, registered under the U.S.-flag and manned by predominantly U.S. crews. The Jones Act also requires that vessels engaged in coastwise trade be owned and operated by \u201cU.S. citizens\u201d within the meaning of the Jones Act. Compliance with the Jones Act requires that non-U.S. citizens own no more than 25% of the entities that directly or indirectly own or operate the vessels that the Company operates in the U.S. coastwise trade. Although SEACOR\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws contain provisions intended to assure compliance with these provisions of the Jones Act, a failure to maintain compliance by the Company or any of the entities that directly or indirectly own its vessels would adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and could temporarily or permanently prohibit the Company from operating vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade. In addition, the Company could be subject to fines and its vessels could be subject to seizure and forfeiture for violations of the Jones Act and the related U.S. vessel documentation laws.\nThe restrictions in SEACOR\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws limiting the ownership of Common Stock by individuals and entities that are not U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act may affect the liquidity of SEACOR\u2019s Common Stock and may result in non-U.S. citizens being required to sell their shares at a loss or relinquish their voting, dividend and distribution rights. Under the Jones Act, at least 75% of the outstanding shares of each class or series of SEACOR\u2019s capital stock must be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act. Certain provisions of SEACOR\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws are intended to facilitate compliance with this requirement and may have an adverse effect on holders of shares of the Common Stock. In addition, the indentures governing the Company\u2019s 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes and 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes include provisions that are designed to ensure compliance with the Jones Act.\nUnder the provisions of SEACOR\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, the aggregate percentage of ownership by non-U.S. citizens of any class of SEACOR\u2019s capital stock (including Common Stock) is limited to 22.5% of the outstanding shares of each such class to ensure that such ownership by non-U.S. citizens will not exceed the maximum percentage permitted by the Jones Act, which is presently 25%. The Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws authorizes SEACOR\u2019s Board of Directors, under certain circumstances, to increase the foregoing permitted percentage to no more than 24%. The Restated Certificate of Incorporation further provides that any issuance or transfer of shares to non-U.S. citizens in excess of such permitted percentage shall be ineffective as against the Company and that neither the Company nor its transfer agent shall register such purported issuance or transfer of shares to non-U.S. citizens or be required to recognize the purported transferee or owner as a stockholder of the Company for any purpose whatsoever except to exercise the Company\u2019s remedies. Any such excess shares in the hands of a non-U.S. citizen shall not have any voting or dividend rights and are subject to redemption by the Company in its discretion. The liquidity or market value of the shares of Common Stock may be adversely impacted by such transfer restrictions.\nAs a result of the above provisions, a proposed transferee of the Common Stock that is a non-U.S. citizen may not receive any return on its investment in shares it purportedly purchases or owns, and it may sustain a loss. The Company, in its discretion, is entitled to redeem all or any portion of such shares most recently acquired (as determined by its Board of Directors in accordance with guidelines that are set forth in SEACOR\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation) by non-U.S. citizens in excess of such maximum permitted percentage for such class or series at a redemption price based on a fair market value formula that is set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which may be paid in cash or promissory notes at the discretion of the Company. Such excess shares shall also not be accorded any voting, dividend or distribution rights until they have ceased to be excess shares, provided that they have not been already redeemed by the Company. As a result of these provisions, a purported stockholder who is not a U.S. citizen within the meaning of the Jones Act may be required to sell its shares of Common Stock at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on its investment in such shares. Further, the Company may have to incur additional indebtedness, or use available cash (if any), to fund all or a portion of such redemption, in which case the Company\u2019s financial condition may be materially weakened.\nSo that the Company may ensure its compliance with the Jones Act, SEACOR\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws permit it to require that owners of any shares of its capital stock provide confirmation of their citizenship. In the event that a person does not submit such documentation to the Company, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws provide the Company with certain remedies, including the suspension of the payment of dividends and distributions with respect to those shares and deposit of any such dividends and distributions into an escrow account. As a result of non-compliance with these provisions, an owner of the shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock may lose significant rights associated with those shares.\nIn addition to the risks described above, the foregoing foreign ownership restrictions could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for SEACOR\u2019s Common Stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the SEACOR\u2019s stockholders.\nIf non-U.S. citizens own more than 22.5% of SEACOR\u2019s Common Stock, the Company may not have the funds or the ability to redeem any excess shares and it could be forced to suspend its operations in the U.S. coastwise trade. SEACOR\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws contain provisions prohibiting ownership of its Common Stock by persons who are not U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act, in the aggregate, in excess of 22.5% of such shares in order to ensure that such ownership by non-U.S. citizens will not exceed the maximum percentage permitted by the Jones Act, which is presently 25%. The Restated Certificate of Incorporation permits the Company to redeem such excess shares, including those shares issued upon conversion or exchange of the Company\u2019s convertible notes. The per share redemption price may be paid, as determined by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, by cash or promissory notes. However, the Company may not be able to redeem such excess shares for cash because its operations may not have generated sufficient excess cash flow to fund such redemption. If, for any reason, the Company is unable to effect such a redemption when such ownership of shares by non-U.S. citizens is in excess of 25% of the Common Stock, or otherwise prevent non-U.S. citizens in the aggregate from owning shares in excess of 25% of any such class or series of the Company\u2019s capital stock, or fail to exercise its redemption rights because it is unaware that such ownership exceeds such percentage, the Company will likely be unable to comply with the Jones Act and will likely be required by the applicable governmental authorities to suspend its operations in the U.S. coastwise trade. Any such actions by governmental authorities would have a severely detrimental impact on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nSignificant exercises of stock options or conversion of convertible debt could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 20,472,853 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding; however, the total number of shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock issued and outstanding does not include shares reserved for issuance under the Company\u2019s stock plans, including upon the exercise of options issued under such plans, or shares issuable upon the conversion of the Company\u2019s convertible debt. The exercise of outstanding options, the issuance of shares reserved for issuance under the Company\u2019s Stock Plans and the conversion of convertible debt instruments could adversely affect the price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, will reduce the percentage of Common Stock held by the Company\u2019s current stockholders and may cause its current stockholders to suffer significant dilution, which may adversely affect the market for the Company\u2019s Common Stock. In addition, the Company may determine to issue additional shares of Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable for Common Stock, which could have a similar result.\nThe Company\u2019s business and stock price may be materially adversely affected if its internal control over financial reporting is not effective. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules promulgated by the SEC, companies are required to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting. As part of this process, the Company is required to document and test its internal control over financial reporting; management is required to assess and issue a report concerning the Company's internal control over financial reporting; and the Company's independent registered certified public accounting firm is required to attest on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. In the past, the Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. While all such identified material weaknesses have been remediated, there can be no assurance that the Company will not identify material weaknesses in its internal control in the future. Moreover, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in the Company\u2019s financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, which could cause the Company to fail to meet its reporting obligations, lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of the Company\u2019s securities.\nRisks Related to Legal, Tax and Regulatory Matters\nChanges in U.S. policies governing foreign trade, international travel, immigration, manufacturing and foreign investment could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, travel to and from the United States, immigration, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries in which the Company operates, and any negative sentiments towards the United States as a result of such changes, could adversely affect the domestic and global transportation services industry, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nAdverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the Company. The Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to, a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of its business. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Irrespective of its merits, litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and may cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention. If the Company suffers an adverse judgment, it may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against it that could materially adversely affect a portion of its business operations or materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s activities outside of the United States subjects it to risks associated with international operations. The Company operates vessels and transacts other business worldwide. Its ability to compete in international markets may be adversely affected by foreign government regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local competitors, or that require foreign persons to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. Further, the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries may face governmentally imposed restrictions on their ability to transfer funds to their parent company.\nActivity outside the United States involves additional risks, including the possibility of:\n\u2022embargoes or restrictive actions by the United States and/or foreign governments that could limit the Company\u2019s ability to provide services in foreign countries or cause retaliatory actions by such governments;\n\u2022a change in, or the imposition of, withholding or other taxes on foreign income, tariffs or restrictions on foreign trade and investment;\n\u2022limitations on the repatriation of earnings or currency exchange controls and import/export quotas;\n\u2022unwaivable, burdensome local cabotage and local ownership laws and requirements;\n\u2022nationalization, expropriation, asset seizure, blockades and blacklisting;\n\u2022limitations in the availability, amount or terms of insurance coverage;\n\u2022loss of contract rights and inability to enforce contracts;\n\u2022longer payment cycles and problems collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022political instability, war and civil disturbances or other risks that may limit or disrupt markets, such as terrorist acts, piracy, and kidnapping;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange that affect demand for the Company\u2019s services and its profitability;\n\u2022potential noncompliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010;\n\u2022labor strikes;\n\u2022import or export quotas and other forms of public and government regulation;\n\u2022changes in general economic and political conditions; and\n\u2022difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations.\nIn June 2016, voters in the U.K. approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the European Union (\"E.U.\"), commonly referred to as \"Brexit\". On January 31, 2020, the U.K. formally left the E.U. and on December 24, 2020 the U.K. and E.U. agreed to a trade deal (the \u201cTrade and Cooperation Agreement\u201d) which was ratified by the U.K. on December 30, 2020. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement is subject to formal approval by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union before it comes into effect and has been applied provisionally since January 1, 2021. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement allows the U.K and E.U. to continue trading without tariffs or quotas, however, the movement of goods between the U.K. and the remaining member states of the E.U. may be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks, leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure. In addition, there are still a number of areas of uncertainty in connection with the future of the U.K. and its relationship with the E.U. and the application and interpretation of the Trade and\nCooperation Agreement, and Brexit-related matters may take several years to be clarified and resolved. In particular, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement only covers the trade of goods and, therefore, uncertainly remains over the UK\u2019s long-term trading of services relationship with the E.U.\nAt this time, we cannot predict the potential impact of Brexit on our business, if any. Brexit also may create global economic uncertainty, which may cause the Company\u2019s customers and potential customers to monitor their costs and reduce their budgets for the Company\u2019s services. Any of these effects, and others the Company cannot anticipate, could materially adversely affect its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf there is a determination that the Spin-off was taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings underlying the tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, then the Company and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. The Spin-Off was conditioned upon the Company\u2019s receipt of an opinion of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP, counsel to the Company, substantially to the effect that the separation qualified as a transaction that is described in Section 355 of the Code. The opinion relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from the Company and SEACOR Marine regarding the past and future conduct of each of the company\u2019s respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were incorrect, the Company and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of the Company or SEACOR Marine after the separation. If the separation is determined to be taxable, the Company and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\nPrior to the Spin-Off, the Company and SEACOR Marine entered into a tax matters agreement (the \u201cSMHI Tax Matters Agreement\u201d) that governs the parties\u2019 respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes, tax attributes, the preparation and filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax proceedings and assistance and cooperation in respect of tax matters. Taxes relating to or arising out of the failure of the separation to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes are the responsibility of the Company, except, in general, if such failure is attributable to SEACOR Marine\u2019s actions or inactions.\nThe Company\u2019s obligations under the SMHI Tax Matters Agreement are not limited in amount or subject to any cap. Further, even if the Company is not responsible for its tax liabilities under the SMHI Tax Matters Agreement, the Company nonetheless could be liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities if SEACOR Marine were to fail to pay them. If the Company is required to pay any liabilities under the circumstances set forth in the SMHI Tax Matters Agreement or pursuant to applicable tax law, the amounts may be significant.\nThe Company could incur liability in connection with its provision of spill response services. On April 22, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon, a semi-submersible deepwater drilling rig operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, sank after an apparent blowout and fire resulting in a significant flow of hydrocarbons from the BP Macondo well (the \u201cDeepwater Horizon/BP Macondo Well Incident\u201d). The Company provided spill and emergency response services in connection with the Deepwater Horizon/BP Macondo Well Incident. O\u2019Brien\u2019s Response Management, L.L.C. (\u201cORM\u201d), a subsidiary of the Company, and National Response Corporation (\u201cNRC\u201d), which was a subsidiary of the Company at the time of the incident operating in the Company\u2019s now discontinued Environmental Services segment (the Company subsequently sold NRC to J.F. Lehman & Company (\u201cJFL\u201d)) are currently defendants in litigation arising from the Deepwater Horizon/BP Macondo Well Incident. Although companies are generally exempt in the United States from liability under the CWA for their own actions and omissions in providing spill response services, this exemption might not apply if a company were found to have been grossly negligent or to have engaged in willful misconduct, or if it were to have failed to provide these services consistent with the National Contingency Plan or as otherwise directed under the CWA. In addition, the exemption under the CWA would not protect a company against liability for personal injury or wrongful death claims, or against prosecution under other federal or state laws. All of the coastal states of the United States in which the Company provides services have adopted similar exemptions, but, several inland states have not. If a court or other applicable authority were to determine that the Company does not benefit from federal or state exemptions from liability in providing emergency response services, or if the other defenses asserted by the Company and its business segments are rejected, the Company could be liable together with the local contractor and the responsible party for any resulting damages, including damages caused by others, subject to the indemnification provisions and other liability terms and conditions negotiated with its domestic customers. In the international market, the Company does not benefit from the spill response liability protection provided by the CWA and, therefore, is subject to the liability terms and conditions negotiated with its international clients, in addition to any other defenses available to the Company and its business segments.\nIf Congress repeals the current $134.0 million cap for non-reclamation liabilities under OPA 90 or otherwise scales back the protections afforded to contractors thereunder, there may be increased exposure for remediation work and the cost for securing insurance for such work may become prohibitively expensive. Without affordable insurance and appropriate legislative regulation limiting liability, drilling, exploration, remediation and further investment in oil and gas exploration in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico may be discouraged and thus reduce the demand for the Company\u2019s services.\nThe Company could incur liability in connection with certain obligations relating to the Deepwater Horizon incident. In connection with the Deepwater Horizon/BP Macondo Well Incident, BP Exploration & Production, Inc. and BP America Production Company (collectively, the \u201cresponsible party\u201d) engaged the services of ORM and NRC. ORM and NRC were subsequently made defendants in litigation arising from the Deepwater Horizon/BP Macondo Well Incident. In connection with claims relating to clean-up operations following the Deepwater Horizon/BP Macondo Well Incident, the responsible party acknowledged and agreed to indemnify and defend ORM and NRC pursuant and subject to certain contractual agreements and potential limitations. No assurance can be given that the responsible party will honor its obligation to indemnify the Company under these arrangements. If the responsible party were to fail to honor its obligations, the Company may be faced with significant monetary payments that could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Part IV \"Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nThe Company\u2019s U.S-flag vessels are subject to requisition for ownership or use by the United States in case of national emergency or national defense need and certain of the Company\u2019s vessels participate in the MSP. The Merchant Marine Act of 1936 provides that, during a national emergency declared by Presidential proclamation or a period for which the President has proclaimed that the security of the national defense makes it advisable, the Secretary of Transportation may requisition the ownership or use of any vessel owned by U.S. citizens (which includes the Company) and any vessel under construction in the United States. If any of the Company\u2019s vessels were purchased or chartered by the federal government under this law, the Company would be entitled to just compensation, which is generally the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or, in the case of a charter, the fair market value of charter hire, but the Company would not be entitled to compensation for any consequential damages. In addition, the Company operates vessels that participate in the MSP, which ensures that militarily useful U.S.-flag vessels are available to the U.S. Department of Defense in the event of war or national emergency. The purchase, charter or use for an extended period of time by the federal government of one or more of the Company\u2019s vessels under these laws or programs could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRepeal, Amendment, Suspension or Non-Enforcement of the Jones Act would result in additional competition for Ocean Services and Inland Services and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. A substantial portion of the operations of Ocean Services and Inland Services are conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade and thus subject to the provisions of the Jones Act. For years there have been attempts to repeal or amend such provisions, and such attempts are expected to continue in the future.\nUnder certain conditions, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security can grant waivers of the Jones Act to foreign vessel operators. Thus far, the Secretary has granted waivers only for relatively short periods in connection with natural disasters and the transportation of petroleum released from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Nonetheless, future waivers, particularly if for longer periods, could result in increased competition, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s Jones Act operations.\nRepeal, substantial amendment or waiver of provisions of the Jones Act could significantly adversely affect the Company by, among other things, resulting in additional competition from competitors with lower operating costs, because of their ability to use vessels built in lower-cost foreign shipyards, owned and manned by foreign nationals with promotional foreign tax incentives and with lower wages and benefits than U.S. citizens. In addition, the Company\u2019s advantage as a U.S.-citizen operator of Jones Act vessels could be eroded by periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act. If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, or other prevailing trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of maritime cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flag or foreign-built vessels. Such a change could significantly increase competition in the U.S. coastwise trade, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRestrictions on non-U.S. citizen ownership of the Company\u2019s vessels could limit its ability to sell off any portion of its business or result in the forfeiture of its vessels. As noted above, compliance with the Jones Act requires that non-U.S. citizens own no more than 25% in the entities that directly or indirectly own or operate the vessels that the Company operates in the U.S. coastwise trade. If the Company were to seek to sell any portion of its business that owns any of these vessels, it would have fewer potential purchasers, since some potential purchasers might be unable or unwilling to satisfy the U.S. citizenship restrictions described above. As a result, the sales price for that portion of the Company\u2019s business may not attain the amount that could be obtained in an unconstrained sale.\nThe Company is subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. Regulation of the shipping industry has intensified over the past several decades, and the Company expects this trend to continue. Increasingly stringent federal, state, local and international laws and regulations governing worker safety and health and the manning, construction and operation of vessels significantly affect the Company\u2019s operations. Many aspects of the marine industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation and oversight, including by the USCG, OSHA, NTSB, CBP, EPA, IMO, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Maritime Administration, state environmental protection agencies for those jurisdictions in which the Company operates, and to regulation by states, port authorities and classification societies (such as the American Bureau of Shipping). The Company is also subject to regulation under international treaties, such as SOLAS, MARPOL, and the STCW. These agencies, organizations, regulations and treaties establish safety requirements and standards and are authorized to investigate vessels and accidents and to recommend improved safety standards. The CBP and USCG are authorized to inspect vessels at will. The Company has and will continue to spend significant funds to comply with these regulations and treaties. Failure to comply with these regulations and treaties may cause the Company to incur significant liabilities or restrictions on its operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s business and operations are also subject to federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational safety and health, including laws that that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into waters restricted thereunder. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal penalties, fines, injunctions, or other sanctions, or the suspension or termination of the Company\u2019s operations. Compliance with such laws and regulations frequently requires installation of costly equipment, increased staffing, increased fuel costs, specific training, or operational changes, and the phase-out of certain vessels. Some environmental laws impose strict and, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous materials and damage to natural resources, which could subject the Company to liability without regard to whether it was negligent or at fault. Under OPA 90, owners, operators and bareboat charterers are jointly and severally strictly liable for the removal costs and damages resulting from the discharge of oil within the navigable waters of the United States and the EEZ around the United States. In addition, an oil spill could result in significant liability, including fines, penalties, criminal liability and costs for natural resource and other damages under other federal and state laws and civil actions. Liability for a catastrophic spill could exceed the Company\u2019s available insurance coverage and result in it having to liquidate assets to pay claims. These laws and regulations may expose the Company to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, including charterers. Because such laws and regulations frequently change and may impose increasingly strict requirements, the Company cannot predict the ongoing cost of complying with these laws and regulations. Moreover, the lack of uniformity of environmental regulations imposed by different agencies increases the Company's compliance costs and risk of non-compliance.\nIn recent years, governments and supranational groups have regulated vessel fuel and air emissions, including requirements to use low sulfur fuels, which have increased the Company's operating costs. Other new environmental or emissions control laws or regulations may similarly require an increase in the Company's operating costs and/or in the Company's capital spending for additional equipment or personnel to comply with such requirements and could also result in a reduction in revenues due to downtime required for the installation of such equipment.\nThe Company cannot be certain that existing laws, regulations or standards, as interpreted now or in the future, or future laws, regulations and standards will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Regulation of the shipping industry will likely continue to become more stringent and more expensive for the Company. In addition, a serious marine incident that results in significant oil pollution could result in additional regulation and lead to strict governmental enforcement or other legal challenges. The variability and uncertainty of current and future shipping regulations could hamper the ability of the Company and its customers to plan for the future or establish long-term strategies. Additional environmental and other requirements, as well as more stringent enforcement policies, may be adopted that could limit the Company\u2019s ability to operate, require the Company to incur substantial additional costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition. For more information, see \u201cItem 1. Government Regulation - Environmental Compliance.\u201d\nThe Company is required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain, maintain and periodically renew certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to its operations or vessels. In certain instances, the failure to obtain, maintain or renew these authorizations could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThere are risks associated with climate change, as well as climate change legislation and regulations. The physical risks of climate change, such as more frequent or more extreme weather events, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, changes in river flow patterns and other related phenomena, could affect some, or all, of the Company\u2019s operations. Severe weather or other natural disasters could be destructive to the Company\u2019s operations and the operations of its customers. Weather patterns, such as excessive rainfall or drought, can affect river levels and cause ice conditions during winter months, which can hamper barge navigation. Locks and dams on river systems may be closed for maintenance or other causes, which may delay barge movements. These conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGovernments and supranational groups and various other parties around the world have, in recent years, proposed or adopted new laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use that in turn could result in a reduction in use of hydrocarbon-based fuel. A number of countries and organizations have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory measures or international treaties may include, among others, adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy and could include specific restrictions on shipping emissions. In 2015, various countries adopted the Paris Agreement, which seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to slow global warming. While the U.S. signed the Paris Agreement in 2016it formally withdrew from the agreement in 2020. In January 2021, the President issued an executive order announcing that the U.S. will be rejoining the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement does not specifically mention shipping. Additionally, some institutional investors and groups have indicated a focus on matters affecting the environment, which may result in reduced investments in, or financing available to, industries that emit greenhouse gases. Many of these groups have developed environmental, social and governance standards as benchmarks. The Company's failure to meet these evolving standards or benchmarks could adversely impact its business, stock price or access to capital.\nGovernments could also pass laws or regulations encouraging or mandating the use of alternative energy sources such as wind power and solar energy. These requirements could reduce demand for traditional energy commodities and therefore impact services provided by the Company. Such initiatives could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nA violation of the FCPA may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and operations. In order to effectively compete in certain foreign jurisdictions, the Company seeks to establish joint ventures with local operators or strategic partners. As a U.S. corporation, the Company is subject to the regulations imposed by the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining business. The Company has adopted stringent procedures to enforce compliance with the FCPA. Nevertheless, the Company does business and may do additional business in the future in countries and regions where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may not be customary and it may be held liable for actions taken by its strategic or local partners even though these partners may not be subject to the FCPA. The Company\u2019s personnel and intermediaries, including its local operators and strategic partners, may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by government officials, political parties and officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, or private entities in the countries in which the Company operates or may operate in the future. As a result, the Company faces the risk that an unauthorized payment or offer of payment could be made by one of its employees or intermediaries, even if such parties are not always subject to the Company\u2019s control or are not themselves subject to the FCPA or other similar laws to which the Company may be subject, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. Any allegation or determination that the Company has violated the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased security and inspection procedures and tighter import and export controls could increase costs and disrupt the Company\u2019s business. Maritime shipping is subject to various security and customs inspections and related procedures in countries of origin and destination. Applicable inspection procedures can result in the seizure of contents of the Company\u2019s vessels, delays in delivering cargoes, and the levying of customs payments, duties, fines and other penalties. The U.S. government, foreign governments, international organizations, and industry associations have from time-to-time considered ways to expand inspection procedures. Such changes, if implemented, could impose additional financial and legal obligations on the Company, including additional responsibility for physically inspecting the contents of cargoes it is shipping. Furthermore, changes to inspection procedures could also impose additional costs and obligations on the Company\u2019s customers and may, in certain cases, render the shipment of certain types of cargo impractical. Any such changes or developments may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nDifficult economic conditions, including those caused by natural disasters, terrorist attacks, the widespread outbreak of an illness or other heath issue, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other extraordinary events, could materially adversely affect the Company. The success of the Company\u2019s business is both directly and indirectly dependent upon conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world that are outside its control and difficult to predict. Factors such as commodity prices, interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, availability and cost of labor, changes in laws or regulations affecting our business, changes in tax laws, including increases in corporate tax rates in the U.S. or abroad, elimination or imposition of trade barriers and protective rules, currency exchange rates and controls, pandemic disease or other health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts or security operations) can have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s business and investments, which could reduce its revenues and profitability. Uncertainty about global economic conditions may lead or require businesses to postpone capital spending in response to tighter credit and reductions in income or asset values and to cancel or renegotiate existing contracts because their access to capital is impeded. This would in turn affect the Company\u2019s profitability or results of operations. These factors may also adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of the Company\u2019s customers. Volatility in the conditions of the global economic\nmarkets can also affect the Company\u2019s ability to raise capital at attractive prices. The Company\u2019s ongoing exposure to credit risks on its accounts receivable balances are heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company has procedures that are designed to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its receivables; however, there can be no assurance that such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Unstable economic conditions may also increase the volatility of the Company\u2019s stock price.\nIn addition, public health threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time-to-time occurred in various parts of the world in which the Company or its vendors, including its shipbuilders, operate could adversely impact the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and delivery schedule of new equipment.\nInvestment in new business strategies and initiatives present risks not originally contemplated. The Company has invested, and in the future may again invest, in new business plans or acquisitions, some of which may not be directly linked to existing business lines or activities. These activities may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the plans or acquisitions, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. To the extent such investments are not directly linked to existing business lines or activities, such investments may expose the Company to unforeseen risks. These investments may take the form of securities or other assets that are not very liquid. As a result of the risks inherent in new ventures, there can be no assurance that any such venture will be successful, or that new ventures will not have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect it from the liabilities that could arise in its businesses. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage against the risks related to its businesses, risks may arise for which the Company is not insured. Claims covered by insurance are subject to deductibles, the aggregate amount of which could be material and may be subject to caps on insurance payments. Insurance policies are also subject to compliance with certain conditions, the failure of which could lead to a denial of coverage as to a particular claim or the voiding of a particular insurance policy. There also can be no assurance that existing insurance coverage can be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or that available coverage will be adequate to cover future claims. If a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured, the Company could be exposed to substantial liability. Further, to the extent the proceeds from insurance are not sufficient to repair or replace a damaged asset, the Company would be required to expend funds to supplement the insurance and in certain circumstances may decide that such expenditures are not justified, which, in either case, could adversely affect its liquidity and ability to grow.\nNegative publicity may adversely impact the Company. Media coverage and public statements that insinuate improper actions by the Company or senior executives, regardless of their factual accuracy or truthfulness, may result in negative publicity, litigation or governmental investigations by regulators. Similar events impacting other vessel operators could indirectly harm the Company by causing substantial adverse publicity affecting the marine transportation industry in general. Addressing negative publicity and any resulting litigation or investigations may distract management, increase costs, impede hiring and divert resources. Negative publicity may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s reputation and the morale of its employees, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to attract and retain qualified personnel and crew its vessels could have an adverse effect on its business and is also dependent on unionized employees. Attracting and retaining skilled personnel across all of the Company\u2019s business segments is an important factor in its future success. In addition, the success of the Company is dependent upon its ability to crew its vessels. The market for qualified personnel is highly competitive and the Company cannot be certain that it will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel and crewing its vessels in the future. Approximately 800 of the Company\u2019s employees, out of a total of approximately 2,200 employees as of December 31, 2020, are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. The Company could be adversely affected if it is unable to successfully negotiate and maintain collective bargaining agreements with these unionized employees.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on key members of its management, the loss of whom could disrupt its business operations. The Company depends to a large extent on the efforts and continued employment of its executive officers and key management personnel. The Company does not maintain key-man insurance. The loss of services of one or more of the Company\u2019s executive officers or key management personnel could have a negative impact on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company relies on information technology, and if it is unable to protect against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, its operations could be disrupted and its business could be negatively affected. The Company relies on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information; to capture knowledge of its business; to coordinate its business across its operation bases; and to communicate within the Company and with customers, suppliers, partners and other third-parties. These information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns,\nhardware or software failures, cyber-attacks, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. The Company\u2019s technology systems are also subject to cybersecurity attacks including malware, other malicious software, phishing email attacks, attempts to gain unauthorized access to its data, the unauthorized release, corruption or loss of its data, loss or damage to its data delivery systems, and other electronic security breaches. If the Company\u2019s information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and its business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, the Company\u2019s operations could be disrupted and its business could be negatively affected. In addition, cyber-attacks could lead to potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, data loss or data corruption impacting proprietary data of the Company or its customers. The frequency and sophistication of these attacks has grown significantly in recent years with, in some cases, the attacks conducted or sponsored by nation states, including the recent attack on Solar Winds. The Company\u2019s information technology systems are becoming increasingly integrated, so damage, disruption or shutdown to the system could result in a more widespread impact.\nIn addition, regulatory or legislative action related to cybersecurity, privacy, and data protection worldwide may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products or services. The E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which became effective in May 2018, applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to E.U. customers. The GDPR established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to 4 percent of total company revenue). GDPR requirements that must be complied with when handling the personal data of E.U.-based data subjects include: providing expanded disclosures about how personal data will be used; higher standards for organizations to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent or have another legal basis in place to justify their data processing activities; the obligation to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; new rights for individuals to be \u201cforgotten\u201d and rights to data portability, as well as enhanced current rights; the principal of accountability and demonstrating compliance through policies, procedures, training and audit; the new mandatory data breach regime. As the E.U. member states continue to reframe their national legislation to harmonize with the GDPR, we will need to monitor compliance with all relevant E.U. member states\u2019 laws and regulations, including where permitted derogations from the GDPR are introduced.\nOther governmental authorities around the world have passed or are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. Recent action by the IMO\u2019s Maritime Safety Committee and United States agencies indicate that cybersecurity regulations for the maritime industry are likely to be further developed in the near future in an attempt to combat cybersecurity threats. The Company expects cybersecurity regulations to continue to evolve and be costly to implement. If it violates or fails to comply with such regulatory or legislative requirements, it could be fined or otherwise sanctioned, and such fines or penalties could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and operations.\nInland Services\u2019 results of operations could be adversely affected by international economic and political factors. The actions of the United States and foreign governments could affect the import and export of the dry bulk commodities typically transported by Inland Services. Foreign trade agreements and each country\u2019s adherence to the terms of such agreements can raise or lower demand for U.S. imports and exports of the dry bulk commodities that Inland Services transports. National and international boycotts and embargoes of other countries or U.S. imports or exports together with the raising or lowering of tariff rates could affect the demand for the transportation of cargoes handled by Inland Services.", "PERMNO": 78137, "SIC": 4412, "TIC": "CKH"}
