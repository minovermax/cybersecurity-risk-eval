You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this report, including the consolidated audited financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this annual report on Form 10-K, with respect to any investment in shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of the date of this report (unless another date is indicated) and we undertake no obligation to update or revise the statements in light of future development.\nRisks Related to our Business\nThere is no guarantee that cash flow from operations and/or debt and equity financings will provide sufficient capital to meet our expansion goals and working capital needs.\nOur current strategic plan includes the expansion of our company both organically and through acquisitions if market conditions and competitive conditions allow. Due to the long-term nature of investments in acquisitions and other financial needs to support organic growth, including working capital, we expect our long-term and working capital needs to periodically exceed the short-term fluctuations in cash flow from operations. We anticipate that we will likely raise additional external capital from the sale of common stock, preferred stock and debt instruments as market conditions may allow, in addition to cash flow from operations (which may not always be sufficient), to fund our growth and working capital needs.\nIn the event that we need to raise significant amounts of external capital at any time or over an extended period, we face a risk that we may need to do so under adverse capital market conditions with the result that our existing shareholders, as well as persons who acquire our common stock, may incur significant and immediate dilution should we raise capital from the sale of our common or preferred stock. Similarly, we may need to meet our external capital needs from the sale of secured or unsecured debt instruments at interest rates and with such other debt covenants and conditions as the market then requires. In all of these transactions we anticipate that we will likely need to raise significant amounts of additional external capital to support our growth. However, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise external capital on terms that are reasonable in light of current market conditions. In the event that we are not able to do so, those who acquire our common stock may face significant and immediate dilution and other adverse consequences. Further, debt covenants contained in debt instruments that we issue may limit our financial and operating flexibility with consequent adverse impact on our common stock market price.\nWe are substantially dependent upon the success and continued market acceptance of our technology; the absence of which may significantly reduce our sales, profits and cash flow and adversely impact our financial condition.\nIn addition to overall reduced market demand, other competing technologies may be offered by both existing competitors or by those that enter the market and these competing technologies may offer a better cost-benefit ratio than our products and/or at lower prices with the result that our sales, profits, and cash flow may suffer significantly over an extended period with serious adverse impact on our financial condition.\nOur future operating results depend in part on continued successful research, development and marketing of new and improved products and services through our subsidiary Cemtrex Advanced Technologies, and there can be no assurance that we will successfully introduce new products and services into the market.\nThe success of new and improved products and services through our Cemtrex Advanced Technologies Inc. subsidiary depends on our research and development efforts and the initial acceptance of our products by consumers. This is a new line of business for our company, and our management has limited experience with consumer products in general, and with IoT products in particular. Our business is affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research & development, production and/or marketing of new products and services due to lack of capital, which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market.\nOur failure to successfully develop, sell and market our new SmartDesk in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely affect our future profitability.\nWe believe that our profitability will depend in part on our ability to effectively (i) market and sell SmartDesk, (ii) continue our engineering effort to develop new features for the SmartDesk as requested by customers, (iii) market SmartDesk through our own marketing organization and via third-party distribution channels in the United States and internationally, and (iv) deliver SmartDesk to customers with appropriate installation and service. Failure to successfully execute these tasks in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely affect profitability. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts or that even when our SmartDesk is delivered, it will achieve market acceptance in a timely fashion. Further, there can be no assurance that expenses incurred in connection with the development, sales and marketing of SmartDesk will not exceed our expectations, or that SmartDesk will generate revenues sufficient to offset these expenses. In addition, although we have filed numerous U.S. patent applications relating to various aspects and features of our SmartDesk, there can be no assurance that any patents will issue on any of the pending patent applications.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from our universal shelf registration statement and may not use them effectively.\nWe intend to continue to allocate the net proceeds that we received from our registered shelf offering that went effective with the SEC on June 14, 2017 (i) to further the development, and sales and marketing of our new smart device, known as the SmartDesk, a proprietary advanced technology workspace solution developed entirely by our Advanced Technologies business segment, and (ii) for general corporate purposes, including for working capital purposes, to increase sales and operational capabilities in each of our market segments. The Company on an on-going basis invests its excess cash in large cap securities, both stocks and options, listed on major exchanges pending use of net proceeds for business matters. While these investments may prove to be lucrative to the company, these investments may prove to be disappointing and we could lose some or all of the net proceeds in this fashion. Our management will have broad discretion in the actual application of the net proceeds, and the failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk, market risk, and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company invests excess cash that the Company has on hand in large cap securities listed on major exchanges, including stocks and options. The Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nWe have substantial debt which could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund operations and prevent us from meeting our obligations under outstanding indebtedness.\nAs of September 30, 2020, our total indebtedness was approximately $19.4 million, including notes payable of $10.8 million, mortgage payable of $2.4 million, and bank loans of $6.2 million, including $3.5 million of PPP loans that the Company expects to be forgiven. Approximately $7 million of such debt is classified as current. This substantial debt could have important consequences, including the following: (i) a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations, future business opportunities and capital expenditures; (ii) our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, debt service requirements and general corporate purposes in the future may be limited; (iii) we may face a competitive disadvantage to lesser leveraged competitors; (iv) our debt service requirements could make it more difficult to satisfy other financial obligations; and (v) we may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business and we may be unable to carry out activities that are important to our growth.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, or to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond management\u2019s control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, which could impair our liquidity. Any refinancing of indebtedness, if available at all, could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations. Despite our significant amount of indebtedness, we may need to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial debt.\nOur ability to secure and maintain sufficient credit arrangements is key to our continued operations and there is no assurance we will be able to obtain sufficient additional equity or debt financing in the future.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to retain or renew our credit agreements and other finance agreements in the future. In the event our company grows rapidly, the uncertain economic climate continues, or we acquire one or more other companies, additional financing resources will likely be necessary in the current or future fiscal years. As a smaller public company with a limited ability to attract and obtain financing, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient additional equity or debt financing in the future on terms that are reasonable in light of current market conditions.\nWe are involved in an ongoing SEC investigation, which could divert management\u2019s focus, result in substantial investigation expenses and have an adverse impact on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company has received subpoenas from the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). The subpoenas request documents and information concerning, among other things, a company known as Telidyne Inc., a company controlled by our prior officer and director, Aron Govil, securities offerings related to Telidyne, and the Company\u2019s own product and services, business operations, securities\u2019 offerings and use of proceeds. Although the Company is not currently the subject of any enforcement proceedings, the investigation could lead to enforcement proceedings if the SEC contends that the Company has not complied with securities laws. The Company is fully cooperating with the SEC's requests. The Company has incurred legal expenses and may incur significant legal and accounting expenditures in connection with the SEC\u2019s investigation. The Company is unable to predict how long the SEC\u2019s investigation will continue or its outcome.\nOur sales and gross margins depend significantly on market demand for our products, as to which there can be no assurance.\nThe uncertainty in the United States and in the international economic and political environment could result in a decline in demand for our products in any industry. Our gross margins are dependent upon our ability to maintain sales volumes at levels that allow us to cover our fixed costs and variable costs per unit. To the extent that one or more product lines experience a significant and protracted decline in sales volume, we may experience significant declines in our gross margins that may result in losses. Further, any adverse changes in tax rates and laws affecting our customers could result in decreases in demand of our products and thus decrease our gross margins. Any of these factors could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn these circumstances, we anticipate that we could be required to increase or decrease staffing and more closely manage other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of our existing and future customers. Orders from our customers are subject to cancellation, and delivery schedules from our customers fluctuate as a result of changes in our customers\u2019 demand, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations, and may result in higher inventory levels. Higher inventory levels may cause us to need greater external financing, which adversely affects our financial performance.\nOur products face competitive challenges, including rapid technological changes, and pricing pressure from competitors, which could adversely affect our business.\nAll of our product lines are subject to significant competition from existing and future competitors, market conditions and technological change, or a combination of them, and our sales revenues and gross margins may suffer protracted and serious declines with the result that we would likely incur protracted losses. Further, the barriers to entry in several of our lines of business are not so significant that we may be facing competition from others who see significant opportunities to enter the market and undercut our prices with products that possess superior technological attributes at prices that offer our customers a better value. In this instance, we could incur protracted and significant losses and persons who acquire our common stock would suffer losses thereby.\nFactors affecting the industries that utilize our products could negatively impact our customers and us.\nWe have no real control over factors affecting the industries that utilize our products and to the extent that any one or more of these industries change dramatically, we may be facing significant financial challenges that are in excess of our existing capabilities. These factors include:\n\u25cf increased competition among our customers and their competitors;\n\u25cf the inability of our customers to develop and market their products;\n\u25cf recessionary periods in our customers\u2019 markets;\n\u25cf the potential that our customers\u2019 products become obsolete;\n\u25cf our customers\u2019 inability to react to rapidly changing technology; and\n\u25cf our customers\u2019 inability to pay for our products, which could, in turn, affect the company\u2019s results of operations.\nIf we are unable to develop new products, our competitors may develop and market products with better features that may reduce demand for our existing and potential products or otherwise result in our products becoming obsolete and could materially and adversely affect our ability to sustain profitability.\nThere are many larger competitors who compete directly with us and who have significantly greater financial, technological and research resources. This may serve to severely damage our ability to market and sell our products at price levels that would allow us to achieve and maintain profit margins and positive cash flow.\nWe are a smaller public company and we face rapid technological change in many of our product markets and we may not be able to introduce any successful new products or any enhancements to our existing products on a timely basis, or at all. This could result in prolonged and significant losses. In addition, our introduction of new products could adversely affect sales of certain of our existing products if these new products directly compete with our existing products. If our competitors develop innovative technologies that are superior to our products or if we fail to accurately anticipate market trends and respond on a timely basis with our own innovations, we may not achieve sufficient growth in its revenues to attain profitability or if we do, we may not be able sustain profitability.\nDeveloping and maintaining a patent portfolio is an expensive and time-consuming process and there is no assurance the Company will successfully develop patents to protect the intellectual property it is working on.\nIf we fail to establish, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights with respect to our technology, our financial condition, results of operations and business could be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to establish, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights with respect to our proprietary technologies, patents, patent applications, software and other rights will be a significant factor in determining our future financial and operating performance. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of patent, trade secret and copyright laws. We also use confidentiality and other provisions in our agreements that restrict access to and disclosure of our confidential know-how and trade secrets.\nWe have filed patent applications with respect to many aspects of our technologies. However, we cannot provide any assurances that any of these applications will ultimately result in issued patents or, if patents are issued, that they will provide sufficient protections for our technology against competitors. Although we have filed various patent applications for some of our core technologies, we currently hold only six issued patents, with two in the United States and four in Canada, and we may face delays and difficulties in obtaining our other filed patents, or we may not be able to obtain such patents at all.\nOutside of these patent applications, we seek to protect our technology as trade secrets and technical know-how. However, trade secrets and technical know-how are difficult to maintain and do not provide the same legal protections provided by patents. In particular, only patents will allow us to prohibit others from using independently developed technology that are similar. If competitors develop knowledge substantially equivalent or superior to our trade secrets and technical know-how, or gain access to our knowledge through other means such as observation of our technology that embodies trade secrets at customer sites which we do not control, the value of our trade secrets and technical know-how would be diminished.\nWhile we strive to maintain systems and procedures to protect the confidentiality and security of our trade secrets and technical know-how, these systems and procedures may fail to provide an adequate degree of protection. For example, although we generally enter into agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors, and strategic partners restricting the disclosure and use of trade secrets, technical know-how and confidential information , we cannot provide any assurance that these agreements will be sufficient to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure. In addition, some of the technology deployed at customer sites in the future , which we do not control, may be readily observable by third parties who are not under contractual obligations of non-disclosure, which may limit or compromise our ability to continue to protect such technology as a trade secret.\nMonitoring and policing unauthorized use and disclosure of intellectual property is difficult. If we learned that a third party was in fact infringing or otherwise violating our intellectual property, we may need to enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation. Litigation relating to our intellectual property may not prove successful and might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.\nFrom our customers\u2019 standpoint, the strength of the intellectual property under which we control can be a critical determinant of the value of our products and services. If we are unable to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property, it may become more difficult for us to attract new customers. Any such development could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not have sufficient financial resources to defend our intellectual property rights or otherwise successfully defend against claims that we have infringed on a third party\u2019s intellectual property and, as a result, it may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if such claims are not valid, they could subject us to significant costs. In addition, it may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation may also be necessary to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity by others. We may not have sufficient financial resources to defend our intellectual property rights or otherwise to successfully defend the company against valid or spurious claims that we have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of others. An adverse outcome in litigation or any similar proceedings could force us to take actions that could harm its business. These include: (i) ceasing to sell products that contain allegedly infringing property; (ii) obtaining licenses to the relevant intellectual property which we may not be able to obtain on terms that are acceptable, or at all; (iii) indemnifying certain customers or strategic partners if it is determined that we have infringed upon or misappropriated another party\u2019s intellectual property; and (iv) redesigning products that embody allegedly infringing intellectual property. Any of these results could adversely and significantly affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the cost of defending or asserting any intellectual property claim, both in legal fees and expenses, and the diversion of management resources, regardless of whether the claim is valid, could be significant and lead to significant and protracted losses.\nWe have grown through acquisitions and are continuously looking to fund other acquisitions; our failure to raise funds for acquisitions may have the effect of slowing down our growth and our use of funds for acquisitions subjects us to acquisition-related risks.\nWe intend to make acquisitions of complementary (including competitive) businesses, products and technologies. However, any future acquisitions may result in material transaction costs, increased interest and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, increased depreciation expense and increased operating expenses, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. Acquisitions will require integration of acquired assets and management into our operations to realize economies of scale and control costs. Acquisitions may involve other risks, including diversion of management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing internal development of our business and risks inherent in entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience. In connection with future acquisitions, we may make potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. In addition, consummation of acquisitions may subject us to unanticipated business uncertainties, contingent liabilities or legal matters relating to those acquired businesses for which the sellers of the acquired businesses may not fully indemnify us. There can be no assurance that our business will grow through acquisitions, as anticipated.\nThe loss of the services of Saagar Govil for any reason would materially and adversely affect our business operations and prospects.\nOur financial success is dependent to a significant degree upon the efforts of Saagar Govil, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Saagar Govil possesses engineering, sales and marketing experience concerning our company that our other officers do not have. We have not entered into an employment arrangement with Mr. Govil and we have not obtained key man insurance over him. There can be no assurance that Saagar Govil will continue to provide services to us. A voluntary or involuntary departure by Saagar Govil could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations if we were not able to attract a qualified replacement for them in a timely manner.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur management stockholders have significant stockholdings in and influence over our company which could make it impossible for public stockholders to influence the affairs of our company.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under Nasdaq Listing Rules. Approximately 90% of our outstanding voting shares, which includes our common stock, Series A preferred stock, Series C preferred stock and Series 1 preferred stock, are beneficially held by Aron Govil, our Founder, former officer and Director, and Saagar Govil, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Director. Pursuant to the certificate of designation for our Series A preferred stock, each outstanding share of Series A preferred stock is entitled to the number of votes equal to the result of (i) the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding at the time of such vote multiplied by 1.01, divided by (ii) the total number of shares of our Series A preferred stock outstanding at the time of such vote, at each meeting of stockholders of our company with respect to any and all matters presented to our stockholders for their action or consideration, including the election of directors. Pursuant to certificate of designation for our Series C preferred, each outstanding share of Series C Preferred Stock is entitled to the number of votes equal to the result of (i) the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the time of such vote multiplied by 10.01, and divided by (ii) the total number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock outstanding at the time of such vote, at each meeting of our shareholders with respect to any and all matters presented to our shareholders for their action or consideration, including the election of directors. As a result of Aron Govil\u2019s and Saagar Govil\u2019s ownership of our common stock and Aron Govil\u2019s ownership of our Series A and Series C preferred stock and Series 1 preferred stock, our management stockholders control, and will control in the future, substantially all matters requiring approval by the stockholders of our company, including the election of all directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This could make it impossible for public stockholders to influence the affairs of our company.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of our Series 1 warrants and stock options, and shares issued as consideration in future acquisitions, or the market perceives that such sales may occur, the market price of our common stock could fall and we may be unable to sell our common stock in the future.\nOur common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which could lead to costly litigation for us and make an investment in us less appealing.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf our business strategy and plans;\n\u25cf changing factors related to doing business in various jurisdictions within the United States;\n\u25cf new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines and timing of regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf general and industry-specific economic conditions;\n\u25cf additions to or departures of our key personnel;\n\u25cf variations in our quarterly financial and operating results;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of other companies that operate in our business segments or in our industry;\n\u25cf lack of trading liquidity;\n\u25cf announcements about our business partners;\n\u25cf changes in accounting principles; and\n\u25cf general market conditions.\nThe market prices of the securities of early-stage companies, particularly companies like ours without consistent product revenues and earnings, have been highly volatile and are likely to remain highly volatile in the future. This volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In the past, companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities have often faced securities class action litigation. Whether or not meritorious, litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Series 1 preferred stock and all of our existing and future indebtedness rank senior to our common stock in the event of a liquidation, winding up or dissolution of our business.\nIn the event of our liquidation, winding up or dissolution, our assets would be available to make payments to holders of all existing and future indebtedness and Series 1 preferred stock before payments to holders of our common stock. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up, there may not be sufficient assets remaining, after paying amounts to the holders of our indebtedness and Series 1 preferred stock, to pay anything to common stockholders. As of September 30, 2020, we had total consolidated debt of approximately $19.4 million and 2,156,784 shares of Series 1 preferred stock outstanding. Any liquidation, winding up or dissolution of our company or of any of our wholly or partially owned subsidiaries would have a material adverse effect on holders of our common stock.\nOur common stockholders may be adversely affected by the issuance of any subsequent series of preferred stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation does not restrict our ability to offer one or more additional new series of preferred stock, any or all of which may rank equally with or have preferences over our common stock as to dividend payments, voting rights, rights upon liquidation or other types of rights. We would have no obligation to consider the specific interests of the holders of common stock in creating any such new series of preferred stock or engaging in any such offering or transaction. Our creation of any new series of preferred stock or our engaging in any such offering or transaction could have a material adverse effect on holders of our common stock.\nThe public trading market for the common stock may be limited in the future.\nOur common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol CETX. The trading volume fluctuates and there have been time periods during which the common stock trading volume has been limited. Management can make no assurances that trading volume will not be similarly limited in the future. Without an active trading market, there can be no assurance of any liquidity or resale value of the common stock, and stockholders may be required to hold their shares of common stock for an indefinite period of time.\nWe may not pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nOur board of directors declared a one-time cash dividend on our common stock in April 2017. The terms of our series 1 preferred stock provide for the payment of semiannual dividends on the last day of March and September in each year, which began in March 2017. No other cash dividends have been declared or paid by us on our stock during either of the two most recent fiscal years or the period through the date of this prospectus. Other than with respect to our series 1 preferred stock, our board of directors declares dividends when, in its discretion, it determines that a dividend payment, as opposed to another use of cash, is in the best interests of the stockholders. Such decisions are based on the facts and circumstances then existing including, without limitation, our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. As a result, we cannot predict when, or whether, another dividend on our common stock will be declared in the future.", "PERMNO": 15417, "SIC": 8711, "TIC": "CETX"}
