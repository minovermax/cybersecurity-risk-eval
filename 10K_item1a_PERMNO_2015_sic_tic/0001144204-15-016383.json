RISK FACTORS\nThe following important risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements made in this report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. If any of the circumstances or events described below actually arise or occur, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Actual dollar amounts are used in this Item 1 A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe highly cyclical nature of the industry may lead to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings and available cash.\nThe tanker industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of charter rates and profitability. Fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values result from changes in supply and demand both for tanker capacity and for oil and oil products. Factors affecting these changes in supply and demand are generally outside of the Company\u2019s control. The nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and could adversely affect the values of the Company\u2019s vessels or result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter revenues the Company earns, which could result in significant volatility in OSG\u2019s quarterly results and cash flows. Factors influencing the demand for tanker capacity include:\n\u00b7 supply and demand for, and availability of, energy resources such as oil, oil products and natural gas, which affect customers\u2019 need for vessel capacity;\n\u00b7 global and regional economic and political conditions, including armed conflicts, terrorist activities and strikes, that among other things could impact the supply of oil, as well as trading patterns and the demand for various vessel types;\n\u00b7 regional availability of refining capacity and inventories;\n\u00b7 changes in the production levels of crude oil (including in particular production by OPEC, the United States and other key producers);\n\u00b7 developments in international trade generally;\n\u00b7 changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including changes in the distances that cargoes are transported, changes in the price of crude oil and changes to the WTI and Brent oil pricing benchmarks;\n\u00b7 environmental and other legal and regulatory developments and concerns;\n\u00b7 construction or expansion of new or existing pipelines or railways;\n\u00b7 weather and natural disasters;\n\u00b7 competition from alternative sources of energy; and\n\u00b7 international sanctions, embargoes, import and export restrictions or nationalizations and wars.\nFactors influencing the supply of vessel capacity include:\n\u00b7 availability and pricing of other energy resources such as natural gas;\n\u00b7 the number of newbuilding deliveries;\n\u00b7 the scrapping rate of older vessels;\n\u00b7 the number of vessels being used for storage or as floating storage offloading service vessels;\n\u00b7 the conversion of vessels from transporting oil and oil products to carrying dry bulk cargo or vice versa;\n\u00b7 the number of vessels that are removed from service;\n21 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\n\u00b7 port or canal congestion; and\n\u00b7 environmental and maritime regulations.\nMany of the factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity will also, in the longer term, effectively influence the supply of tanker capacity, since decisions to build new capacity, invest in capital repairs, or to retain in service older obsolescent capacity are influenced by the general state of the marine transportation industry from time to time.\nThe market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG\u2019s liquidity or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition.\nThe market value of vessels has fluctuated over time. The fluctuation in market value of vessels over time is based upon various factors, including:\n\u00b7 age of the vessel;\n\u00b7 general economic and market conditions affecting the tanker industry, including the availability of vessel financing;\n\u00b7 number of vessels in the world fleet (or, in the case of the U.S. domestic market, the Jones Act fleet);\n\u00b7 types and sizes of vessels available;\n\u00b7 changes in trading patterns affecting demand for particular sizes and types of vessels;\n\u00b7 cost of newbuildings;\n\u00b7 prevailing level of charter rates;\n\u00b7 competition from other shipping companies;\n\u00b7 other modes of transportation; and\n\u00b7 technological advances in vessel design and propulsion.\nWorldwide vessel market values have, on average, generally declined over the past several years. In addition, as vessels grow older, they generally decline in value. These factors will affect the value of the Company\u2019s vessels at the time of any vessel sale. If OSG sells a vessel at a sale price that is less than the vessel\u2019s carrying amount on the Company\u2019s financial statements, OSG will incur a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. In addition, declining values of the Company\u2019s vessels could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by refinancing vessels.\nDeclines in charter rates and other market deterioration could cause OSG to incur impairment charges.\nThe Company evaluates the carrying amounts of its vessels to determine if events have occurred that would require an impairment of those vessels\u2019 carrying amounts. The recoverable amount of vessels is reviewed to determine whether there have been any events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recovered. This review for potential impairment indicators and projection of future cash flows related to the vessels is complex and requires the Company to make various estimates, including future freight rates, earnings from the vessels and discount rates. All of these items have historically been volatile. The Company evaluates the recoverable amount as the higher of either fair value less costs to sell or value in use. If the recoverable amount is less than the vessel\u2019s carrying amount of the vessel, the vessel is deemed impaired. The carrying values of the Company\u2019s vessels may differ significantly from their fair market value.\n22 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nAn increase in the supply of vessels without a commensurate increase in demand for such vessels could cause charter rates to remain at depressed levels or to further decline, which could adversely affect OSG\u2019s revenues, profitability and cash flows, as well as the value of its vessels.\nOSG depends on short term duration or \u201cspot\u201d, charters, for a significant portion of its revenues, which exposes OSG to fluctuations in market conditions. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, OSG derived approximately 51%, 52% and 64% respectively, of its TCE revenues in the spot market.\nThe marine transportation industry has historically been highly cyclical, as the profitability and asset values of companies in the industry have fluctuated based on changes in the supply and demand of vessels. If the number of new ships of a particular class delivered exceeds the number of vessels of that class being scrapped, available capacity in that class will increase The newbuilding order book (representing vessels in various stages of planning or construction) equaled 13%, 12% and 11% of the existing world tanker fleet as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\nIn the U.S. domestic market, since the first quarter of 2013, firm orders to build 14 tankers and nine ATBs have been announced, representing approximately 31% of the existing Jones Act fleet of Product Carriers and large ATBs (defined as vessels having carrying capacities of between 0.14 million barrels and 0.35 million barrels, which excludes numerous tank barges below 0.14 million barrel capacity and 11 much larger tankers dedicated exclusively to the Alaskan crude oil trade), which exceeds the anticipated levels of scrapping. Delivery of those tankers is expected to take place between 2015 and 2017. Given the smaller number of tankers operating in the U.S. domestic market, even a limited increase in capacity supply may negatively impact the market.\nVessel supply is also affected by the number of vessels being used for floating storage, since vessels used for storage are not available to transport crude oil or petroleum products. Utilization of vessels for storage is affected by expectations of changes in the price of oil and petroleum products, with utilization generally increasing if prices are expected to increase more than storage costs and generally decreasing if they are not. A reduction in vessel utilization for storage will generally increase vessel supply. In 2010, for example, 81 vessels were released from storage and reentered the trading fleet. Since the 2010 release until near the end of 2014, storage on vessels at sea has been low, in part because then-current prices of crude oil have generally exceeded the future prices, a condition that allows companies to replace inventories at lower prices, which encourages the drawdown of commercial inventories. Supply has exceeded demand during the past five years, resulting in lower charter rates across the International Flag fleet. Since December 2014, current prices of crude oil have generally been below future prices, resulting in an increase in vessels used for storage. However, the duration of this trend of higher future prices cannot be predicted. If this trend ceases or reverses, the charter rates for the Company\u2019s International Flag vessels could decrease to levels experienced during the past five years, which were well below historical averages. Any such development would have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s revenues, profitability and cash flows if sustained over a long period of time.\nShipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG\u2019s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses.\nOSG\u2019s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 marine disasters;\n\u00b7 bad weather;\n\u00b7 mechanical failures;\n\u00b7 human error;\n\u00b7 war, terrorism and piracy;\n\u00b7 grounding, fire, explosions and collisions; and\n\u00b7 other unforeseen circumstances or events.\n23 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nIn addition, transporting crude oil creates a risk of business interruptions due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities, labor strikes, port closings and boycotts. These hazards may result in death or injury to persons; loss of revenues or property; the payment of ransoms; environmental damage; higher insurance rates; damage to OSG\u2019s customer relationships; and market disruptions, delay or rerouting, which may also subject OSG to litigation. In addition, the operation of tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil. An oil spill may cause significant environmental damage and the associated costs could exceed the insurance coverage available to the Company. Compared to other types of vessels, tankers are also exposed to a higher risk of damage and loss by fire, whether ignited by a terrorist attack, collision, or other cause, due to the high flammability and high volume of the oil transported in tankers. Any of these events could result in loss of revenues, decreased cash flows and increased costs.\nWhile the Company carries insurance to protect against certain risks involved in the conduct of its business, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. For example, a catastrophic spill could exceed OSG\u2019s $1 billion per vessel insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on its operations. In addition, OSG may not be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future, and OSG cannot guarantee that any particular claim will be paid by its insurers. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. Furthermore, even if insurance coverage is adequate to cover the Company\u2019s losses, OSG may not be able to timely obtain a replacement ship in the event of a loss. OSG may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on its own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which OSG obtains insurance coverage for tort liability. OSG\u2019s payment of these calls could result in significant expenses which would reduce its profits and cash flows or cause losses.\nConstraints on capital availability have adversely affected the tanker industry and OSG\u2019s business.\nConstraints on capital that have occurred during recent years have adversely affected the financial condition of certain of the Company\u2019s customers, joint venture partners, financial lenders and suppliers. Entities that suffer a material adverse impact on their financial condition may be unable or unwilling to comply with their contractual commitments to OSG including the refusal or inability of customers to pay charter hire to OSG or the inability or unwillingness of joint venture partners or financial lenders to honor their commitments to contribute funds to a joint venture or lend funds. While OSG seeks to monitor the financial condition of its customers, joint venture partners, financial lenders and suppliers, the availability and accuracy of information about the financial condition of such entities and the actions that OSG may take to reduce possible losses resulting from the failure of such entities to comply with their contractual obligations may be limited. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s revenues, profitability and cash flows. In addition, adverse financial conditions may inhibit these entities from entering into new commitments with OSG, which could also have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s revenues, profitability and cash flows.\nThe Company also faces other potential constraints on capital relating to counterparty credit risk and constraints on OSG\u2019s ability to borrow funds. See also Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Our Company-The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings\u201d and Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Our Company-OSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, all of which could affect OSG\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness.\u201d\nOSG conducts its operations internationally, which subjects the Company to changing economic, political and governmental conditions abroad that may adversely affect its business.\nThe Company conducts its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed, including:\n\u00b7 regional or local economic downturns;\n\u00b7 labor rules and collective bargaining arrangements in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u00b7 changes in governmental policy or regulation;\n\u00b7 restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of countries in which OSG or its customers operate;\n\u00b7 difficulty in staffing and managing (including ensuring compliance with internal policies and controls) geographically widespread operations;\n24 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\n\u00b7 the effect of applicable tax structures, including potential liabilities relating to domestic and foreign withholding taxes and potential negative consequences from changes in tax laws;\n\u00b7 trade relations with foreign countries in which OSG\u2019s customers and suppliers have operations, including protectionist measures such as tariffs and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7 general economic and political conditions, which may interfere with, among other things, the Company\u2019s supply chain, its customers and all of OSG\u2019s activities in a particular location;\n\u00b7 difficulty in the enforcement of contractual obligations in foreign jurisdictions and the collection of accounts receivable from foreign accounts;\n\u00b7 different regulatory regimes in the various countries in which OSG operates;\n\u00b7 inadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries;\n\u00b7 the difficulties and increased expenses in complying with multiple and potentially conflicting domestic and foreign laws, regulations, security, product approvals and trade standards, anti-bribery laws, government sanctions and restrictions on doing business with certain nations or specially designated nationals;\n\u00b7 import and export duties and quotas;\n\u00b7 demands for improper payments from port officials or other government officials;\n\u00b7 domestic and foreign customs, tariffs and taxes;\n\u00b7 foreign currency exchange controls, restrictions and fluctuations, which could result in reduced revenue and increased operating expense;\n\u00b7 international incidents;\n\u00b7 transportation delays or interruptions;\n\u00b7 local conflicts, acts of war, terrorist attacks or military conflicts;\n\u00b7 changes in oil prices or disruptions in oil supplies that could substantially affect global trade, the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 operations and the Company\u2019s business;\n\u00b7 the imposition of taxes by flag states, port states and jurisdictions in which OSG or its subsidiaries are incorporated or where its vessels operate; and\n\u00b7 expropriation of OSG\u2019s vessels.\nThe occurrence of such events could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. In addition, OSG\u2019s international operations subject it to certain risks regarding taxation of foreign subsidiary income, see \u201c-Risks related to our Company- OSG\u2019s financial condition would be materially adversely affected if the shipping income of OSG\u2019s foreign subsidiaries becomes subject to current taxation in the United States.\u201d\nOSG must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, anti-money laundering laws; and anti-competition regulations. Moreover, the shipping industry is generally considered to present elevated risks in these areas. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on the Company\u2019s business operations and on the Company\u2019s ability to transport cargo to one or more countries, and could also materially affect the Company\u2019s brand, ability to attract and retain employees, international operations, business and operating results. Although OSG has policies and procedures designed to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations, OSG cannot be certain that its employees, contractors, joint venture partners or agents will not violate these policies and procedures.\n25 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nChanges in fuel prices may adversely affect profits.\nFuel is a significant, if not the largest, expense in the Company\u2019s shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charter. Accordingly, an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability if these increases cannot be passed onto customers. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside the Company\u2019s control, including geopolitical developments; supply and demand for oil and gas; actions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and other oil and gas producers; war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions; regional production patterns; and environmental concerns. Fuel may become much more expensive in the future, which could reduce the profitability and competitiveness of the Company\u2019s business compared to other forms of transportation.\nActs of piracy on ocean-going vessels could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe frequency of pirate attacks on seagoing vessels remains high, particularly in the western part of the Indian Ocean, off the west coast of Africa and in the South China Sea. If piracy attacks result in regions in which the Company\u2019s vessels are deployed being characterized by insurers as \u201cwar risk\u201d zones, as the Gulf of Aden has been, or Joint War Committee \u201cwar and strikes\u201d listed areas, premiums payable for insurance coverage could increase significantly, and such insurance coverage may become difficult to obtain. Crew costs could also increase in such circumstances due to risks of piracy attacks.\nIn addition, while OSG believes the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, the charterer may dispute this and withhold charter hire until the vessel is released. A charterer may also claim that a vessel seized by pirates was not \u201con-hire\u201d for a certain number of days and it is therefore entitled to cancel the charter party, a claim the Company would dispute. The Company may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against the Company\u2019s vessels, or an increase in the cost (or unavailability) of insurance for those vessels, could have a material adverse impact on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such attacks may also impact the Company\u2019s customers, which could impair their ability to make payments to the Company under its charters.\nTerrorist attacks and international hostilities and instability can affect the tanker industry, which could adversely affect OSG\u2019s business.\nTerrorist attacks, the outbreak of war, or the existence of international hostilities could damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect both the Company\u2019s ability to charter its vessels and the charter rates payable under any such charters. In addition, OSG operates in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability, terrorist or other attacks, war or international hostilities. In the past, political instability has also resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region. These factors could also increase the costs to the Company of conducting its business, particularly crew, insurance and security costs, and prevent or restrict the Company from obtaining insurance coverage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nOSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, all of which could affect OSG\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2014, OSG had $1.67 billion of outstanding indebtedness. OSG\u2019s substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences, including:\n\u00b7 limiting OSG\u2019s ability to use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations in other areas of its business, including for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities, because OSG must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service its debt;\n\u00b7 to the extent OSG\u2019s future cash flows are insufficient, requiring the Company to seek to incur additional indebtedness in order to make planned capital expenditures and other expenses or investments;\n26 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\n\u00b7 limiting OSG\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and other expenses or investments planned by the Company;\n\u00b7 limiting the Company\u2019s flexibility and ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulation, and OSG\u2019s business and industry;\n\u00b7 limiting OSG\u2019s ability to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness;\n\u00b7 increasing OSG\u2019s vulnerability to a downturn in its business and to adverse economic and industry conditions generally;\n\u00b7 placing OSG at a competitive disadvantage as compared to its less-leveraged competitors;\n\u00b7 limiting the Company\u2019s ability, or increasing the costs, to refinance indebtedness; and\n\u00b7 limiting the Company\u2019s ability to enter into hedging transactions by reducing the number of counterparties with whom OSG can enter into such transactions as well as the volume of those transactions.\nOSG\u2019s ability to continue to fund its obligations and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic, financial market, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things. An inability to fund the Company\u2019s debt requirements or reduce debt could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, the actual or perceived credit quality of the Company\u2019s charterers (as well as any defaults by them) could materially affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain the additional capital resources that it will require to purchase additional vessels or significantly increase the costs of obtaining such capital. The Company\u2019s inability to obtain additional financing at a higher-than-anticipated cost, or at all, could materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operation and its ability to implement its business strategy.\nThe Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness, and could in the future breach covenants in its credit facilities and term loans.\nThe Company\u2019s earnings, cash flow and the market value of its vessels vary significantly over time due to the cyclical nature of the tanker industry, as well as general economic and market conditions affecting the industry. As a result, the amount of debt that OSG can manage in some periods may not be appropriate in other periods and its ability to meet the financial covenants to which it is subject or may be subject in the future may vary. Additionally, future cash flow may be insufficient to meet the Company\u2019s debt obligations and commitments. Any insufficiency could negatively impact OSG\u2019s business.\nEach Exit Financing Facility contains certain restrictions relating to new borrowings and, the movement of funds between the borrowers thereunder and OSG, as set forth in the respective loan agreements. In addition, the OIN Revolver Facility has a covenant to maintain the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Collateral Vessels (each as defined in that loan agreement) at greater than or equal to $500.0 million at the end of the each fiscal quarter. None of the other Exit Financing Facilities have financial covenants. Furthermore, drawdowns under the OBS ABL Facility borrowings are limited based upon the available borrowing base, as defined in that loan agreement and, if availability falls below a certain amount for a specified period of time, the administrative agent could exercise cash dominion rights permitting it to invoke control rights over certain of our accounts. While the Company was in compliance with these requirements as of December 31, 2014, a decrease in vessel values or a failure to meet this ratio could cause the Company to breach certain covenants in its existing credit facilities and term loans, or in future financing agreements that the Company may enter into from time to time. If the Company breaches such covenants and is unable to remedy the relevant breach or obtain a waiver, the Company\u2019s lenders could accelerate its debt and foreclose on the Company\u2019s owned vessels.\nA range of economic, competitive, financial, business, industry and other factors will affect future financial performance, and, accordingly, the Company\u2019s ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay debt and to meet the financial covenants under the OIN Revolver Facility. Many of these factors, such as charter rates, economic and financial conditions in the tanker industry and the global economy or competitive initiatives of competitors, are beyond the Company\u2019s control. If OSG does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt obligations, it may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:\n\u00b7 refinancing or restructuring its debt;\n27 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\n\u00b7 selling tankers or other assets;\n\u00b7 reducing or delaying investments and capital expenditures; or\n\u00b7 seeking to raise additional capital.\nUndertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, might not allow OSG to meet its debt obligations. The Company\u2019s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets, its access to such markets and its financial condition at that time. Any refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and might require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict OSG\u2019s business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict OSG from adopting some of certain alternatives. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit OSG to meet its scheduled debt service obligations. The Company\u2019s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, to meet the covenants of its credit agreements and term loans and/or to obtain alternative financing in such circumstances, could materially and adversely affect OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company will be required to make additional capital expenditures to expand the number of vessels in its fleet and to maintain all of its vessels, which depend on additional financing.\nThe Company\u2019s business strategy is based in part upon the expansion of its fleet through the purchase of additional vessels at attractive points. If OSG is unable to fulfill its obligations under any memorandum of agreement or newbuilding construction contract for future vessel acquisitions, the sellers of such vessels may be permitted to terminate such contracts and the Company may be required to forfeit all or a portion of the down payments it made under such contracts and it may also be sued for any outstanding balance. In addition, as a newbuilding vessel must be drydocked within five years of its delivery from a shipyard, with survey cycles of no more than 60 months for the first three surveys, and 30 months thereafter, not including any unexpected repairs, the Company will incur significant maintenance costs for its existing and any newly-acquired vessels. As a result, if the Company does not utilize its vessels as planned, these maintenance costs could have material adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company depends on third party service providers for technical and commercial management of its International Flag fleet.\nThe Company currently outsources to third party service providers certain management services of its International Flag fleet, including technical management, certain aspects of commercial management and crew management. In particular, the Company has entered into ship management agreements with V.Ships that assign technical management responsibilities to V.Ships for each vessel in the Company\u2019s owned or bareboat chartered-in International Flag conventional tanker fleet (collectively, the \u201cShip Management Agreements\u201d). The Company has also transferred commercial management of its International Flag conventional tanker fleet to certain other third party service providers, principally shipping pools.\nIn such outsourcing arrangements, the Company has transferred direct control over technical and commercial management of the relevant vessels and must rely on third party service providers to, among other things:\n\u00b7 comply with contractual commitments to the Company, including with respect to safety, quality and environmental compliance of the operations of the Company\u2019s vessels;\n\u00b7 comply with requirements imposed by the U.S. government (i) restricting calls on ports located in countries that are subject to sanctions and embargoes and (ii) prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices;\n\u00b7 respond to changes in customer demands for the Company\u2019s vessels;\n\u00b7 obtain supplies and materials necessary for the operation and maintenance of the Company\u2019s vessels; and\n\u00b7 mitigate the impact of labor shortages and/or disruptions relating to crews on the Company\u2019s vessels.\nThe third-party service providers the Company has selected may not provide a standard of service comparable to that the Company provided for such vessels prior to any outsourcing. Furthermore, damage to any such third party\u2019s reputation, relationships or business may reflect on the Company directly or indirectly, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s reputation and business.\n28 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nV.Ships has the right to terminate the Ship Management Agreements at any time with 90 days\u2019 notice. If V.Ships exercises that right, the Company will be required either to enter into substitute agreements with other third parties or to assume those management duties. The Company may not succeed in negotiating and entering into such agreements with other third parties and, even if it does so, the terms and conditions of such agreements may be less favorable to the Company. Furthermore, if the Company is required to dedicate internal resources to managing the International Flag conventional tanker fleet (including, but not limited to, hiring additional qualified personnel or diverting existing resources), that could result in increased costs and reduced efficiency and profitability. Any such changes could disrupt the Company\u2019s business and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe contribution of the Company\u2019s joint ventures to its profits and losses may fluctuate, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nThe Company currently owns an interest in six of its vessels through two 50%-owned joint ventures, together with other third-party vessel owners and operators in the Company\u2019s industry. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Fleet Operations.\u201d The Company\u2019s ownership in these joint ventures is accounted for using the equity method, which means that the Company\u2019s allocation of profits and losses of the applicable joint venture is included in its consolidated financial statements. The contribution of the Company\u2019s joint ventures to the Company\u2019s profits and losses may fluctuate, including the distributions that it may receive from such entities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA joint venture involves certain risks such as:\n\u00b7 OSG may not have voting control over the joint venture;\n\u00b7 OSG may not be able to maintain good relationships with its joint venture partner;\n\u00b7 The joint venture partner at any time may have economic or business interests that are inconsistent with OSG\u2019s;\n\u00b7 The joint venture partner may fail to fund its share of capital for operations or to fulfill its other commitments, including providing accurate and timely accounting and financial information to OSG;\n\u00b7 The joint venture may experience operating difficulties and financial losses, which may lead to asset write-downs or impairment charges that could negatively impact the operating results of the joint venture and OSG;\n\u00b7 The joint venture or venture partner could lose key personnel; and\n\u00b7 The joint venture partner could become bankrupt requiring OSG to assume all risks and capital requirements related to the joint venture project, and the related bankruptcy proceedings could have an adverse impact on the operation of the partnership or joint venture.\nIf events relating to any of these risks were to come to pass, that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s participation in the relevant joint venture, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOSG\u2019s business depends on spot charters, and any future decrease in spot charter rates could adversely affect its earnings.\nVoyage charters, including vessels operating in Commercial Pools that predominantly operate in the spot market, constituted 51% of OSG\u2019s aggregate TCE revenues in 2014, 52% in 2013 and 64% in 2012. Accordingly, OSG\u2019s shipping revenues are significantly affected by prevailing spot rates for voyage charters in the markets in which the Company\u2019s vessels operate. The spot charter market may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon tanker and oil supply and demand. For example, over the past five years, VLCC spot market rates (expressed as a time charter equivalent) have ranged from a high of $87,500 per day to negative values, and in December 2014 were $87,500 per day on the benchmark route between the Middle East Gulf and Japan. The successful operation of OSG\u2019s vessels in the competitive spot charter market depends on, among other things, obtaining profitable spot charters and minimizing, to the extent possible, time spent waiting for charters and time spent traveling unladen to pick up cargo. The spot market is very volatile, and, in the past, there have been periods when spot charter rates have declined below the operating cost of vessels. If spot charter rates decline in the future, then OSG may be unable to operate its vessels trading in the spot market profitably, or meet its other obligations, including payments on indebtedness. Furthermore, as charter rates for spot charters are fixed for a single voyage, which may last up to several weeks during periods in which spot charter rates are rising or falling, OSG will generally experience delays in realizing the benefits from, or experiencing the detriments of those changes. See also Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Operations-Charter Types.\u201d\n29 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nOSG may not be able to renew time charters when they expire or enter into new time charters for newbuilds.\nOSG\u2019s ability to renew expiring contracts or obtain new charters will depend on the prevailing market conditions at the time of renewal. As of December 31, 2014, OSG employed 20 vessels on time charters, with four of those charters expiring in 2015, nine expiring in 2016, three expiring in 2017, three expiring in 2018 and two expiring in 2020 or thereafter. The Company\u2019s existing time charters may not be renewed at comparable rates or if renewed or entered into, those new contracts may be at less favorable rates. In addition, there may be a gap in employment of vessels between current charters and subsequent charters. If at a time when OSG is seeking to arrange new charters for its vessels, market participants expect that less capacity will be necessary in the future (for example, if it is expected that oil and natural gas prices will decrease in the future, which could suggest that future oil and gas production levels will decline from then-current levels), OSG may not be able to obtain charters at attractive rates or at all. If, upon expiration of the existing time charters or delivery of newbuilds, OSG is unable to obtain time charters or voyage charters at desirable rates, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nTermination of, or a change in the nature of, OSG\u2019s relationship with any of the pools in which it participates could adversely affect its business.\nAs of December 31, 2014, all six of the Company\u2019s VLCCs participate in the TI pool; four of OSG\u2019s seven Aframaxes participate in the SIGMA pool; four of the Company\u2019s eight crude Panamaxes and one of its two Panamax Product Carriers participate directly in the PI pool; nine of its MRs participate in the CPTA pool; five of its MRs participate in the HDT pool; and five of its MRs participate in the CPI pool (an aggregate of 19 MRs out of a total of 22). OSG\u2019s participation in these pools is intended to enhance the financial performance of the Company\u2019s vessels through higher vessel utilization. Any participant in any of these pools has the right to withdraw upon notice in accordance with the relevant pool agreement. Changes in the management of, and the terms of, these pools, decreases in the number of vessels participating in these pools, or the termination of these pools, could result in increased costs and reduced efficiency and profitability for the Company.\nIn addition, in recent years the EU has published guidelines on the application of the EU antitrust rules to traditional agreements for maritime services such as pools. While the Company believes that all the pools it participates in comply with EU rules, there has been limited administrative and judicial interpretation of the rules. Restrictive interpretations of the guidelines could adversely affect the ability to commercially market the respective types of vessels in pools.\nIn the highly competitive international market, OSG may not be able to compete effectively for charters.\nThe Company\u2019s vessels are employed in a highly competitive market. Competition arises from other vessel owners, including major oil companies, which may have substantially greater resources than OSG does. Competition for the transportation of crude oil and other petroleum products depends on price, location, size, age, condition, and the acceptability of the vessel operator to the charterer. The Company believes that because ownership of the world tanker fleet is highly fragmented, no single vessel owner is able to influence charter rates. To the extent OSG enters into new geographic regions or provides new services, it may not be able to compete profitably. New markets may involve competitive factors that differ from those of the Company\u2019s current markets, and the competitors in those markets may have greater financial strength and capital resources than OSG does.\nOSG may not realize the benefits it expects from past acquisitions or acquisitions it may make in the future.\nOSG\u2019s business strategy includes ongoing efforts to engage in material acquisitions of ownership interests in entities in the tanker industry and of individual tankers. The success of OSG\u2019s acquisitions will depend upon a number of factors, some of which may not be within its control. These factors include OSG\u2019s ability to:\n\u00b7 identify suitable tankers and/or shipping companies for acquisitions at attractive prices, which may not be possible if asset prices rise too quickly;\n\u00b7 obtain financing;\n\u00b7 identify businesses engaged in managing, operating or owning tankers for acquisitions or joint ventures;\n30 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\n\u00b7 integrate any acquired tankers or businesses successfully with the OSG\u2019s then-existing operations; and\n\u00b7 enhance OSG\u2019s customer base;\nOSG intends to finance these acquisitions by using available cash from operations and through incurrence of debt or bridge financing, either of which may increase its leverage ratios, or by issuing equity, which may have a dilutive impact on its existing shareholders. At any given time OSG may be engaged in a number of discussions that may result in one or more acquisitions, some of which may be material to OSG as a whole. These opportunities require confidentiality and may involve negotiations that require quick responses by OSG. Although there can be no certainty that any of these discussions will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transactions, the announcement of any such transaction may lead to increased volatility in the trading price of OSG\u2019s securities.\nAcquisitions can also involve a number of special risks and challenges, including:\n\u00b7 diversion of management time and attention from the Company\u2019s existing business and other business opportunities;\n\u00b7 delays in closing or the inability to close an acquisition for any reason, including third-party consents or approvals;\n\u00b7 any unanticipated negative impact on the Company of disclosed or undisclosed matters relating to any vessels or operations acquired; and\n\u00b7 assumption of debt or other liabilities of the acquired business, including litigation related to the acquired business.\nThe success of acquisitions or strategic investments depends on the effective integration of newly acquired businesses or assets into OSG\u2019s current operations. Such integration is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel and clients, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company or asset. OSG may not realize the strategic and financial benefits that it expects from any of its past acquisitions, or any future acquisitions. Further, if a portion of the purchase price of a business is attributable to goodwill and if the acquired business does not perform up to expectations at the time of the acquisition some or all of the goodwill may be written off, adversely affecting OSG\u2019s earnings. We have recorded material write-offs of goodwill and intangible assets in prior years related to earlier acquisitions consummated by us.\nChanges in demand in specialized markets in which the Company currently trades may lead the Company to redeploy certain vessels to other markets.\nThe Company deploys its vessels in several specialized markets, including, without limitation, Lightering in the Delaware Bay. The Company conducts those Lightering operations with two articulated tug barges (\u201cATBs\u201d) which were constructed using funds withdrawn from the Company\u2019s CCF. If lower demand in these markets adversely affects the Company\u2019s financial position, the Company may have to consider redeploying these two ATBs in other markets. If that occurs, the Company may not be able to compete profitably in the new markets, and the ATBs may not be able to be redeployed to new markets without substantial modification.\nOperating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company\u2019s vessels age and may also increase due to unanticipated events relating to secondhand vessels and the consolidation of suppliers.\nIn general, capital expenditures and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. As of December 31, 2014, the weighted average age of the Company\u2019s total owned and operated fleet was 10.2 years. In addition, older vessels are typically less fuel-efficient than more recently constructed vessels due to improvements in engine technology. Cargo insurance rates are also expected to increase with the age of a vessel, since older vessels may be less desirable to charterers. Accordingly, it is likely that the operating costs of OSG\u2019s currently operated vessels will increase. In addition, changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may restrict the type of activities in which the vessels may engage and/or may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. In order to add such equipment, OSG may be required to take its vessels out of service. Market conditions may not justify such expenditures or permit OSG to operate its older vessels profitably even if those vessels remain operational.\n31 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s fleet includes a number of secondhand vessels. While the Company typically inspects secondhand vessels before it purchases them, those inspections do not necessarily provide OSG with the same level of knowledge about those vessels\u2019 condition that OSG would have had if these vessels had been built for and operated exclusively by it. The Company may not discover defects or other problems with such vessels before purchase, which may lead to expensive, unanticipated repairs, and could even result in accidents or other incidents for which the Company could be liable.\nFurthermore, recent mergers have reduced the number of available suppliers, resulting in fewer alternatives for sourcing key supplies. With respect to certain items, OSG is generally dependent upon the original equipment manufacturer for repair and replacement of the item or its spare parts. Supplier consolidation may result in a shortage of supplies and services, thereby increasing the cost of supplies or potentially inhibiting the ability of suppliers to deliver on time. These cost increases or delays could result in downtime, and delays in the repair and maintenance of the Company\u2019s vessels and FSOs and have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company derives a substantial portion of its U.S. Flag segment\u2019s revenue from a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect the U.S. Flag segment\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. Flag segment\u2019s largest customers account for a significant portion of its revenues. The U.S. Flag segment\u2019s top five customers comprised approximately 56% of the U.S. Flag segment\u2019s revenues during 2014. The loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect the U.S. Flag segment\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain potential customers will not use vessels older than a specified age, even if they have been subsequently rebuilt.\nAll of the Company\u2019s existing ATBs with the exception of the OSG Vision/OSG 350 and the OSG Horizon/OSG 351were originally constructed more than 25 years ago. While all of these tug-barge units were rebuilt and double-hulled since 1998 and are \u201cin-class,\u201d meaning the vessel has been certified by a Classification Society as being built and maintained in accordance with the rules of that Classification Society and complies with the applicable rules and regulations of the vessel\u2019s country of registry and applicable international conventions, some potential customers have stated that they will not charter vessels that are more than 20 years old, even if they have been rebuilt. Other customers may not continue to view rebuilt vessels as suitable. If more customers differentiate rebuilt vessels, time charter rates for the Company\u2019s rebuilt ATBs will likely be adversely affected or they may not be employable.\nThe Company\u2019s significant operating leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced.\nThe Company\u2019s operating fleet includes 18 vessels that have been chartered-in under operating leases. The significant operating leases of the Company in its various businesses expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced at all or on as favorable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s future financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts, and any failure by those counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings.\nThe Company has entered into, and in the future will enter into, various contracts, including charter agreements, joint venture agreements and other agreements associated with the operation of its vessels. The Company charters its vessels to other parties, who pay the Company a daily rate of hire. The Company also enters COAs and Voyage Charters. Historically, the Company has not experienced material problems collecting charter hire but the global economic downturn of recent years has affected charterers more severely than the prior recessions that have occurred since the Company\u2019s establishment more than 45 years ago. The Company also time charters or bareboat charters some of its vessels from other parties and its continued use and operation of such vessels depends on the vessel owners\u2019 compliance with the terms of the time charter or bareboat charter. Additionally, the Company enters into derivative contracts (interest rate swaps and caps) from time to time. As a result, the Company is subject to credit risks. The ability of each of the Company\u2019s counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with it will depend on a number of factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions; availability of debt or equity financing; the condition of the maritime and offshore industries; the overall financial condition of the counterparty; charter rates received for specific types of vessels; and various expenses. Charterers are sensitive to the commodity markets and may be impacted by market forces affecting commodities such as oil. In addition, in depressed market conditions, the Company\u2019s charterers and customers may no longer need a vessel that is currently under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rates. As a result, the Company\u2019s customers may fail to pay charter hire or attempt to renegotiate charter rates. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues, cash flows and earnings.\n32 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nThe counterparty to OSG\u2019s largest Delaware Bay Lightering contract has approached the Company about restructuring the contract to lower the minimum volumes contained therein and has indicated that the termination or reduction payment that they would be required to make under the terms of the underlying contract would pose an unreasonable economic burden. If the counterparty fails to comply with the terms of the existing long-term contract, including provisions requiring that compensation be paid to the Company under certain circumstances, and OSG is unable to obtain replacement time charters at desirable rates, the Company\u2019s profitability and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe cannot be certain that the bankruptcy proceedings will not adversely affect our operations going forward.\nWe emerged from bankruptcy on August 5, 2014. The full extent to which our bankruptcy will impact our business operations, reputation and relationships with our customers, employees, regulators and agents may not be known for some time and could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company depends on its key personnel and may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees.\nOSG\u2019s success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of its key personnel. The loss of the services of key personnel or the Company\u2019s inability to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, all of the Company\u2019s seven executive officers have served in their current positions for less than nine months and all the members of the Board were first elected in August 2014.\nWork stoppages or other labor disruptions by the unionized employees of OSG or other companies in related industries may adversely affect OSG\u2019s operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, OSG had 890 regular full-time employees, of which 632 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Employees.\u201d In addition, OSG relies on the services of third parties who employ persons covered by collective bargaining agreements. OSG could be adversely affected by actions taken by employees of OSG or other companies in related industries (including third parties providing services to OSG) against efforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefits increases or modify work practices or the failure of OSG or other companies in its industry to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements.\nThe Company may face unexpected drydock costs for its vessels.\nVessels must be drydocked periodically. For example, the U.S. Coast Guard requires the Company\u2019s vessels to be drydocked for inspection and maintenance twice every five years. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty, can be substantial and the Company\u2019s insurance does not cover these costs. In addition, vessels may have to be drydocked in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage, and OSG\u2019s insurance may not cover all of these costs. Vessels in drydock will generally not generate any income. Large drydocking expenses could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements, and accordingly the length of time that a vessel may be off-hire may be longer than anticipated, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTechnological innovation could reduce the Company\u2019s charter income and the value of the Company\u2019s vessels.\nThe charter rates and the value and operational life of a vessel are determined by a number of factors including the vessel\u2019s efficiency, operational flexibility and physical life. Efficiency includes speed, fuel economy and the ability to load and discharge cargo quickly. Flexibility includes the ability to enter harbors, utilize related docking facilities and pass through canals and straits. The length of a vessel\u2019s physical life is related to its original design and construction, its maintenance and the impact of the stress of operations. If new tankers are built that are more efficient or more flexible or have longer physical lives than the Company\u2019s vessels, competition from these more technologically advanced vessels could adversely affect the amount of charter payments the Company receives for its vessels once their initial charters expire and the resale value of the Company\u2019s vessels could significantly decrease. As a result, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n33 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nInterruption or failure of OSG\u2019s information technology and communications systems could impair its ability to operate and adversely affect its business.\nOSG is highly dependent on information technology systems. These dependencies include accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and communication systems. Information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions. OSG may experience failures caused by the occurrence of a natural disaster, computer hacking or viruses or other unanticipated problems at OSG\u2019s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. Any failure of OSG\u2019s or third-party systems could result in interruptions in service, reductions in its revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability for the release of confidential information.\nA portion of OSG\u2019s revenues are subject to seasonal variations.\nOSG operates its tankers in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand for tanker capacity, and therefore, charter rates. Peaks in tanker demand quite often precede seasonal oil consumption peaks, as refiners and suppliers anticipate consumer demand. Charter rates for tankers are typically higher in the fall and winter months as a result of increased oil consumption in the Northern Hemisphere. Unpredictable weather patterns and variations in oil reserves disrupt tanker scheduling. Because a majority of the Company\u2019s vessels trade in the spot market, seasonality has affected OSG\u2019s operating results on a quarter-to-quarter basis and could continue to do so in the future. Such seasonality may be outweighed in any period by then current economic conditions or tanker industry fundamentals.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nThe Company\u2019s business would be adversely affected if it failed to comply with the Jones Act\u2019s limitations on U.S. coastwise trade, or if these limitations were waived, modified or repealed, or if changes in international trade agreements were to occur.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s U.S. Flag operations are conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade and are governed by U.S. federal laws commonly known as the \u201cJones Act\u201d. The Jones Act restricts waterborne transportation of goods between points in the United States to vessels meeting certain requirements, including ownership and control by \u201cU.S. Citizens\u201d as defined thereunder (as so defined, \u201cU.S. Citizens\u201d). The Company is responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of its common stock and other interests to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. The Company could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the Jones Act trade if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of the equity interests in the Company. Such loss would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. In addition, under certain circumstances failure to comply with the Jones Act may result in the Company being deemed to have violated other U.S. federal laws that prohibit a foreign transfer of U.S. documented vessels without government approval, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading privileges or forfeiture of the vessels deemed transferred, and fines.\nAdditionally, maritime transportation services are currently excluded from the General Agreement on Trade in Services (\u201cGATS\u201d) and are the subject of reservations by the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) and other international free trade agreements. If maritime transportation services were included in GATS, NAFTA or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international flag or foreign built vessels. During the past several years, interest groups have lobbied Congress, and legislation has been introduced, to repeal certain provisions of the Jones Act to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act. The Company expects that continued efforts will be made to modify or repeal the Jones Act. Because international vessels may have lower construction costs, wage rates and operating costs, this could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n34 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nGovernments could requisition the Company\u2019s vessels during a period of war or emergency, which may negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash.\nA government could requisition one or more of the Company\u2019s vessels for title or hire. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes the owner. Requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes the charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during a period of war or emergency. In addition, two OSG vessels participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program, which ensures that militarily useful U.S. Flag vessels are available to the U.S. Department of Defense in the event of war or national emergency. These vessels are required to trade outside the United States but are eligible for government-sponsored business. Under the program, OSG receives an annual fee, subject in each case to annual Congressional appropriations, in exchange for a guarantee that the ships will be made available to the U.S. government in the time of war or national emergency. Government requisition of one or more of the Company\u2019s vessels may negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash.\nThe Company\u2019s vessels may be directed to call on ports located in countries that are subject to restrictions imposed by the U.S. government, which could negatively affect the trading price of the Company\u2019s common shares.\nFrom time to time, certain of the Company\u2019s vessels, on the instructions of the charterers or pool manager responsible for the commercial management of such vessels, have called and may again call on ports located in countries or territories, and/or operated by persons, subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government, the United Nations (\u201cUN\u201d) or the EU and countries identified by the U.S. government, the UN or the EU as state sponsors of terrorism. The U.S., UN and EU sanctions and embargo laws and regulations vary in their application, as they do not all apply to the same covered persons or proscribe the same activities, and such sanctions and embargo laws and regulations may be amended or expanded over time. Some sanctions may also apply to transportation of goods (including crude oil) originating in sanctioned countries (particularly Iran), even if the vessel does not travel to those countries, or otherwise acting on behalf of sanctioned persons. Sanctions may include the imposition of penalties and fines against companies violating national law or companies acting outside the jurisdiction of the sanctioning power themselves becoming the target of sanctions.\nAlthough OSG believes that it is in compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations and intends to maintain such compliance, and OSG does not, and does not intend to, engage in sanctionable activity, OSG might fail to comply or may engage in a sanctionable activity in the future, particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to changing interpretations. Any such violation or sanctionable activity could result in fines or other penalties, or the imposition of sanctions against the Company, and could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to divest their interest, or not to invest, in the Company and negatively affect OSG\u2019s reputation and investor perception of the value of OSG\u2019s common stock.\nCompliance with complex laws, regulations, and, in particular, environmental laws or regulations, including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gases, may adversely affect OSG\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are affected by extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards in force in international waters, the jurisdictional waters of the countries in which OSG\u2019s vessels operate, as well as the countries of its vessels\u2019 registration. Many of these requirements are designed to reduce the risk of oil spills. They also regulate other water pollution issues, including discharge of ballast water and effluents and air emissions, including emission of greenhouse gases. These requirements impose significant capital and operating costs on OSG, including, without limitation, ones related to engine adjustments and ballast water treatment.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations also can affect the resale value or significantly reduce the useful lives of the Company\u2019s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions (and related increased operating costs) or retirement of service, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, certain jurisdictional waters or ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, in the event that there is a release of petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could also become subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company\u2019s vessels.\n35 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nOSG could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties, third-party claims and natural resource damages, as the result of an oil spill or liabilities under environmental laws. The Company is subject to the oversight of several government agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. OPA 90 affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters.\nIn addition, in complying with OPA 90, IMO regulations, EU directives and other existing laws and regulations and those that may be adopted, shipowners likely will incur substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures in meeting new regulatory requirements, in developing contingency arrangements for potential spills and in obtaining insurance coverage. Key regulatory initiatives that are anticipated to require substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures in the next several years include more stringent limits on the sulfur content of fuel oil for vessels operating in certain areas and more stringent requirements for management and treatment of ballast water. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness- Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping.\u201d Other government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental requirements, can be expected to become more strict in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures on its vessels to keep them in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. Such expenditures could result in financial and operational impacts that may be material to OSG\u2019s financial statements. Additionally, the failure of a shipowner or bareboat charterer to comply with local, domestic and foreign regulations may subject it to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. For example, in February 2015, the U.S. Coast Guard personnel detained the tanker Overseas Jademar in Port Angeles, Washington for violation of safety regulations, which included non-functioning distress signaling equipment and fire safety systems. If any of our vessels are denied access to, or are detained in, certain ports, reputation, business, financial results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nAccidents involving highly publicized oil spills and other mishaps involving vessels can be expected in the tanker industry, and such accidents or other events could be expected to result in the adoption of even stricter laws and regulations, which could limit the Company\u2019s operations or its ability to do business and which could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial results and cash flows. In addition, the Company is required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to its operations. The Company believes its vessels are maintained in good condition in compliance with present regulatory requirements, are operated in compliance with applicable safety and environmental laws and regulations and are insured against usual risks for such amounts as the Company\u2019s management deems appropriate. The vessels\u2019 operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during each vessel\u2019s required annual survey. However, government regulation of tankers, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental impact may change in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures with respect to its ships to keep them in compliance.\nDue to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries, including the United States, and international organizations, including the EU, the IMO and the UN, have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory measures include, among others, adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Such actions could result in significant financial and operational impacts on the Company\u2019s business, including requiring OSG to install new emission controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions, or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emission program. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping.\u201d In addition to the added costs, the concern over climate change and regulatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may reduce global demand for oil and oil products, which would have an adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial results and cash flows.\n36 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nThe Company may be subject to litigation and government inquiries or investigations that, if not resolved in the Company\u2019s favor and not sufficiently covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on it.\nThe Company has been and is, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters and subject to government inquiries and investigations. These matters may include, among other things, regulatory proceedings and litigation arising out of or relating to matters related to the restatement of the Company\u2019s financial statements in 2012, contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, employment matters, governmental claims for taxes or duties, and other disputes that arise in the ordinary course of the Company\u2019s business. In particular, the Company is subject to an investigation by the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement related to tax issues raised in the Company\u2019s October 22, 2012 Form 8-K, and the SEC filed a proof of claim against the Company in the Bankruptcy Court in connection with that investigation. To the extent this claim is allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, the Equity Plan provides a maximum reserve of up to $5 million as the exclusive source from which to satisfy any liabilities on account of that claim. In the event that the SEC asserts separate claims against individuals affiliated with the Company, liabilities associated with such claims are not included in this reserve, and any such liabilities not covered by insurance may be subject to reimbursement by the Company, subject to the terms of the Equity Plan. Additionally, there are a number of pending lawsuits alleging injuries related to purported asbestos exposure in various state and federal courts, as well as certain proofs of claim alleging such exposure pending before the Bankruptcy Court. The Company believes it has insurance coverage for the majority, though not all, of these cases.\nAlthough the Company intends to defend these matters vigorously, it cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any such matter, and the ultimate outcome of these matters or the potential costs to resolve them could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to OSG\u2019s tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s future operating results, including profitability, cash flows, and financial condition. Insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases and/or insurers may not remain solvent which may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition. The Company\u2019s recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for its contingent liabilities are based on its assessment of potential liability using the information available to the Company at the time and, as applicable, any past experience and trends with respect to similar matters. However, because litigation is inherently uncertain, the Company\u2019s estimates for contingent liabilities may be insufficient to cover the actual liabilities from such claims, resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d and Note 21, \u201cContingencies,\u201d to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements included in \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statement and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nWe may be subject to claims that were not discharged in the Chapter 11 Petitions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability.\nSubstantially all of the claims against us that arose prior to our emergence from bankruptcy were resolved during our Chapter 11 Petitions or are in the process of being resolved in the Bankruptcy Court as part of the claims reconciliation process. Although we anticipate that the remaining claims will be handled in due course with no material adverse effect to our business, financial operations or financial conditions, we cannot assure you that this will be the case or that the resolution of such claims will occur in a timely manner or at all. Subject to certain exceptions, and as set forth in the Plan, all claims against and interests in us and our subsidiaries that filed for Chapter 11 and which arose prior to our emergence from bankruptcy are (1) subject to the compromise and/or treatment provided for in the Plan and/or (2) discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code, the terms of the Plan, and the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order confirming the Plan (the \u201cConfirmation Order\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan constitute a good faith compromise or settlement, or resolution of all such claims and the Confirmation Order, as well as other orders resolving objections to claims, constitute the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s approval of the compromise settlement, or resolution arrived at with respect to all such claims. Circumstances in which claims and other obligations that arose prior to our emergence from bankruptcy may not have been discharged include instances where the Plan provides for reinstatement of such claims, or where a claimant had inadequate notice of the bankruptcy filing. As such, some parties whose claims were expunged during the bankruptcy or discharged by the Plan and Confirmation Order may seek to re-assert their claims in state or federal court. While the terms of the Plan and the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s orders generally foreclose that reassertion, there are limited instances, such as where a court finds an insufficient notice of the bankruptcy, in which a plaintiff may be able to proceed despite an expungement or discharge. In that event, the continuation of such a lawsuit could have a material adverse effect.\n37 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nThe smuggling of drugs or other contraband onto the Company\u2019s vessels may lead to governmental claims against the Company.\t\nThe Company expects that its vessels will call in ports where smugglers attempt to hide drugs and other contraband on vessels, with or without the knowledge of crew members. To the extent the Company\u2019s vessels are found with contraband, whether inside or attached to the hull of our vessel and whether with or without the knowledge of any of its crew, we may face governmental or other regulatory claims which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMaritime claimants could arrest OSG\u2019s vessels, which could interrupt cash flows.\nCrew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of the Company\u2019s vessels could interrupt OSG\u2019s cash flow and require it to pay a significant amount of money to have the arrest lifted. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as South Africa, under the \u201csister ship\u201d theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the vessel that is subject to the claimant\u2019s maritime lien and any \u201cassociated\u201d vessel, meaning any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could try to assert \u201csister ship\u201d liability against one vessel in the Company\u2019s fleet for claims relating to another vessel in its fleet which, if successful, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s U.S. federal income tax position in respect of certain credit agreement borrowings used by OIN is not free from doubt.\nThe Company has taken the position that certain drawdowns by the Company under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility used solely by OIN should not be taken into account in determining amounts includible in OSG\u2019s income as deemed dividends under section 951(a)(1)(B) and section 956 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for taxable years 2013 and earlier. Although the Company believes that it has a strong basis for taking this position, there is no authority directly on point and the Company has established a reserve in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 740. If the IRS were to challenge the Company\u2019s position, the Company\u2019s total cash exposure could exceed the reserve, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company has recognized tax benefits but certain of these items may be subject to audit and material adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service.\nThe Company currently plans to treat certain payments made by Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. in connection with the Company\u2019s emergence from bankruptcy as having been made in its capacity as guarantor of the obligations of subsidiaries of OSG International, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company incorporated in the Marshall Islands, arising under certain loan agreements and deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. In connection with these payments, the Company has recorded a tax benefit; however, due to significant uncertainty as to whether the IRS will agree with the Company\u2019s position on the deductibility of those payments, or instead take the position that those payments gave rise to a non-deductible capital contribution, the Company has established a reserve in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 740 to fully offset the benefit. Certain of these items may be subject to audit and material adjustment by the IRS.\nTransfers or issuances of the Company\u2019s equity may impair or reduce the Company\u2019s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes in the future.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. An \u201cownership change\u201d is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50% of a corporation\u2019s stock over a rolling three-year period by stockholders that own (directly or indirectly) 5% or more of the stock of a corporation, or arising from a new issuance of stock by a corporation. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change NOLs, credits and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax exempt rate and the value of the company\u2019s stock immediately before the ownership change. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. In addition, Section 383 generally limits the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by pre-ownership change tax credit carryforwards. If the Company were to undergo an \u201cownership change,\u201d it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n38 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nOSG\u2019s financial condition would be materially adversely affected if the shipping income of OSG\u2019s foreign subsidiaries becomes subject to current taxation in the United States.\nAs a result of changes made by the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004 (\u201c2004 Act\u201d), the Company does not include in its U.S. tax return on a current basis the unrepatriated shipping income earned by its international flag vessels, which in recent years represented substantially all of the Company\u2019s pre-tax income. These changes in the 2004 Act were made to make U.S.-controlled shipping companies competitive with foreign-controlled shipping companies, which are generally incorporated in jurisdictions in which they either do not pay income taxes or pay minimal income taxes. The taxation of OSG\u2019s foreign subsidiaries under U.S. laws is a complex area and is subject to ongoing analysis and recalculation, which can have a material impact on the Company. See Note 13, \u201cTaxes,\u201d to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statement and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nThe President and several Congressmen and Senators have announced support for repealing certain tax provisions that purportedly incentivize companies to move jobs from the United States to foreign countries. While the Company believes that the changes made in the 2004 Act with respect to foreign shipping income do not \u201cincentivize moving jobs offshore,\u201d and, in fact, have enabled the Company to expand its U.S. Flag fleet and create jobs in the United States, Congress may decide to repeal the changes made in the 2004 Act with respect to taxation of foreign shipping income for the aforementioned reason or as part of initiatives to reduce the U.S. budget deficit or to reform the U.S. corporate tax regime. Such repeal, either directly or indirectly by limiting or reducing benefits received under the 2004 Act, could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial results and cash flows.\nRisks Related to the Common Stock and Warrants\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s securities may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s securities may fluctuate substantially. You may not be able to resell your Class A or Class B Common Stock or Class A or Class B Warrants at or above the price you paid for such securities due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. These risks include those described or referred to in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and under \u201cForward -Looking Statements,\u201d as well as, among other things: fluctuations in the Company\u2019s operating results; activities of and results of operations of the Company\u2019s competitors; changes in the Company\u2019s relationships with the Company\u2019s customers or the Company\u2019s vendors; changes in business or regulatory conditions; changes in the Company\u2019s capital structure; any announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic alliances or joint ventures; additions or departures of key personnel; investors\u2019 general perception of the Company; failure to meet market expectations; future sales of the Company\u2019s securities by it, directors, executives and significant stockholders; changes in domestic and international economic and political conditions; and other events or factors, including those resulting from natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock market has recently experienced volatility that, in some cases, has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s securities, regardless of its actual operating performance.\nThe Company\u2019s stock and warrants are thinly traded, and your ability to sell such securities may be limited.\nThe Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class A Warrants are currently traded as \u201crestricted securities\u201d in the over-the-counter market and in privately negotiated transactions among individual holders pursuant to exemptions from the Securities Act of 1933. Transactions are reported as taking place only sporadically. Certain broker-dealers report quotes for the purchase and sale of Class A Common Stock and Class A Warrants. While the Company intends to apply for listing of the Class A Common Stock and Class A Warrants on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) at such time as it meets the NYSE\u2019s listing requirements, the Company may not be able to qualify for listing, and a more liquid market may never be developed or maintained. The Company cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market that may develop for the Class A Common Stock and Class A Warrants, your ability to sell your Class A Common Stock and Class A Warrants or the price at which you would be able to sell such securities.\n39 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock is listed on NYSE MKT. However, trading volume has been relatively low. Low levels of liquidity may make it difficult for you to sell your Class B Common Stock at any particular time.\nThe exercise of outstanding warrants may result in substantial dilution to the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nAs of March 2, 2015, the Company had outstanding:\n\u00b7 210,145,872 Class A warrants with an exercise price of $0.01 per share exercisable into an aggregate of 209,715,245 shares of Class A common stock; and\n\u00b7 2,251,022 Class B warrants with an exercise price of $0.01 per share exercisable into an aggregate of 2,246,409 shares of Class B common stock.\nCollectively, if exercised, the shares of common stock underlying these warrants would represent approximately 40.3% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock following such exercise. Accordingly, any such exercise would result in substantial dilution to the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is subject to restrictions on foreign ownership, which could have a negative impact on the transferability of the Company\u2019s common stock, its liquidity and market value, and on a change of control of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws authorize its Board of Directors to establish with respect to any class or series of capital stock of the Company certain rules, policies and procedures, including procedures with respect to transfer of shares, to assist in monitoring and maintaining compliance with the Jones Act ownership restrictions. In order to provide a reasonable margin for compliance with the Jones Act, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors has determined that until further action by it, at least 77% (the \u201cMinimum Percentage\u201d) of the outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of the Company must be owned by U.S. Citizens. Moreover, the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws provide that any purported transfer of equity interests in the Company that caused the percentage of outstanding shares of a class of capital stock of the Company to fall below the Minimum Percentage will be ineffective to transfer the equity interests or any voting, dividend or other rights associated with such interests.\nThe percentage of U.S. citizenship ownership of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock fluctuates based on daily trading, and at times in the past has declined to the Minimum Percentage. At and during such time that the Minimum Percentage is reached with respect to outstanding shares of a class of the Company\u2019s stock, the Company is unable to issue any further shares of such class of common stock or approve transfers of such class of common stock to non-U.S. Citizens among other things. The existence and enforcement of these ownership restrictions could have an adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of the Company\u2019s equity securities. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the ownership restrictions could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s outstanding warrants are not subject to the above ownership restrictions, but the warrants include provisions limiting the right of non-U.S. Citizens to exercise warrants if the shares of common stock that would be issued upon exercise would cause the percentage of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock held by U.S. Citizens to decline below the Minimum Percentage.\nThe Company does not currently intend to pay cash dividends on its securities for the foreseeable future.\nThe Company currently does not intend to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Company\u2019s board of directors and will depend on, among other things, its results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law or the SEC and other factors that the Company\u2019s board of directors may deem relevant.\nSome provisions of Delaware law and the Company\u2019s governing documents could influence its ability to effect a change of control.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and contained in the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company. In addition, these provisions could make it more difficult to bring about a change in the composition of the Company\u2019s board of directors. For example, the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws:\n40 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\n\u00b7 give the sole ability to then-current members of its board of directors to fill a vacancy on the board of directors;\n\u00b7 require the affirmative vote of two-thirds or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of its capital stock in order to amend or repeal certain provisions of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws; and\n\u00b7 establish advance notice requirements for nomination for elections to its board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings\nThese and other provisions of the Company\u2019s organizational documents and Delaware law may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing changes of control or changes in management, even if such transactions or changes would have significant benefits for its stockholders. As a result, these provisions could limit the price some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nSeparately, the Company has elected to opt out of Section 203 (\u201cSection 203\u201d) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), which restricts certain business combinations between a Delaware corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d Accordingly, the Company will be able to enter into such transactions with its principal stockholders without complying with the requirements of Section 203. The election to opt out of Section 203 could deprive certain stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company, particularly if it enters into a transaction with an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d", "PERMNO": 51457, "SIC": 4412, "TIC": "OSG"}
