You should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report. If any of the following risks, or any risk described elsewhere in this Annual Report, actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In any such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect us.\nOPERATING RISKS\nOur operations are subject to operational hazards that could expose us to potentially significant losses.\nOur operations are subject to potential operational hazards and risks inherent in refining operations, in transporting and storing crude oil and refined products and in producing natural gas and oil. Any of these risks, such as fires, explosions, maritime disasters, security breaches, pipeline ruptures and spills, mechanical failure of equipment and severe weather and natural disasters at our or third-party facilities could result in business interruptions or shutdowns and damage to our properties and the properties of others. A serious accident at our facilities could also result in serious injury or death to our employees or contractors and could expose us to significant liability for personal injury claims and reputational risk. Any such event or unplanned shutdown could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe volatility of crude oil prices and refined product prices and changes in the demand for such products, may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations.\nEarnings and cash flows from our refining segment depend on a number of factors, including to a large extent the cost of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks which has fluctuated significantly in recent years. While prices for refined products are influenced by the price of crude oil, the constantly changing margin between the price we pay for crude oil and other refinery feedstocks and the prices we receive for refined products (\u201ccrack spread\u201d) also fluctuates significantly. These prices we pay and prices we receive depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the global supply and demand for crude oil, gasoline and other refined products, which are subject to, among other things:\n\u2022\nchanges in the global economy and the level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil and refined products;\n\u2022\navailability of crude oil and refined products and the infrastructure to transport crude oil and refined products;\n\u2022\nlocal factors, including market conditions, the level of operations of other refineries in our markets and the volume and price of refined products imported;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual terrorist incidents, acts of war and other global political conditions;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulations; and\n\u2022\nweather conditions, hurricanes or other natural disasters.\nIn addition, we purchase our refinery feedstocks before manufacturing and selling the refined products. Price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the manufactured refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant impact on our financial results. We also purchase refined products manufactured by others for sale to our customers. Price level changes during the periods between purchasing and selling these refined products could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investment in Laramie Energy is also impacted by changing commodity prices. Laramie Energy primarily sells natural gas and natural gas liquids, and adverse changes in those commodity prices would impact the value of our investment in Laramie Energy.\nInstability in the global economic and political environment can lead to volatility in the costs and availability of crude oil and prices for refined products, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nInstability in the global economic and political environment can lead to volatility in the costs and availability of crude oil, and in the prices for refined products. This may place downward pressure on our results of operations. This is particularly true of developments in and relating to oil-producing countries, including terrorist activities, military conflicts, embargoes, internal instability or actions or reactions of the U.S. or foreign governments in anticipation of, or in response to, such developments. Any such events may limit or disrupt markets, which could negatively impact our ability to access global crude oil commodity flows or sell our refined products.\nMany of our refined products could cause serious injury or death if mishandled or misused by us or our purchasers, or if defects occur during manufacturing.\nWhile we produce, store, transport and deliver all of our refined products in a safe manner, many of our refined products are highly flammable or explosive and could cause significant damage to persons or property if mishandled. Defects in our products (such as gasoline or jet fuel) or misuse by us or by end purchasers could lead to fatalities or serious damage to property. We may be held liable for such occurrences which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business is impacted by increased risks of spills, discharges or other releases of petroleum or hazardous substances in our refining and logistics operations and in third-party natural gas and oil production operations in which we have a working interest.\nThe operation of refineries, pipelines, and refined products terminals and the production of natural gas and oil is subject to increased risks of spills, discharges or other inadvertent releases of petroleum or hazardous substances. These events could occur in connection with the operation of our refinery, pipelines or refined products terminals, or in connection with our Texadian business, or third-party drilling and production activities in which we have a working interest or at third party facilities that receive our wastes or by-products for treatment or disposal. If any of these events occur, or is found to have previously occurred, we could be liable for costs and penalties associated with their remediation under federal, state and local environmental laws or common law, and could be liable for property damage to third parties caused by contamination from releases and spills. The penalties and clean-up costs that we may have to pay for releases or the amounts that we may have to pay to third parties for damages to their property, could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe operate in and adjacent to environmentally sensitive coastal waters where tanker, pipeline, and refined product transportation and storage operations are closely regulated by federal, state and local agencies and monitored by environmental interest groups. Operations by third-party drilling and production entities in which we have a working interest that are adjacent to navigable waters such as rivers and lakes are similarly subject to stringent regulations. Transportation and storage of crude oil and refined products over and adjacent to regulated waters involves increased risk subjecting us to the provisions of the federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (\u201cOPA\u201d), and state laws in Hawaii and Colorado. Among other things, these laws require us and the owners of tankers that we charter to deliver crude oil to our refinery to demonstrate in some situations the capacity to respond to a spill of up to one million barrels of oil from a tanker and up to 600,000 barrels of oil from an above ground storage tank adjacent to water, which we refer to as a \u201cWorst Case Discharge,\u201d to the maximum extent possible.\nWe and third-party drilling and production entities in which we have a working interest and the owners of tankers we charter have contracted with various spill response service companies in the areas in which we transport and store crude oil and refined products to meet the requirements of the OPA and applicable state and foreign laws. However, there may be accidents involving tankers, pipelines, railcars or above ground storage tanks transporting or storing crude oil or refined products, and response services may not respond to a Worst Case Discharge in a manner that will adequately contain that discharge, or we may be subject to liability in connection with any unauthorized discharge. Additionally, we cannot ensure that all resources of a contracted response service company could be available for our or a chartered tanker owner\u2019s use at any given time. There are many factors that could inhibit the availability of these resources, including, but not limited to, weather conditions, governmental regulations or moratoria or other global events. State or federal rulings could require that these resources could be diverted to respond to other events.\nOur operations, including the operation of underground storage tanks, are also subject to the risk of environmental litigation and investigations which could affect our results of operations.\nFrom time to time we have been and presently are, subject to litigation and investigations with respect to environmental and related matters. We may become involved in further litigation or other proceedings, or we may be held responsible in any existing or future litigation or proceedings, the costs of which could be material.\nWe operate and have in the past operated retail stations with underground storage tanks in Hawaii used primarily for storing and dispensing refined fuels. In addition, some of our retail stations have been owned by third parties whose operation of the stations was not under our control.\nFederal and state regulations and legislation govern the storage tanks and compliance with these requirements can be costly. The operation of underground storage tanks poses certain risks, including leaks. Leaks from underground storage tanks, which may occur at one or more of our retail stations, may impact soil or groundwater and could result in fines or civil liability for us.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from the liabilities that could arise in our business.\nWe carry property, casualty, business interruption and other lines of insurance but we do not maintain insurance coverage against all potential losses. Marine vessel charter agreements do not include indemnity provisions for oil spills so we also carry marine charterer\u2019s liability insurance. We could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. Claims covered by insurance are subject to deductibles, the aggregate amount of which could be material. Insurance policies are also subject to compliance with certain conditions, the failure of which could lead to a denial of coverage as to a particular claim or the voiding of a particular insurance policy. There also can be no assurance that existing insurance coverage can be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or that available coverage will be adequate to cover future claims. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance or failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third-party transportation of crude oil and refined products.\nOur refinery receives its crude oil via tankers and transports refined products from Oahu to Hawaii, Maui, Molokai and Kauai via barge. In addition to environmental risks, we could experience an interruption of supply or an increased cost to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of accidents, governmental regulation or third-party action. A prolonged disruption of the ability of a pipeline or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business and the failure of any critical information system, including a cyber security breach, may result in harm to our business.\nWe are heavily dependent on our technology infrastructure and maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. These information systems include data network and telecommunications, internet access and our websites and various computer hardware equipment and software applications, including those that are critical to the safe operation of our refinery and our pipelines and terminals. These information systems are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters, software viruses or other malware, power failures, cyber attacks and other events. To the extent that these information systems are under our control, we have implemented measures such as virus protection software and intrusion detection systems, to address the outlined risks. However, security measures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe. Any compromise of our data security or our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business and subject us to additional costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Finally, federal legislation relating to cyber security threats could impose additional requirements on our operations.\nThrough Laramie Energy, we are subject to all the risks of natural gas and oil exploration and production.\nThrough our investment in Laramie Energy and to a lesser extent, through our other non-operated properties, we are exposed to all the risks inherent in natural gas and oil exploration and production, including the risks that:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to replace production with new reserves;\n\u2022\nexploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves;\n\u2022\ntitle to properties in which we or Laramie Energy has an interest may be impaired by title defects;\n\u2022\nthe marketability of our natural gas products depends mostly on the availability, proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities, which are owned by third parties;\n\u2022\nwe have no long-term contracts to sell natural gas or oil;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental requirements could result in increased costs of operation or curtailment, delay or cancellation of development and producing operations;\n\u2022\nfederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays;\n\u2022\nchanges in the demand for natural gas and oil could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022\nnatural gas drilling and production operations require adequate sources of water to facilitate the fracturing process and the disposal of that water when it flows back to the wellbore. If we are unable to obtain adequate water supplies and dispose of the water we use or remove at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules, our ability to produce natural gas commercially and in commercial quantities would be impaired.\nWe cannot control activities on properties we do not operate and we are unable to ensure the proper operation and profitability of these non-operated properties.\nWe are a non-operator with respect to our natural gas and oil properties. Consequently, we have limited ability to exercise influence over and control the risks associated with, the operation of these properties. The success and timing of leasehold acquisition, drilling and development activities therefore will depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\ntiming and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nexpertise and diligence in adequately performing operations and complying with applicable agreements;\n\u2022\nfinancial resources;\n\u2022\ninclusion of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u2022\nuse of technology.\nWe also own the equivalent of a 6.07% gross working interest in the Point Arguello Unit and related facilities located offshore California (the \"Point A Unit\"). We do not operate the Point A Unit, but may nevertheless be responsible for certain costs, including costs related to environmental compliance, associated with the Point A Unit due to our ownership interest.\nAs a result of any of the above, or any other failure of the operator to act in ways that are in our best interest, our results of operations and financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to extract value from our investment in Laramie Energy is limited.\nOur 32.4% ownership interest in Laramie Energy is a significant asset. However, the ability of Laramie Energy to make distributions to its owners, including us, is currently prohibited by the terms of the Laramie Energy Credit Facility. In addition, Laramie, which currently has a 52.4% ownership interest in Laramie Energy, controls most decisions affecting Laramie Energy\u2019s operations and we only have veto rights over decisions of Laramie Energy in a limited number of areas.\nInformation concerning our natural gas and oil reserves is uncertain.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and cash flows from such reserves, including factors beyond our control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of an estimate of quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves, or of cash flows attributable to such reserves, is a function of the available data, assumptions regarding future natural gas and crude oil prices, availability and terms of financing, expenditures for future development and exploitation activities and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Reserves and future cash flows may also be subject to material downward or upward revisions based upon production history, development and exploitation activities, natural gas and crude oil prices and regulatory changes. Actual future production, revenue, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, quantities of recoverable reserves and value of cash flows from those reserves may vary significantly from our assumptions and estimates. In addition, reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data. Further, the difficult financing environment may inhibit our ability to finance development of our reserves in the future.\nThe estimated quantities of proved reserves and the discounted present value of future net cash flows attributable to those reserves as of December 31, 2015 included herein were prepared by independent reserve engineers in accordance with the rules of the SEC and are not intended to represent the fair market value of such reserves. As required by the SEC, the estimated discounted present value of future net cash flows from proved reserves is generally based on prices and costs on the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. In addition, the 10% discount factor the SEC requires to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on the cost of capital in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business and the natural gas and oil industry in general.\nREGULATORY RISK\nMeeting the requirements of evolving environmental, health and safety laws and regulations including those related to climate change could adversely affect our performance.\nConsistent with the experience of other U.S. refiners, environmental laws and regulations have raised operating costs and may require significant capital investments at our refinery. We may be required to address conditions that may be discovered in the future and require a response. Also, potentially material expenditures could be required in the future as a result of evolving environmental, health and safety and energy laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Future developments in federal and state laws and regulations governing environmental, health and safety and energy matters are especially difficult to predict.\nPrior to our acquisition of PHR, Tesoro was engaged in negotiations with the EPA regarding a Consent Decree related to all of Tesoro\u2019s refining assets, including PHR. While Tesoro has agreed to reimburse us for capital expenditures arising from the Consent Decree, we will continue to be initially liable for capital expenditures and will be responsible for any operational expense increases brought about by the Consent Decree.\nCurrently, multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address GHG emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of consideration, promulgation or implementation. These include actions to develop national, statewide or regional programs, each of which could require reductions in our GHG emissions. Requiring reductions in our GHG emissions could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls at our facilities and/or (iii) administer and manage any GHG emissions programs, including acquiring emission credits or allotments.\nRequiring reductions in our GHG emissions and increased use of renewable fuels which can be supplied by producers and marketers in other industries that supply alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial, commercial and individual customers could also decrease the demand for our refined products and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRenewable fuels mandates may reduce demand for the petroleum fuels we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition.\nThe EPA has issued Renewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) mandates, requiring refiners such as us to blend renewable fuels into the petroleum fuels they produce and sell in the U.S. We, and other refiners subject to RFS, may meet the RFS requirements by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels produced by us or purchased from third parties. To the extent that refiners will not or cannot blend renewable fuels into the products they produce in the quantities required to satisfy their obligations under the RFS program, those refiners must purchase renewable credits, referred to as renewable identification numbers (\u201cRINs\u201d), to maintain compliance. To the extent that we exceed the minimum volumetric requirements for blending of renewable fuels, we generate our own RINs for which we have the option of retaining the RINs for current or future RFS compliance or selling those RINs on the open market.\nUnder the RFS program, the volume of renewable fuels that obligated parties are required to blend into their finished petroleum fuels increases annually over time until 2022. Our refinery is subject to compliance with the RFS mandates. On November 30, 2015, the EPA issued final volume mandates for the years 2014 through 2016, which are generally lower than the corresponding statutory mandates for those years.\nExisting laws, regulations or regulatory initiatives could change and, notwithstanding that the EPA\u2019s proposed volume mandates for 2014 through 2016 are generally lower than the corresponding statutory mandate for those years, the final minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum fuels could increase in the future. Despite a decline in RINs prices from relatively higher levels observed during mid-2013, we cannot currently predict the future prices of RINs and, thus, the expenses related to acquiring RINs in the future could increase relative to the cost in prior years. Any increase in the final minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum fuels, and/or any increase in the cost to acquire RINs has the potential to result in significant costs in connection with RINs compliance for 2014 and future years, which costs could be material and may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Finally, while there is no current regulatory standard that authenticates RINs that may be purchased on the open market from third parties, we believe that the RINs we purchase are from reputable sources, are valid and serve to demonstrate compliance with applicable RFS requirements.\nPotential legislative and regulatory actions addressing climate change could increase our costs, reduce our revenue and cash flow from natural gas and oil sales or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business.\nThe EPA has issued a notice of finding and determination that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (\u201cGHG\u201d) present an endangerment to human health and the environment. In response, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act (the \u201cCAA\u201d) that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) construction and Title V operating permit program requiring reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions will also be required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards, which will be established by the states or, in some instances, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, on December 23, 2010, the EPA entered a settlement agreement with environmental groups requiring the agency to propose by December 10, 2011 GHG New Source Performance Standards (\u201cNSPS\u201d) for refineries and to finalize these rules by November 15, 2012. To date, the EPA has not completed those rulemakings, and we do not know when they will be completed. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the U.S., including petroleum refineries and certain onshore petroleum and natural gas production activities, on an annual basis. We monitor for GHG emissions at our refinery, and believe we are in substantial compliance with the applicable\nGHG reporting requirements. Certain of the third-party drilling and production entities in which we hold a working interest also may be subject to reporting of GHG emissions in the U.S. These EPA policies and rulemakings could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified facilities.\nIn addition, from time to time, the U.S. Congress has considered, and may in the future consider and adopt \u201ccap and trade\u201d legislation that would establish an economy-wide cap on GHG emissions in the U.S. and would require most sources of GHG emissions to obtain emission \u201callowances\u201d corresponding to their annual GHG emissions. For those GHG sources that are unable to meet the required limitations, such legislation could impose substantial financial burdens. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce GHG emissions would likely require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our production. The adoption of any legislation or regulations that limits emissions of GHG from our or such drilling and production entities\u2019 facilities, equipment and operations could require us or such entities to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHG associated with our or such entities operations or could adversely affect demand for the refined petroleum products that we produce or the crude oil or natural gas that such drilling and production entities in which we hold a working interest produce. For example, the EPA proposed in the summer of 2015 and is expected to finalize in 2016 new regulations that will set methane emission standards for new and modified oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities as part of the Administration\u2019s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45% from 2012 levels by 2025. Such regulations, if adopted, could increase costs of oil and natural gas operators, including Laramie Energy, in whom we have a non-operating working interest. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG in the earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations as well as on third-party drilling and production activities in which we have a non-operating working interest.\nThe adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to manage risks associated with our businesses and increase the working capital requirements to conduct these activities.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law in July 2010, provides for new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions, including oil and natural gas derivative transactions. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for the creation of position limits for certain derivatives transactions, as well as requiring certain transactions to be cleared on exchanges for which cash collateral will be required. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC, the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. In October 2011, the CFTC approved final rules that established position limits for futures contracts on 28 physical commodities. These initial CFTC position limits rules were vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2012. However, in November 2013, the CFTC proposed new rules that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.\nIt is not possible at this time to predict with certainty the full effect of the Dodd-Frank Act and CFTC rules on us and the timing of such effects. The Dodd-Frank Act may require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements if we do not satisfy certain specific exceptions. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception to the clearing, trade execution and margin requirements for swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks, the application of the requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of our derivatives. Depending on the rules adopted by the CFTC or similar rules that may be adopted by other regulatory bodies, we might in the future be required to provide cash collateral for our commodities derivative transactions under circumstances in which we do not currently post cash collateral. Posting of such additional cash collateral could impact liquidity and reduce our cash available for capital expenditures. A requirement to post cash collateral could therefore reduce our ability to execute transactions to reduce commodity price uncertainty and thus protect cash flows.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory requirements upon our business will not be known until all of the regulations are implemented. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices.\nIn addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.\nBUSINESS RISKS\nThe location of our refinery and related assets in the Hawaiian Islands creates an exposure to the risks of the local economy in which we operate and other local adverse conditions. The location of our refinery also creates the risk of lower margins should the supply/demand balance change in the Hawaiian Islands requiring that we deliver refined products to customers outside of the region.\nBecause our refinery is located in Hawaii, we primarily market our refined products in the Hawaiian Islands, which is a relatively limited geographic area. As a result, we are more susceptible to regional economic conditions than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors and any unforeseen events or circumstances that affect our operating area could also materially adversely affect our revenues and our business and operating results. These factors include, among other things, changes in the economy, weather conditions, demographics and population, increased supply of refined products from competitors and reductions in the supply of crude oil.\nShould the supply and demand balance shift in Hawaii, resulting in supply on the islands exceeding demand, we may have to deliver refined products to customers off-island. These sales generally result in lower margins to us relative to on-island sales given the higher cost of freight and typically lower price points.\nWe must make substantial capital expenditures at our refinery and related assets to maintain their reliability and efficiency. If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs or in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur refinery and related assets have been in operation for many years. Equipment, even if properly maintained, may require significant capital expenditures and expenses to keep it operating at optimum efficiency. These costs do not result in increases in unit capacities, but rather are focused on trying to maintain safe, reliable operations.\nDelays or cost increases related to the engineering, procurement and construction of new facilities, or improvements and repairs to our existing facilities and equipment, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors in the marketplace, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ndenial or delay in obtaining regulatory approvals and/or permits;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in executing the capital projects mandated by the consent decree currently being negotiated by Tesoro;\n\u2022\nunplanned increases in the cost of equipment, materials or labor;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in transportation of equipment and materials;\n\u2022\nsevere adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of our vendors and suppliers;\n\u2022\nshortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages;\n\u2022\nmarket-related increases in a project's debt or equity financing costs; and/or\n\u2022\nnon-performance or force majeure by, or disputes with, our vendors, suppliers, contractors or sub-contractors.\nAny one or more of these occurrences noted above could have a significant impact on our business. If we were unable to make up the delays or to recover the related costs, or if market conditions change, it could materially and adversely affect our financial position, or results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are particularly vulnerable to disruptions to our refining operations because our refining operations are concentrated in one facility, which is scheduled for a maintenance turnaround during 2016 that will involve significant expenditures.\nBecause all of our refining operations are concentrated in the Kapolei refinery, a significant disruption at the Kapolei facility could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our refining segment comprised approximately 91.7% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe expect to perform a significant maintenance turnaround at the Kapolei refinery during 2016, which will involve anticipated expenditures of $30 to $35 million. All or a portion of our refinery's production may be halted or disrupted during the turnaround and the turnaround, if unsuccessful or delayed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, the Kapolei refinery may require additional unscheduled down time for unanticipated maintenance or repairs that are more frequent than our scheduled turnarounds. Refinery operations may also be disrupted by external factors such as a suspension of feedstock deliveries or an interruption of electricity, natural gas, water treatment or other utilities. Other potentially disruptive factors include natural disasters, severe weather conditions, workplace or environmental accidents, interruptions of\nsupply, work stoppages, losses of permits or authorizations or acts of terrorism. Disruptions to our refining operations could reduce our revenues during the period of time that our processing units are not operating.\nIf we are unable to obtain our crude oil supply without the benefit of our supply and offtake agreements with J. Aron, the capital required to finance our crude oil supply could negatively impact our liquidity.\nAll of the crude oil delivered at our refinery is subject to our supply and offtake agreements with J. Aron. If we are unable to obtain our crude oil supply outside these agreements, our exposure to crude oil pricing risks may increase as the number of days between when we pay for the crude oil and when the crude oil is delivered to us increases. Such increased exposure could negatively impact our liquidity position due to the increase in working capital used to acquire crude oil inventory for our refinery.\nOur arrangement with J. Aron exposes us to J. Aron related credit and performance risk.\nWe have supply and offtake agreements with J. Aron, pursuant to which J. Aron will intermediate crude oil supplies and refined product inventories at our refinery. J. Aron will own all of the crude oil in our tanks and substantially all of our refined product inventories prior to our sale of the inventories. Upon termination of the supply and offtake agreements, which may be terminated by J. Aron as early as May 31, 2018, we are obligated to repurchase all crude oil and refined product inventories then owned by J. Aron and located at the specified storage facilities at then current market prices. Relying on J. Aron\u2019s ability to honor its supply and offtake obligations exposes us to J. Aron\u2019s credit and business risks. An adverse change in J. Aron\u2019s business, results of operations, liquidity or financial condition could adversely affect its ability to perform its obligations, which could consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or liquidity and, as a result, our business and operating results. In addition, we may be required to use substantial capital to repurchase crude oil and refined product inventories from J. Aron upon termination of the agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur retail business is vulnerable to risks including changes in consumer preferences and economic conditions, competitive environment, supplier concentration and other trends and factors that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur retail business is subject to changes in consumer preferences, national, regional and local economic conditions, demographic trends and consumer confidence in the economy. Factors such as traffic patterns, weather conditions, local demographics and the number and locations of competing retail service stations and convenience stores also affect the performance of our retail stores. Adverse changes in any of these trends or factors could reduce our retail customer traffic or sales, or impose limits on our pricing that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCyber security risks, or the failure to maintain the integrity of the data we collect, could expose us to data loss, potential litigation liability and harm to our reputation.\nOur retail business collects certain customer data, including credit card numbers, for business purposes. We also maintain certain information about our employees that may be personally identifiable. The integrity and protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical to our business and our customers and employees have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment, as well as the requirements imposed on us related to information protection, data security and privacy laws are increasingly demanding and continue to evolve. Maintaining compliance with applicable regulations could increase our operating expenses. Furthermore, a penetrated or compromised data system or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of customer, employee or company data, which could harm our reputation, disrupt our operations, or result in fines, lawsuits, or other costs.\nWe cannot be certain that our net operating loss tax carryforwards will continue to be available to offset our tax liability.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we estimated that we had approximately $1.4 billion of net operating loss tax carryforwards (\"NOLs\"). In order to utilize the NOLs, we must generate taxable income that can offset such carryforwards. The availability of NOLs to offset taxable income would be substantially reduced or eliminated if we were to undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). We will be treated as having had an \u201cownership change\u201d if there is more than a 50% increase in stock ownership during any three year \u201ctesting period\u201d by \u201c5% shareholders.\u201d\nIn order to help us preserve our NOLs, our certificate of incorporation contains stock transfer restrictions designed to reduce the risk of an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 of the Code. We expect that the restrictions will remain in place for the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you, however, that these restrictions will prevent an ownership change.\nThe NOLs will expire in various amounts, if not used, between 2027 through 2033. The Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) has not audited any of our tax returns for any of the years during the carryforward period including those returns for the years in\nwhich the losses giving rise to the NOLs were reported. We cannot assure you that we would prevail if the IRS were to challenge the availability of the NOLs. If the IRS were successful in challenging our NOLs, all or some portion of the NOLs would not be available to offset any future consolidated income which would negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nInadequate liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business operations in the future.\nIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our obligations, we may be forced to reduce our capital expenditures, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be affected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our liquidity is constrained by our need to satisfy our obligations under our credit agreements and our supply and offtake agreements. The availability of capital when the need arises will depend upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include general economic and financial market conditions, the crack spread, natural gas and crude oil prices, our credit ratings, interest rates, market perceptions of us or the industries in which we operate, our market value and our operating performance. We may be unable to execute our long-term operating strategy if we cannot obtain capital from these or other sources when the need arises.\nOur ability to generate cash and repay our indebtedness or fund capital expenditures depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to fund future capital expenditures and repay our indebtedness when due will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, borrowings under our credit agreements and distributions from our subsidiaries. To a certain extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory conditions and other factors that are beyond our control, including the crack spread and the prices we receive for our natural gas and crude oil production.\nWe cannot assure you that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that our subsidiaries can or will make sufficient distributions to us or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to repay our indebtedness or fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our needs, we may be forced to reduce our planned capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be affected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and could impair our liquidity.\nCovenants in our existing debt agreements limit our ability to undertake certain types of transactions and may limit our ability to extract value from our subsidiaries.\nOur existing credit agreements contain certain negative covenants that limit our ability to undertake certain types of transactions, as well as restrictive financial covenants that require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. We may have to modify or curtail some of our operations to maintain compliance with the covenants in these agreements. These covenants may also limit our ability to extract value from our operating subsidiaries. A violation of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements, which could permit our lenders to accelerate the repayment of any borrowings then outstanding. A default or acceleration under our credit agreements would result in increased capital costs and could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our results of operations and our financial condition.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nWe have and will continue to have, a significant amount of indebtedness. Our obligation to repay our existing indebtedness will limit our ability to use our capital for other purposes. We may also incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, or issue preferred stock in order to maintain adequate liquidity and develop our businesses to the extent desired. A higher level of indebtedness and/or the issuance of preferred stock would increase the risk that we may default on our obligations. Our ability to meet our indebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic conditions, the crack spread, natural gas and crude oil prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of securities or a refinancing of our indebtedness include financial market conditions, the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital.\nWe may incur losses and incur additional costs as a result of our forward-contract activities and derivative transactions.\nWe enter into derivative contracts from time to time primarily to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and in the price of crude oil. If the instruments we use to hedge our exposure are not effective, or if our counterparties are unable to satisfy their obligations to us, we may incur losses. The risk of counterparty default is heightened in a poor economic environment. We may also be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent such regulation is applicable to us. Additionally, our commodity derivative activities and hedges may produce significant period-to-period earnings volatility that is not necessarily reflective of our underlying operational performance.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nWe will be subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under certain of our credit facilities, which bear interest at variable rates. Interest rate changes will not affect the market value of indebtedness incurred under such facilities, but could affect the amount of our interest payments and accordingly, our future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. A significant increase in prevailing interest rates that results in a substantial increase in the interest rates applicable to our indebtedness could substantially increase our interest expense and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely impact our ability to incur indebtedness for acquisitions or other purposes.\nWe have historically incurred indebtedness to fund our acquisitions and other working capital needs. Interest rates may increase in the future and, as a result, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. A rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact, as a result of such increased financing costs, on our ability to incur indebtedness for acquisitions or other purposes.\nWe may be unable to successfully identify, execute or effectively integrate future acquisitions which may negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe will continue to pursue acquisitions in the future. Although we regularly engage in discussions with and submit proposals to, acquisition candidates, suitable acquisitions may not be available in the future on reasonable terms. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may be unable to successfully negotiate the terms of an acquisition, finance the acquisition or, if the acquisition occurs, effectively integrate the acquired business into our existing businesses. Negotiations of potential acquisitions and the integration of acquired business operations may require a disproportionate amount of management\u2019s attention and our resources. Even if we complete additional acquisitions, continued acquisition financing may not be available or available on reasonable terms, any new businesses may not generate the anticipated level of revenues, the anticipated cost efficiencies or synergies may not be realized and these businesses may not be integrated successfully or operated profitably. Our inability to successfully identify, execute or effectively integrate future acquisitions may negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to compete effectively with larger companies for acquisitions, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe industries in which we operate are intensely competitive and we compete with other companies that have greater resources than we have. Our ability to acquire additional businesses or properties in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable businesses or properties for acquisition and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Many of our larger competitors have refining operations and market petroleum and other products and explore for and produce natural gas and crude oil, on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for acquisition targets, or evaluate or bid for and purchase a greater number of acquisition targets than our resources permit. Our inability to compete effectively with larger companies for acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered when determining if the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a significant decline in our expected future cash flows or a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization.\nAs a result of our acquisitions, we have significant goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet. In addition, significant negative industry or economic trends, such as those that have occurred as a result of the recent economic downturn, including reduced estimates of future cash flows or disruptions to our business could indicate that goodwill or intangible assets might be impaired. If, in any period our stock price decreases to the point where our market capitalization is less than our book value, this too could indicate a potential impairment and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on projections of future operating performance. We operate in highly competitive environments and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. As a result, we may incur substantial impairment charges to earnings in our financial statements should an impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets be determined resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our refining workforce is unionized and we may face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 744 people, with a collective bargaining agreement covering about 147 of those employees. The union ratified a four-year extension of the collective bargaining agreement on March 23, 2015. On January 13, 2016, a claim against us was brought to the United States National Labor Relations Board alleging a refusal to bargain collectively and in good faith. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent a strike or work stoppage in the future and any such work stoppage could cause disruptions in our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our companies have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nAdverse changes in global economic conditions and the demand for transportation fuels may impact our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.\nThe economic recovery from the recent recession continues to be tenuous and the risk of further significant global economic downturn continues. Further prolonged downturns or failure to recover could result in declines in consumer and business confidence and spending as well as increased unemployment and reduced demand for transportation fuels. This continues to adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate. These conditions increase the risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers, customers and business partners. The consequences of such adverse effects could include interruptions or delays in our suppliers\u2019 performance of our contracts, reductions and delays in customer purchases, delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products and bankruptcy of customers. Any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability and financial condition.\nAdverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us.\nWe may be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of its merits, litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to the company\u2019s operations and may cause significant expenditures and diversion of management attention. We may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could materially adversely affect our business operations or materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations should we fail to prevail in certain matters.\nCompetition from integrated national and international oil companies that produce their own supply of feedstocks, from importers of refined products and from high volume retailers and large convenience store retailing operators who may have greater financial resources, could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe compete with a number of integrated national and international oil companies who produce crude oil, some of which is used in their refining operations. Unlike these oil companies, we must purchase all of our crude oil from unaffiliated sources. Because these oil companies benefit from increased commodity prices and have greater access to capital and have stronger capital structures, they are able to better withstand poor and volatile market conditions, such as a lower refining margin environment, shortages of crude oil and other feedstocks or extreme price fluctuations.\nWe also face strong competition in the fuel and convenience store retailing market for the sale of retail gasoline and convenience store merchandise. Our competitors include service stations operated by integrated major oil companies and well-\nrecognized national high volume retailers or regional large chain convenience store operators, often selling gasoline or merchandise at aggressively competitive prices.\nSome of these competitors may have access to greater financial resources, which may provide them with a better ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry. Fundamental changes in the supply dynamics of foreign product imports could lead to reduced margins for the refined products we market, which could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nBecause we have no near term plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the near term. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors considers relevant.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe price of our common stock historically has been volatile. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell your common stock.\nThe market price for our common stock has varied between a high of $28.31 on November 20, 2015 and a low of $15.80 on January 5, 2015 during the year ended December 31, 2015. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell your common stock. Our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors; variations in our quarterly operating results from our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors; downward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates; and announcement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments.\nThe market for our common stock has been historically illiquid, which may affect your ability to sell your shares.\nThe volume of trading in our common stock has historically been low. In addition, a substantial amount of our common stock is held by two investors who have restrictions on their ability to sell the stock. The lack of substantial liquidity can adversely affect the price of our stock at a time when you might want to sell your shares. There is no guarantee that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or be maintained on the NYSE MKT, or that the volume of trading will be sufficient to allow for timely trades. Investors may not be able to sell their shares quickly or at the latest market price if trading in our stock is not active or if trading volume is limited. In addition, if trading volume in our common stock is limited, trades of relatively small numbers of shares may have a disproportionate effect on the market price of our common stock.\nDelaware law, our charter documents and concentrated stock ownership may impede or discourage a takeover, which could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. For example, the change in ownership limitations contained in Article 11 of our certificate of incorporation could have the effect of discouraging or impeding an unsolicited takeover proposal. In addition, our board of directors or a committee thereof has the power, without stockholder approval, to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock. The ability of our board of directors or a committee thereof to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nZell Credit Opportunities Master Fund, L.P. (\u201cZCOF\u201d) and Whitebox Advisors, LLC (\u201cWhitebox\u201d), together with their respective affiliates, each own or have the right to acquire as of February 16, 2016 approximately 32.4% and 23.7%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock. The level of their combined ownership of shares of our common stock could have the effect of discouraging or impeding an unsolicited acquisition proposal.\nWe may issue preferred stock with terms that could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the residual value of the common stock.\nWe may issue shares of common stock in satisfaction of general unsecured claims from our predecessor\u2019s bankruptcy that would dilute your ownership of our common stock.\nIn December 2011 and January 2012, Delta Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, and in March 2012, obtained approval from the bankruptcy court to proceed with a plan of reorganization. Pursuant to this plan, among other things, certain allowed general unsecured claims may be paid with shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2015, 12 claims totaling approximately $23.1 million remain to be resolved and we have reserved approximately $1.1 million representing the estimated value of claims remaining to be settled which are deemed probable and estimable at period end. The settlement of claims is subject to ongoing litigation and we are unable to predict with certainty how many shares will be required to satisfy all claims. Pursuant to the plan of reorganization, allowed claims are settled at a ratio of 54.4 shares per $1,000 of claim. Any issuances by us of common stock to satisfy claims would have a dilutive impact on the ownership interest of existing common stockholders and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nFuture sales of our common stock could reduce our stock price and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock, including shares issuable pursuant to securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. We have approximately 41.1 million shares of common stock outstanding as of February 26, 2016.\nSubject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions and the requirements of Rule 144 of the Securities Act, shares of our common stock registered under our equity incentive plan are available for resale immediately in the public market without restriction. In addition, subject to the change in ownership limitations contained in Article 11 of our certificate of incorporation and the requirements of Rule 144, up to 24,204,391 shares of our common stock registered under our registration statement on Form S-3 filed on June 1, 2015 are available for resale immediately in the public market without restriction, including 345,135 shares of our common stock that are issuable upon the exercise of common stock warrants at a nominal price.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares\nissued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nRISK RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS\nAcquisitions may prove to be worth less than we paid because of uncertainties in evaluating potential liabilities.\nWe expect acquisitions to be instrumental to our future growth. Successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of potential unknown and contingent liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. In connection with our assessments, we perform due diligence reviews of acquired companies and their businesses that we believe are generally consistent with industry practices. However, such reviews will not reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition, our reviews may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with potential environmental problems or other contingent and unknown liabilities that may exist or arise. As a result, there may be unknown and contingent liabilities related to acquired businesses of which we are unaware. We could be liable for unknown obligations relating to acquisitions for which indemnification is not available, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe representations, warranties and indemnification obligations of Mid Pac in the merger agreement are limited; as a result, the assumptions on which our estimates of future results contemplated by the merger agreement have been based may prove to be incorrect in a number of material ways, resulting in our not realizing the expected benefits of the Mid Pac acquisition\nThe representations and warranties of Mid Pac contained in the merger agreement are limited. In addition, the agreement provides limited indemnities. As a result, the assumptions on which our estimates of future results of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement have been based may prove to be incorrect in a number of material ways and we may not have an adequate remedy under the merger agreement. Consequently, we may not realize the expected benefits of the Mid Pac acquisition.", "PERMNO": 79259, "SIC": 2911, "TIC": "PARR"}
