{"cik": "1089819", "company": "CLECO CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Registrants.\nAgreement and Plan of Merger\nCleco Partners and Cleco may be unable to obtain the required governmental, regulatory, and other approvals required to complete the Merger, or such approvals may require Cleco to comply with material restrictions or conditions.\nConsummation of the Merger remains subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified closing conditions, including (i) the absence of any temporary restraining order or injunction preventing, prohibiting, restraining, enjoining, or rendering illegal the consummation of the Merger; (ii) approval from the LPSC; and (iii) other customary closing conditions. On February 24, 2016, the LPSC denied Cleco Power\u2019s application to approve the Merger. Consequently, LPSC approval required to consummate the Merger may not be obtained at all, may not be obtained on the proposed terms and schedules as contemplated by the parties, and/or may impose terms, conditions, obligations, or commitments that constitute a \u201cburdensome effect\u201d (as defined in the Merger Agreement). In the event that the LPSC approval includes any such burdensome effect or if any of the conditions to the closing are not satisfied prior to the termination date specified in the Merger Agreement, Cleco Partners will not be obligated to consummate the Merger. These conditions could delay or have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nIn the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the completion of the Merger, Cleco could incur significant transaction costs that could materially impact its financial performance and results of operations.\nCleco will incur significant transaction costs, including legal, accounting, financial advisory, filing, printing, and other costs relating to the Merger. The Merger Agreement provides that upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain specified circumstances, Cleco will be required to pay Cleco Partners a termination fee of $120.0 million. Any fees due as a result of termination could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCleco will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending that could adversely affect Cleco\u2019s financial results.\nUncertainty about the effects of the Merger on employees or vendors and others may have an adverse effect on Cleco. These uncertainties may impair Cleco\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel and could cause vendors and others that deal with Cleco to seek to change existing business relationships. Employee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to the completion of the Merger, as current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Cleco. If key employees depart or fail to accept employment with Cleco or its subsidiaries due to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain\nwith Cleco, Cleco\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nCleco expects that matters relating to the Merger, and if the Merger closes, integration-related issues, will place a significant burden on management, employees, and internal resources, which could otherwise have been devoted to other business opportunities. The diversion of management\u2019s time on Merger-related issues could affect Cleco\u2019s financial results. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts Cleco and its subsidiaries, without Cleco Partners\u2019 consent, from taking specified actions until the Merger occurs or the Merger Agreement is terminated, including, without limitation: (i) making certain acquisitions and dispositions of assets or property; (ii) exceeding certain capital spending limits; (iii) incurring certain forms of indebtedness; (iv) issuing equity or equity equivalents; and (v) increasing the dividend rates on its stock. These restrictions may prevent Cleco from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities or making other changes to its business prior to consummation of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nCleco is subject to litigation related to the proposed Merger.\nIn connection with the proposed Merger, four actions were filed in the Ninth Judicial District Court for Rapides Parish, Louisiana and three actions were filed in the Civil District Court for Orleans Parish, Louisiana. One of the actions filed in Rapides Parish has been dismissed. The remaining three actions in Rapides Parish have been consolidated. The three actions in Orleans Parish have been transferred to Rapides Parish and consolidated with the other litigation in Rapides Parish. The actions were filed against Cleco Corporation and, among others, Cleco Partners, Merger Sub, and members of the Board of Directors of Cleco Corporation. The petitions generally allege, among other things, that the members of Cleco Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, conducting an allegedly inadequate sale process, agreeing to the Merger at a price that allegedly undervalues Cleco, and failing to disclose material information about the Merger. The petitions also allege that Cleco Partners, Cleco, and Merger Sub and, in some cases, certain of the investors in Cleco Partners, either aided and abetted or entered into a civil conspiracy to advance those supposed breaches of duty. The petitions seek various remedies, including an injunction against the Merger and monetary damages, including attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses.\nIt is possible that additional claims beyond those that have already been filed will be brought by the current plaintiffs or by others in an effort to enjoin the Merger or seek monetary relief from Cleco. Cleco is not able to predict the outcome of these actions, or others, nor can Cleco predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve the actions. An unfavorable resolution of any such litigation surrounding the proposed Merger could delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger. In addition, the cost to Cleco of defending the actions, even if resolved in Cleco\u2019s favor, could be substantial. Such actions could also divert the attention of Cleco\u2019s management and resources from day-to-day operations.\nCLECO CORPORATION\nCLECO POWER\n2015 FORM 10-K\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the market price of Cleco Corporation\u2019s common stock.\nFailure to complete the Merger may negatively impact the future trading price of Cleco Corporation\u2019s common stock. If the Merger is not completed, the market price of Cleco Corporation\u2019s common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of Cleco Corporation\u2019s stock reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. Additionally, if the Merger is not completed, Cleco will have incurred significant costs, as well as the diversion of the time and attention of management. A failure to complete the Merger may also result in negative publicity, litigation against Cleco or its directors and officers, and a negative impression of Cleco in the investment community. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, or stock price of Cleco Corporation.\nLPSC Audits\nThe LPSC conducts fuel audits that could result in Cleco Power making substantial refunds of previously recorded revenue.\nGenerally, fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered through the LPSC-established FAC, which enables Cleco Power to pass on to its customers substantially all such expenses. Recovery of FAC costs is subject to periodic fuel audits by the LPSC. The LPSC FAC General Order issued in November 1997 in Docket No. U-21497 provides that an audit will be performed at least every other year.\nOn February 3, 2016, the LPSC initiated an audit of Cleco Power\u2019s fuel and purchased power expenses for the period January 2014 through December 2015. The total amount of fuel expense included in this audit is $582.6 million. Management is unable to predict or give a reasonable estimate of the possible range of the disallowance, if any, related to this audit. If a disallowance of fuel costs is ordered, resulting in a refund, any such refund could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nThe LPSC conducts audits of environmental costs that could result in Cleco Power making substantial refunds of previously recorded revenue.\nIn July 2009, the LPSC issued Docket No. U-29380 Subdocket A, which provides for an EAC to recover from customers certain costs of environmental compliance. The costs eligible for recovery are prudently incurred air emissions credits associated with complying with federal, state, and local air emission regulations that apply to the generation of electricity reduced by the sale of such allowances. Also eligible for recovery are variable emission mitigation costs, which are the costs of reagents such as ammonia and limestone that are a part of the fuel mix used to reduce air emissions, among other things. Cleco Power began incurring additional environmental compliance expenses beginning in the second quarter of 2015 for reagents associated with compliance with MATS. These expenses are eligible for recovery through Cleco Power\u2019s EAC and subject to periodic review by the LPSC.\nOn February 3, 2016, the LPSC initiated an audit of Cleco Power\u2019s environmental costs for the period November 2010 through December 2015. The total amount of environmental costs included in this audit is $81.2 million. Management is unable to predict or give a reasonable estimate of the possible range of the disallowance, if any, related to this audit. If a\ndisallowance of environmental costs is ordered resulting in a refund, any such refund could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nTransmission Constraints\nTransmission constraints could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nEnergy prices in the MISO market are based on LMP, which includes a component directly related to power flow congestion on the transmission system. Pricing zones with congested power delivery will typically incur a higher LMP. Physical transmission constraints present in the MISO market could increase energy costs within Cleco Power\u2019s pricing zones. Cleco Power purchases FTRs to mitigate the transmission congestion price risks. However, insufficient FTR allocations or increased FTR costs due to negative congestion flows may result in an unexpected increase in energy costs to Cleco Power\u2019s customers. If a disallowance of additional fuel costs associated with congestion is ordered resulting in a refund, any such refund could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nHedging and Risk Management Activities\nCleco Power is subject to market risk associated with fuel cost hedges relating to FTRs and any future open natural gas contracts. Cleco has risk management policies that cannot eliminate all risk involved in its energy commodity activities.\nAnnually, Cleco Power receives Auction Revenue Rights, which can be converted to FTRs. FTRs provide a financial hedge to manage the risk of congestion cost in the Day-Ahead Energy Market. FTRs represent rights to congestion credits or charges along a path during a given time frame for a certain MW quantity. Cleco may purchase additional FTRs to further hedge its congestion cost risk.\nCleco Power may enter into fuel cost hedge positions to mitigate the volatility in fuel costs passed through to its retail customers. When these positions close, actual gains or losses are deferred and included in the FAC in the month the physical contract settles. Recovery of any of these FAC costs is subject to, and may be disallowed as part of, a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit conducted by the LPSC. In June 2015, the LPSC approved a long-term natural gas hedging pilot program that requires Cleco Power to establish a proposal for a long-term natural gas procurement program that will be designed to provide gas price stability for a minimum of five years.\nCleco Power manages its exposure to energy commodity activities by maintaining risk management policies and establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures. However, these risk limits and risk management procedures cannot eliminate all risk associated with these activities.\nFinancial derivatives reforms could increase the liquidity needs and costs of Cleco Power\u2019s commercial trading operations.\nIn July 2010, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) to reform financial markets. This legislation significantly altered the regulation of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, including commodity swaps that could be used by Cleco\nCLECO CORPORATION\nCLECO POWER\n2015 FORM 10-K\nPower to hedge and mitigate commodities risk. The Dodd-Frank Act increases regulatory oversight of OTC energy derivatives, including (1) requiring standardized OTC derivatives to be traded on registered exchanges regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), (2) imposing new and potentially higher capital and margin requirements, and (3) authorizing the establishment of overall volume and position limits. These requirements could cause Cleco Power\u2019s future OTC transactions to be more costly and have an adverse effect on its liquidity due to additional capital requirements. In addition, by standardizing OTC products, these reforms could limit the effectiveness of Cleco Power\u2019s hedging programs because Cleco Power would have less ability to tailor OTC derivatives to match the precise risk it is seeking to protect. The law gives the CFTC authority to exempt end users of energy commodities. The end user exemption reduces but does not eliminate the applicability of these measures. Cleco Power would qualify for the end user exemption which reduces but does not eliminate the applicability of these measures. Management continues to review the final rules that have been issued or will be issued under the Dodd-Frank Act and will continue to monitor this law and its possible impacts on the Registrants.\nCommodity Prices\nCleco Power is subject to the fluctuation in the market prices of fuel or reagent commodities which may increase the cost of producing power.\nCleco Power purchases natural gas, petroleum coke, lignite, coal, and limestone under long-term contracts and on the spot market. Historically, the markets for natural gas and petroleum coke have been volatile and are likely to remain volatile in the future. Cleco Power\u2019s retail and wholesale rates include an FAC that enables it to adjust rates for monthly fluctuations in the cost of fuel and purchased power. However, recovery of any of these LPSC FAC costs is subject to, and may be disallowed as part of, a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit conducted by the LPSC.\nGlobal Economic Environment and Uncertainty; Access to Capital\nAdverse capital market performance could result in reductions in the fair value of benefit plan assets and increase the Registrant\u2019s liabilities related to such plans. Sustained declines in the fair value of the plan\u2019s assets could result in significant increases in funding requirements, which could adversely affect the Registrant\u2019s liquidity and results of operations.\nPerformance of the capital markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under Cleco\u2019s defined benefit pension plan. Sustained adverse market performance could result in lower rates of return for these assets than projected by Cleco and could increase Cleco\u2019s funding requirements related to the pension plan. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the present value of Cleco\u2019s liabilities under the pension plan. As interest rates decrease, Cleco\u2019s liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Adverse changes in assumptions or adverse actual events could cause additional minimum contributions.\nInflation\nAnnual inflation rates, as measured by the U.S. Consumer Price Index, have averaged 1.07% during the three years ended December 31, 2015. Cleco believes inflation at this\nlevel does not materially affect its results of operations or financial condition. However, under established regulatory practice, historical costs have traditionally formed the basis for recovery from customers. As a result, Cleco Power\u2019s cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical plant costs may not be adequate to replace property, plant, and equipment in future years.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect the Registrants\u2019 cost of capital and ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital to operate and grow the business.\nThe Registrants\u2019 business is capital intensive and dependent upon their respective ability to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. The Registrants\u2019 liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster or when there are spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities. The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel, purchased power, or storm restoration costs, higher than expected required pension contributions, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected, or other unexpected events, could cause the financing needs of the Registrants to increase.\nThe Merger Agreement restricts Cleco and its subsidiaries from incurring certain forms of indebtedness without Cleco Partners\u2019 consent. In addition, events beyond the Registrants\u2019 control, such as volatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets, may create uncertainty that could increase their cost of capital or impair their ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on their respective bank credit facilities. The Registrants are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their respective credit facilities as they come up for renewal. Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. If the Registrants are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities, and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants\u2019 ability to fund capital expenditures or to service debt, or on the Registrants\u2019 flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.\nFuture Electricity Sales\nCleco Power\u2019s future electricity sales and corresponding base revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by general economic conditions.\nGeneral economic conditions can negatively impact the businesses of Cleco Power\u2019s residential, industrial, and commercial customers resulting in decreased power consumption, which causes a corresponding decrease in base revenue. Reduced production or the shutdown of any of these customers\u2019 facilities could substantially reduce Cleco Power\u2019s base revenue.\nEnergy conservation, energy efficiency efforts, and other factors that reduce energy demand could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nRegulatory and legislative bodies have proposed or introduced requirements and incentives to reduce peak energy\nCLECO CORPORATION\nCLECO POWER\n2015 FORM 10-K\nconsumption. Conservation and energy efficiency programs are designed to reduce energy demand. Future electricity sales could be impacted by customers switching to alternative sources of energy, such as solar and wind, on-site power generation, and retail customers purchasing less electricity due to increased conservation efforts or expanded energy efficiency measures. Declining usage could result in an under-recovery of fixed costs at Cleco Power\u2019s rate regulated business. Macroeconomic factors resulting in low economic growth or contraction within Cleco\u2019s service territories could also reduce energy demand. An increase in energy conservation, energy efficiency efforts, and other efforts that reduce energy demand could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCleco Power\u2019s Generation, Transmission, and Distribution Facilities\nCleco Power\u2019s generation facilities are susceptible to unplanned outages, significant maintenance requirements, and interruption of fuel deliveries.\nThe operation of power generation facilities involves many risks, including breakdown or failure of equipment, fuel supply interruption, and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. Approximately 25% of Cleco Power\u2019s net capacity was constructed before 1980. Aging equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant expenditures to operate at peak efficiency, or to comply with environmental permits. Newer equipment can also be subject to unexpected failures. Accordingly, in the event of such failures, Cleco Power may incur more frequent unplanned outages, higher than anticipated operating and maintenance expenditures, higher replacement costs of purchased power, increased fuel costs, MISO related costs, and the loss of potential revenue related to competitive opportunities. The costs of such repairs, maintenance, and purchased power may not be fully recoverable and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCleco Power\u2019s generating facilities are fueled primarily by coal, natural gas, petroleum coke, and lignite. The deliverability of these fuel sources may be constrained due to such factors as higher demand, decreased regional supply, production shortages, weather-related disturbances, railroad constraints, waterway levels, labor strikes, or lack of transportation capacity. If the suppliers are unable to deliver the contracted volume of fuel and associated inventories are depleted, Cleco Power may be unable to operate generating units which may cause Cleco Power to operate at higher overall energy costs, which would increase the cost to customers. Fuel and MISO procured/settled energy expenses, which are recovered from customers through the FAC, are subject to refund until either a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit is conducted by the LPSC.\nCompetition for access to other natural resources, particularly oil and natural gas, could negatively impact Cleco Power\u2019s ability to access its lignite reserves. Placement of drilling rigs and pipelines for developing oil and gas reserves can preclude access to lignite in the same areas making the right of first access critical with respect to extracting lignite. Additionally, Cleco Power could be indirectly liable for the impacts of other companies\u2019 activities on lands that have been mined and reclaimed by Cleco Power. Access to lignite\nreserves or the liability for impacts on reclaimed lands may not be recoverable and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nThe construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation and transmission and distribution facilities involve substantial risks. Should construction or capital improvement efforts be significantly more expensive than planned, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of Cleco Power could be materially affected.\nCleco Power\u2019s ability to complete construction of capital improvements to power generation and transmission and distribution facilities in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, engineering and project execution risk and escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance. Delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors not performing as set forth under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel or material costs, changes in the economy, changes in laws or regulations, including environmental compliance requirements, and other events beyond the control of Cleco Power may materially affect the schedule and cost of these projects. If these projects are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Cleco Power could incur additional costs including termination payments, face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project, or may not be able to recover such costs. Furthermore, failure to maintain various levels of generating unit availability or transmission and distribution reliability may result in various disallowances of Cleco Power\u2019s investments.\nMISO\nMISO market operations could have a material adverse effect on\nthe results of operations, generation revenues, energy supply costs, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCleco Power is a member of the MISO market region referred to as \u201cMISO South,\u201d which encompasses parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Dispatch of generation resources and generation volumes to the market is determined by MISO. Costs in the MISO South region are heavily influenced by commodity fuel prices, transmission congestion, dispatch of the generating assets owned not only by Cleco Power, but by all market participants in the MISO South region, and the overall demand and generation availability in the region.\nMISO evaluates forced outage rates to assess generating unit capacity for planning reserve margins. If Cleco Power is subject to an inordinate amount of forced outages, Cleco Power may not possess sufficient planning reserves to serve its needs and could be forced to purchase capacity from the MISO resource adequacy auction. The costs of such capacity may not be recoverable and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. Using MISO\u2019s unforced capacity method for determining generating unit capacity, Cleco Power\u2019s fleet provided for 536MW of capacity in excess of its peak, coincident to MISO\u2019s peak, in 2015.\nCLECO CORPORATION\nCLECO POWER\n2015 FORM 10-K\nReliability and Infrastructure Protection Standards Compliance\nCleco is subject to mandatory reliability and critical infrastructure protection standards. Fines and civil penalties are imposed on those who fail to comply with these standards.\nNERC serves as the ERO with authority to establish and enforce mandatory reliability and infrastructure protection standards, subject to FERC approval, for users of the nation\u2019s transmission system. FERC enforces compliance with these standards. New standards are being developed and existing standards are continuously being modified.\nAs these standards continue to be adopted and modified, they may impose additional compliance requirements on Cleco Power, which may result in an increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses. Failure to comply with these standards can result in the imposition of material fines and civil penalties.\nThe SPP RE conducts a NERC Reliability Standards audit every three years. Cleco\u2019s next audit is scheduled to begin in April 2016. Management is unable to predict the outcome of this audit, or any future audits, or whether any findings will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nEnvironmental Compliance\nCleco\u2019s costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations are significant. The costs of compliance with new environmental laws and regulations, as well as the incurrence of incremental environmental liabilities, could be significant to the Registrants.\nCleco is subject to extensive environmental oversight by federal, state, and local authorities and is required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations related to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety. Cleco also is required to obtain and comply with numerous governmental permits in operating its facilities. Existing environmental laws, regulations, and permits could be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to Cleco. For example, the EPA has issued the CPP to reduce CO2 emissions from existing EGUs by 32% from 2005 levels of CO2 emissions. These changes in environmental regulations governing power plant emissions will be effective beginning 2022, with final emission goals required by 2030, and could render some of Cleco\u2019s EGUs uneconomical to maintain or operate and could prompt early retirement of certain generation units. Any legal obligation that would require Cleco to substantially reduce its emissions beyond present levels could require extensive mitigation efforts and could raise uncertainty about the future viability of some fossil fuels as fuel for new and existing electric generating facilities. Cleco will evaluate potential solutions to comply with such regulations and monitor rulemaking and any legal matters impacting the proposed regulations. Cleco may incur significant capital expenditures or additional operating costs to comply with these revisions, reinterpretations, and new requirements. If Cleco fails to comply, it could be subject to civil or criminal liabilities and fines or may be forced to shut down or reduce production from its facilities. Cleco cannot predict the timing or the outcome of pending or future legislative and rulemaking proposals.\nCleco Power may request from its customers recovery of its costs to comply with new environmental laws and\nregulations. If the LPSC were to deny Cleco Power\u2019s request to recover all or part of its environmental compliance costs, there could be a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nRegulatory Compliance\nCleco operates in a highly regulated environment and adverse regulatory decisions or changes in applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants\u2019 business or result in significant additional costs.\nCleco\u2019s business is subject to extensive federal, state, and local energy, environmental, and other laws and regulations. The LPSC regulates Cleco\u2019s retail operations and FERC regulates Cleco\u2019s wholesale operations. The construction, planning, and siting of Cleco\u2019s power plants and transmission lines also are subject to the jurisdiction of the LPSC and FERC. Additional regulatory authorities have jurisdiction over some of Cleco\u2019s operations and construction projects including the EPA, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, the DOE, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Communications Commission, the LDEQ, the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, the Louisiana Department of Public Safety, regional water quality boards, and various local regulatory districts.\nCleco must periodically apply for licenses and permits from these various regulatory authorities and abide by their respective orders. Should Cleco be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits or should these regulatory authorities initiate any investigations or enforcement actions or impose penalties or disallowances on Cleco, Cleco\u2019s business could be adversely affected. Existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to Cleco or Cleco\u2019s facilities in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on the Registrants\u2019 business or result in significant additional costs due to Cleco\u2019s need to comply with those requirements.\nCleco Power\u2019s Rates\nThe LPSC and FERC regulate the retail rates and transmission tariffs, respectively, that Cleco Power can charge its customers.\nCleco Power\u2019s ongoing financial viability depends on its ability to recover its costs in a timely manner from its LPSC-jurisdictional customers through LPSC-approved rates and its ability to recover its FERC-authorized revenue requirements from its FERC-jurisdictional transmission customers. Cleco Power\u2019s financial viability also depends on its ability to recover in rates an adequate return on capital, including long-term debt and equity. If Cleco Power is unable to recover any material amount of its costs in rates in a timely manner or recover an adequate return on capital, the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants could be materially adversely affected.\nCleco Power\u2019s revenues and earnings are substantially affected by regulatory proceedings known as rate cases or, in some cases, a request for extension of an FRP. During those cases, the LPSC determines Cleco Power\u2019s rate base, depreciation rates, operation and maintenance costs, and administrative and general costs that Cleco Power may recover from its retail customers through its rates. In some\nCLECO CORPORATION\nCLECO POWER\n2015 FORM 10-K\ninstances, the outcome of a rate case or request for extension of an FRP may impact wholesale decisions of Cleco Power. These proceedings may examine, among other things, the prudence of Cleco Power\u2019s operation and maintenance practices, level of subject expenditures, allowed rates of return, and previously incurred capital expenditures. The LPSC has the authority to disallow costs found not to have been prudently incurred. Rate cases generally have timelines of approximately one year, and decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty. The transmission tariffs of Cleco Power are regulated by FERC with its own regulatory proceedings. Both the LPSC and FERC regulatory proceedings can involve multiple parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups, and various consumers of energy, all of whom have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or reducing rates.\nTransmission rates that MISO transmission owners may collect are regulated by FERC. If there is a reduction to the ROE component of the transmission rates, there could be a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nRetail Electric Service\nCleco Power\u2019s retail electric rates and business practices are regulated by the LPSC and reviews may result in refunds to customers.\nCleco Power\u2019s retail rates for residential, commercial, and industrial customers and other retail sales are regulated by the LPSC, which conducts an annual review of Cleco Power\u2019s earnings and regulatory ROE. Cleco Power could be required to make a substantial refund of previously recorded revenue as a result of the LPSC review and such refund could result in a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nWholesale Electric Service\nCleco Power\u2019s business practices are regulated by FERC, and its wholesale rates are subject to FERC\u2019s triennial market power analysis. Cleco could lose the right to sell at market-based rates.\nFERC conducts a review of Cleco Power\u2019s generation market power every three years in addition to each time generation capacity changes. Cleco filed its most recent triennial market power analysis with FERC on January 23, 2015. If FERC determines Cleco Power possesses generation market power in excess of certain thresholds, Cleco Power could lose the right to sell wholesale generation at market-based rates, which could result in a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nWeather Sensitivity\nThe operating results of Cleco Power are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal basis.\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity, particularly kWh sales to residential customers. In Cleco Power\u2019s service territory, demand for power typically peaks during the hot summer months. As a result, Cleco Power\u2019s financial results may fluctuate on a seasonal basis. In addition, Cleco Power has sold less power and, consequently, earned less income when weather conditions were milder.\nUnusually mild weather in the future could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nSevere weather, including hurricanes and winter storms, can affect transportation of fuel to plant sites and can be destructive, causing outages and property damage that can potentially result in additional expenses, lower revenue, and additional capital restoration costs. Extreme drought conditions can impact the availability of cooling water to support the operations of generating plants, which can also result in additional expenses and lower revenue.\nThe physical risks associated with global climate change could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nThe Registrants recognize that certain groups associate severe weather with global climate change and forecast the possibility that these weather events could have a material impact on future results of operations should they occur more frequently and with greater severity. If there is an actual occurrence of such global climate change, it could result in one or more physical risks, such as an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding, and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms, or could affect the Registrants\u2019 operations. The Registrants\u2019 assets are in and serve communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. A significant portion of the nation\u2019s oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and is susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland and barrier island erosion, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes.\nThese and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generating facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on Cleco Power\u2019s ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. Also, to the extent that climate change would adversely impact the economic health of a region or result in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. Such physical or operational risks could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nLitigation\nThe outcome of legal proceedings cannot be predicted. An adverse finding could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nThe Registrants are party to various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary operations of their business. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined, nor, in many cases, can the liability that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case presently be reasonably estimated. The liability that the Registrants may ultimately incur with respect to any of these cases in the event of a negative outcome may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and insured against with respect to such matters and, as a result,\nCLECO CORPORATION\nCLECO POWER\n2015 FORM 10-K\nthese matters may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nAlternative Generation Technology\nChanges in technology may have a material adverse effect on the value of Cleco Power\u2019s generating facilities.\nA basic premise of Cleco\u2019s business is that generating electricity at central power plants achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at a relatively low price. There are alternative technologies to produce electricity, most notably fuel cells, wind turbines, photovoltaic cells, and other solar generated power. Many companies and organizations conduct research and development activities to seek improvements in alternative technologies. It is possible that advances will reduce the cost of alternative methods of electricity production to a level that is equal to or below that of most central station production. In addition, as new technologies are developed and become available, the quantity and pattern of electricity purchased by customers could decline, with a corresponding decline in revenues derived by generating assets. Also, the current presidential administration and certain members of the Congress have voiced support for such alternative energy sources. As a result, the value of Cleco Power\u2019s generating facilities could be reduced.\nTaxes\nChanges in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nThe Registrants make judgments regarding the utilization of existing income tax credits and the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. Tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. These judgments include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results, or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by the Registrants could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCleco Credit Ratings\nA downgrade in Cleco Corporation\u2019s or Cleco Power\u2019s credit ratings could result in an increase in their respective borrowing costs and a reduced pool of potential investors and funding sources.\nNeither Cleco Corporation nor Cleco Power can assure that its current debt ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of its debt ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. Upon announcement of the Merger, Moody\u2019s and S&P placed Cleco Corporation and Cleco Power on negative outlook and CreditWatch negative, respectively. On February 25, 2016, S&P changed the outlook for Cleco Corporation and Cleco Power from CreditWatch negative to CreditWatch developing. Prior to close of the Merger or upon termination of the Merger Agreement, it is expected that the credit rating agencies will update their ratings on both Cleco Corporation and Cleco Power taking into consideration the results of the merger transaction. If Moody\u2019s\nor S&P were to downgrade Cleco Corporation\u2019s or Cleco Power\u2019s long-term ratings, particularly below investment grade, the value of their debt securities would likely be adversely affected. In addition, Cleco Corporation or Cleco Power, as the case may be, would likely be required to pay higher interest rates in future debt financings and be subject to more onerous debt covenants, and their pool of potential investors and funding sources could decrease.\nHolding Company\nCleco Corporation is a holding company and its ability to meet its debt obligations and pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent on the cash generated by its subsidiaries.\nCleco Corporation is a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, Cleco Corporation\u2019s ability to meet its debt obligations and to pay dividends to its shareholders is largely dependent upon the cash generated by these subsidiaries. Cleco Corporation\u2019s subsidiaries are separate and distinct entities and have no obligations to pay any amounts due on Cleco Corporation\u2019s debt or to make any funds available for such payment. In addition, Cleco Corporation\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make dividend payments or other distributions to Cleco Corporation may be restricted by their obligations to holders of their outstanding securities and to other general business creditors. Substantially all of Cleco\u2019s consolidated assets are held by Cleco Power. Cleco Corporation\u2019s right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of its creditors to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if Cleco Corporation were a creditor of any subsidiary, its rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by Cleco Corporation. Moreover, Cleco Power, Cleco Corporation\u2019s principal subsidiary, is subject to regulation by the LPSC, which may impose limits on the amount of dividends that Cleco Power may pay Cleco Corporation.\nTechnology and Terrorism Threats\nThe operational and information systems on which Cleco relies to conduct its business and serve customers could fail to function properly due to technological problems, cyber attacks, physical attacks on Cleco\u2019s assets, acts of terrorism, severe weather, solar events, electromagnetic events, natural disasters, the age and condition of information technology assets, human error, or other reasons that could disrupt Cleco\u2019s operations and cause Cleco to incur unanticipated losses and expense.\nThe operation of Cleco\u2019s extensive electrical systems relies on evolving operational and information technology systems and network infrastructures that are becoming extremely complex as new technologies and systems are implemented to more safely and reliably deliver electric services. Cleco\u2019s business is highly dependent on its ability to process and monitor, on a real-time daily basis, a large number of tasks and transactions, many of which are highly complex. The failure of Cleco\u2019s operational and information systems and networks due to a physical or cyber attack, or other event would significantly disrupt operations; cause harm to the public or employees; result in outages or reduced generating output; result in damage to Cleco\u2019s assets or operations, or those of third parties; and subject Cleco to claims by customers or third\nCLECO CORPORATION\nCLECO POWER\n2015 FORM 10-K\nparties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCleco\u2019s systems, including its financial information, operational systems, advanced metering, and billing systems, require constant maintenance, monitoring, security patches, modification or configuration of systems, and update and upgrade of systems, which can be costly and increase the risk of errors and malfunction. Any disruptions or deficiencies in existing systems, or disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the modification or implementation of new systems, could result in increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues, the diversion of management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention and resources, and could adversely affect the effectiveness of Cleco\u2019s control environment, and/or its ability to accurately or timely file required regulatory reports.\nDespite implementation of security and mitigation measures, all of Cleco\u2019s technology systems are vulnerable to inoperability and/or impaired operations or failures due to cyber and/or physical attacks on the facilities and equipment needed to operate the technology systems, viruses, human errors, acts of war or terrorism, and other events. If Cleco\u2019s information technology systems or network infrastructure were to fail, Cleco might be unable to fulfill critical business functions and serve its customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial conditions, results of operations, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of its business, Cleco collects and retains sensitive information including personal identification information about customers and employees, customer energy usage, and other confidential information. The theft, damage, or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data could subject Cleco to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, subject Cleco to claims from third parties, and/or harm Cleco\u2019s reputation.\nInsurance\nCleco\u2019s insurance coverage may not be sufficient.\nCleco currently has property, casualty, and liability insurance policies in place to protect its employees, directors, and assets in amounts that it considers appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of Cleco\u2019s facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nLike other utilities that serve coastal regions, Cleco does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because it believes such insurance to be cost prohibitive. In the future, Cleco may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other natural disasters through issuance of storm recovery bonds or a change in Cleco Power\u2019s regulated rates or otherwise, or any such recovery may not be timely granted. Therefore, Cleco may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCleco Power LLC\u2019s Unsecured and Unsubordinated Obligations\nCleco Power LLC\u2019s unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, including, without limitation, its senior notes, will be effectively subordinated to any secured debt of Cleco Power LLC, certain unsecured debt of Cleco Power LLC, and any preferred equity of any of Cleco Power LLC\u2019s subsidiaries.\nSome of Cleco Power LLC\u2019s senior notes and its obligations under various loan agreements and refunding agreements with the Rapides Finance Authority, the Louisiana Public Facilities Authority, and other issuers of tax-exempt bonds for the benefit of Cleco Power LLC are unsecured and rank equally with all of Cleco Power LLC\u2019s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. As of December 31, 2015, Cleco Power LLC had an aggregate of $1.17 billion of unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Cleco Power LLC will be effectively subordinated to, and thus have a junior position to, any secured debt that Cleco Power LLC may have outstanding from time to time (including any mortgage bonds) with respect to the assets securing such debt. Certain agreements entered into by Cleco Power LLC with other lenders that are unsecured provide that if Cleco Power LLC issues secured debt, Cleco Power is obligated to grant these lenders the same security interest in certain assets of Cleco Power LLC. If such a security interest were to arise, it would further subordinate Cleco Power LLC\u2019s unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Cleco Power LLC had no secured indebtedness outstanding. Cleco Power LLC may issue mortgage bonds in the future under its current or any future Indenture of Mortgage, and holders of mortgage bonds would have a prior claim on certain Cleco Power LLC material assets upon dissolution, winding up, liquidation, or reorganization. Additionally, Cleco Power LLC\u2019s ability (and the ability of Cleco Power LLC\u2019s creditors, including holders of its senior notes) to participate in the assets of Cleco Power LLC\u2019s subsidiary, Cleco Katrina/Rita, is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. As of December 31, 2015, Cleco Katrina/Rita had $84.2 million of indebtedness outstanding, net of debt discount.\nHealth Care Reform\nCleco may experience increased costs arising from health care reform.\nIn 2010, the President of the U.S. signed the PPACA, a comprehensive health care law. This law has had a significant impact on health care providers, insurers, and others associated with the health care industry. Cleco continues to evaluate the impact of this comprehensive law on its business and has made the required changes to its health plan. Federal and state governments may propose other health care initiatives and revisions to the health care and health insurance systems. It is uncertain what legislative programs, if any, will be adopted in the future, or what action Congress or state legislatures may take regarding other health care reform proposals or legislation. The complexities and ramifications of the legislation are significant and are being implemented through a phased-in approach concluding in 2020. Management is unable to estimate the comprehensive effects of health care reform and its impact on the Registrants\u2019 business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. Accordingly, the PPACA could adversely affect the cost of providing health care coverage generally and could have a\nCLECO CORPORATION\nCLECO POWER\n2015 FORM 10-K\nmaterial adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nWorkforce\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCertain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, matching of skill set or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a\nlengthy time period associated with skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the Registrants\u2019 businesses. If the Registrants are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants could be materially adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 64557, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "CNL"}
