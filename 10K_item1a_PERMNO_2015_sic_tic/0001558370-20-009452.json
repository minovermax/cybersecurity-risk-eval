Our future performance is subject to risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock. We may be subject to other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us. In addition, please see our note about forward-looking statements included in Part II, Item 7, MD&A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nOur revenue is subject to volatility in metal prices, which could negatively affect our results of operations or cash flow.\nMarket prices for gold, silver, copper, nickel, and other metals may fluctuate widely over time and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include metal supply and demand, industrial and jewelry fabrication, investment demand, central banking actions, inflation expectations, currency values, interest rates, forward sales by metal producers, and political, trade, economic, or banking conditions.\nOur revenue is directly tied to metal prices. Under our stream agreements, we purchase metal at a fixed price or a stated percentage of the market price and then sell the metal in the open market. If market prices decline, our revenue and cash flow from metal sales decline. A price decline can also impact our revenue under certain sliding-scale royalty agreements as we may receive a lower royalty rate when prices fall below specified thresholds. In addition, some of our royalty agreements are based on the operator\u2019s concentrate sales to smelters and allow for price adjustments between the operator and the smelter based on metals prices on a future date, typically three to five months after shipment of concentrate. These price adjustments can decrease our revenue in future periods if metal prices decline following shipment.\nPrice declines could cause an operator to reduce, suspend, or terminate production or development at a project, which would impact our future revenue from the project. These production or development decisions could prevent us from recovering our initial investment in the project or result in an impairment to the value of our initial investment.\nWe own passive interests in mining properties and cannot ensure properties are developed or operated in our best interests.\nOur revenue is derived entirely from stream and royalty interests in properties owned and operated by third parties. In general, we have no decision-making authority regarding the development or operation of the mineral properties underlying our stream and royalty interests. Operators make all development and operating decisions, including decisions about permitting, feasibility analysis, mine design and operation, processing, plant and equipment matters, and temporary or permanent suspension of operations. We generally are not entitled to compensation if operations are shut down. This creates risk for us because operators may at times have business interests that are inconsistent with our interests or may act contrary to our interests.\nOur revenue is subject to operational and other risks faced by operators of the properties in which we hold stream or royalty interests.\nWe generally are not required to pay capital or operating costs on projects in which we hold stream or royalty interests. However, our revenue and the value of our investments are indirectly subject to hazards and risks normally associated with developing and operating mining properties, including the following:\n\u25cf insufficient ore reserves\n\u25cf increased capital or operating costs\n\u25cf declines in the price of gold, silver, copper, nickel, or other metals\n\u25cf construction or development delays\n\u25cf operational disruptions, including those caused by pandemics or other global or local health crises\n\u25cf inability to obtain or maintain necessary permits\n\u25cf inability to replace or increase reserves as properties are mined\n\u25cf inability to maintain, or challenges to, exploration or mining rights\n\u25cf changes in mining taxes and royalties payable to governments\n\u25cf significant changes to environmental, permitting, or other regulatory requirements\n\u25cf challenges to operations, permits, or mining rights by local communities, indigenous populations, non-government organizations, or others\n\u25cf litigation between operators and third parties relating to the properties\n\u25cf community or civil unrest, including protests and blockades\n\u25cf labor shortages, increased labor costs, labor disputes, strikes, or work stoppages\n\u25cf unavailability of mining, drilling, or other equipment\n\u25cf unanticipated geological conditions or metallurgical characteristics\n\u25cf unanticipated ground or water conditions, including lack of access to sufficient water\n\u25cf inadequate supplies of power or other raw materials\n\u25cf pit wall or tailings dam failures or underground stability issues\n\u25cf fires, explosions, or other industrial accidents\n\u25cf injuries to humans, property, or the environment\n\u25cf natural catastrophes and environmental hazards such as earthquakes, droughts, floods, forest fires, hurricanes, weather, or climate events\n\u25cf physical effects of climate change and regulatory changes designed to reduce the effects of climate change;\n\u25cf uncertain political and economic environments\n\u25cf economic downturns\n\u25cf insufficient financing or inability to obtain financing\n\u25cf default by an operator on its obligations to us or its other creditors\n\u25cf insolvency, bankruptcy, or other financial difficulty of the operator\n\u25cf changes in laws or regulations or the enforcement of laws or regulations\nThe occurrence of any of these events could negatively impact operations at the properties in which we hold stream or royalty interests, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow.\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, operations at some properties in which we have stream or royalty interests, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe world is currently experiencing a deadly outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19. Public health and government authorities have recommended and mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including in some cases quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and restrictions on mining-related activities. As a result, several of our operating counterparties, including at our principal properties, have had temporary operational curtailments. There may be additional curtailments. The COVID-19 pandemic could also disrupt operators\u2019 supply or distribution chains or access to workers, which in turn could adversely impact their production or sales. In addition, development and exploration activities at some properties may be delayed or suspended. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition in future periods. We are unable to predict the nature or extent of any impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our future results of operations and financial condition.\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the global economy and markets over the past several months and may continue to do so, which could adversely affect our business or the trading price of our stock.\nThe global economy, metal prices, and financial markets have experienced significant volatility and uncertainty due to COVID-19. Our revenue is directly related to the market price of gold and other metals. Metal price volatility causes our revenue to fluctuate from period to period. This price volatility could also cause operators or developers to defer or forgo projects, which could adversely impact our future revenue. Moreover, in the ordinary course of business, we review opportunities to acquire new stream and royalty interests and currently have acquisition opportunities at various stages of review. Reduced economic and travel activities or illness among our management team as a result of COVID-19 could limit or delay acquisition opportunities or other business activities. In addition, economic volatility, disruptions in the financial markets, or severe price declines for gold or other metals could adversely affect our ability to obtain future debt or equity financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms. Government efforts to counter the economic effects of COVID-19 through liquidity and stimulus programs may be insufficient or ineffective in preventing or reducing the effects of a recession. It is difficult to determine the extent of the economic and market impacts from COVID-19 and the many ways in which they may negatively affect our business and the trading price of our stock.\nA significant portion of our revenue comes from a small number of operating properties, which means that adverse developments at these properties could have a more significant or lasting impact on our results of operations than if our revenue was less concentrated.\nApproximately 75% of our revenue for fiscal year 2020 came from six properties: Mount Milligan, Andacollo, Pueblo Viejo, Wassa, Pe\u00f1asquito, and Cortez. We expect these properties to continue to represent a significant portion of revenue going forward. This concentration of revenue could mean that adverse developments, including any adverse decisions made by the operators, at one or more of these properties could have a more significant or longer-term impact on our results of operations than if our revenue was less concentrated.\nOperators may fail to comply with their contractual arrangements with us or may interpret their obligations in a manner adverse to us, which could decrease our revenue or increase our costs.\nAt times, operators may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their contractual obligations to us. In addition, we often rely on the operators for the calculation of our stream deliveries or royalty payments. When we enter into new stream or royalty interests, we attempt to secure contractual rights that allow us to monitor operators\u2019 compliance with their obligations to us, such as audit or access rights. However, these rights may not be sufficient to ensure compliance. In addition, our stream and royalty agreements are often complex and may be subject to interpretation or uncertainties. Operators and other counterparties may interpret our interests in a manner adverse to us. For these or other reasons, we could be forced to expend resources or take legal action to enforce our contractual rights. We may not be successful in enforcing our contractual rights. As a result, our revenue relating to the disputed interests could be adversely affected. We may also need to expend significant monetary and human resources to defend our position, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we may be required to make retroactive revenue adjustments in future periods relating to past period revenue as a result of information that we learn through audit or access rights.\nWe often have limited access to data about operating properties, which may make it difficult for us to project or assess the performance of our stream and royalty interests.\nWe often do not have the contractual right to receive production, operating, and other data from the operators of the properties in which we hold stream and royalty interests. As a result, it may be difficult for us to project or assess the performance of a stream or royalty interest. This could result in delays in, or reductions of, our cash flow from the amounts that we anticipate based on the stage of development of or production from the properties, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur stream and royalty interests may not result in the anticipated returns or may not otherwise ultimately benefit our business.\nWe are continually reviewing opportunities to acquire new stream and royalty interests, and we have acquisition opportunities at various stages of review. Any acquisition could be material to us. At times, we also consider opportunities to restructure our existing stream or royalty interests where we believe the restructuring would provide a long-term benefit to us, even though it could reduce near-term revenues or result in the incurrence of transaction-related costs. The success\nof our stream and royalty interests is based in part on our ability to make accurate assumptions at the time of acquisition about the amount and timing of revenue to be derived from those interests. These assumptions are based on a variety of factors, including the geological, metallurgical, permitting, environmental, and other aspects of the project. For development projects, we also make assumptions about the cost, timing, and conduct of development. If an operator fails to bring a project into production as expected or if actual performance otherwise falls short of our assumptions, our revenue derived from the project may not be sufficient to yield an adequate, or any, return on our investment. In addition, we could be required to decrease the carrying value of our investment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We cannot ensure that any acquisition or other transaction will ultimately benefit Royal Gold.\nWe may not be able to acquire additional stream or royalty interests at appropriate valuations.\nOur future success depends largely on our ability to acquire additional stream and royalty interests at appropriate valuations. We may not be able to identify and complete acquisitions of additional interests at appropriate prices or terms. We may not have sufficient liquidity or may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing to fund acquisitions due to economic volatility, credit crises, declines in metal prices, or other reasons. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do, and we may not be able to compete effectively against them. In addition, changes to tax rules, accounting policies, or the treatment of stream interests by ratings agencies could make streams or royalties less attractive to counterparties. Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to acquire new stream or royalty interests, which would adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of the agreements governing our stream and royalty interests contain terms that reduce or cap the revenue generated from those interests.\nRevenue from some of our stream and royalty interests decreases or stops after threshold production, delivery, or payment milestones are achieved. For example, our stream interests at Pueblo Viejo, Andacollo, Wassa, and Khoemacau, and certain of our royalty interests at other properties, contain these types of limitations. As a result, past production and revenue relating to these interests may not be indicative of future results.\nIf the assumptions underlying operators\u2019 production, reserve, or mineralized material estimates are inaccurate or if future events cause operators to negatively adjust their previous estimates, our future revenue or the value of our investments could be adversely affected.\nThe operators of the properties in which we hold stream and royalty interests generally prepare production and reserve estimates for the properties. We do not independently prepare or verify this information. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in these estimates, many of which are outside the operators\u2019 control. As a result, production and reserve estimates are subjective and necessarily depend upon a number of assumptions, including, among others, reliability of historical data, geologic and mining conditions, metallurgical recovery, metal prices, operating costs, capital expenditures, development and reclamation costs, mining technology improvements, and the effects of government regulation. If any of the assumptions that operators make in connection with production or reserve estimates are incorrect, actual production could be significantly lower than the production or reserve estimates, which could adversely affect our future revenue and the value of our investments. In addition, if operators\u2019 estimates with respect to the timing of production are incorrect, we may experience variances in expected revenue from period to period.\nSome operators also report publicly or to us estimates of mineralized material. The term \u201cmineralized material\u201d does not indicate proven or probable reserves as defined by the SEC. Mineralized material is subject to future exploration and development and associated risks and may never convert to future reserves. In addition, estimates of mineralized material are subject to similar uncertainties and assumptions as discussed above with respect to mineral reserves.\nOur disclosures relating to operating properties will change as a result of new SEC disclosure rules, and we continue to face uncertainty around how some of these rules apply to a streaming and royalty company.\nIn 2018, the SEC adopted amendments to its disclosure requirements for mining companies, including streaming and royalty companies. We are required to comply with the new rules for our fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2021. Our disclosures about operating properties will change under the new rules, and, in some cases, we may be required to disclose in our SEC filings more or less information than we currently disclose about these properties. There continues to be uncertainty about how the rules will apply to a streaming and royalty company with significant investments in properties run by international operators that are not required to report under SEC rules.\nMost of our revenue is derived from properties outside the United States, and risks associated with conducting business in foreign countries or other sovereign jurisdictions could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOver 90% of our revenue comes from properties outside of the United States, and many of our operators are organized outside of the United States. Within the United States and other countries, indigenous people may be recognized as sovereign entities and may enforce their own laws and regulations. Our and operators\u2019 activities are subject to the risks associated with conducting business in foreign countries or other sovereign jurisdictions, including the following:\n\u25cf expropriation or nationalization of mining property or other government takings\n\u25cf seizure of mineral production\n\u25cf exchange and currency controls and fluctuations\n\u25cf limitations on foreign exchange or repatriation of earnings\n\u25cf restrictions on mineral production or price controls\n\u25cf import or export regulations, including trade wars and sanctions and restrictions on metal exports\n\u25cf changes in government taxation, royalties, tariffs, or duties\n\u25cf changes in economic, trade, diplomatic, or other relationships between countries or the effects on global and economic conditions, the stability of global financial markets, or the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets\n\u25cf high rates of inflation\n\u25cf unfamiliar or uncertain foreign real estate, mineral tenure, safety, or environmental rules\n\u25cf war, crime, terrorism, sabotage, blockades, or other forms of civil unrest\n\u25cf uncertain political or economic environments\n\u25cf corruption\n\u25cf exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption or anti-money laundering laws\n\u25cf suspension of the enforcement of creditors\u2019 or stockholders\u2019 rights\n\u25cf loss of access to government-controlled infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, rails, ports, power sources, and water supplies\nThese risks may limit or disrupt the development or operation of properties in which we hold stream and royalty interests or impair our rights or interests in these properties, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe and our operating properties may be subject to environmental risks, including risks associated with climate change, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or the value of our investments.\nMining operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing land use and the protection of the environment. In addition, many countries have implemented laws and regulations designed to address the effects of climate change, including rules to reduce industrial emissions and increase energy efficiency. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving in a manner generally expected to result in stricter standards, more liability, and increased costs. Compliance with these laws and regulations can impose substantial costs and burdens on operators of properties subject to our interests. In addition, an operator\u2019s failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in injunctive action, orders to\nsuspend or cease operations, damages, or civil or criminal penalties on the operator. If any of these events were to occur, our revenue or the value of our investment could be adversely affected.\nFurther, due to expansive environmental laws, it is possible that we could become subject to environmental liabilities for historic periods during which we owned or operated properties or relative to our current ownership interests in lease and underlying unpatented mining claims. These liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nUnknown defects in our stream or royalty interests or the bankruptcy or insolvency of an operator could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments.\nDespite our due diligence practices, it is possible that unknown defects or problems will exist relating to the existence, validity, enforceability, terms, or geographic extent of our stream and royalty interests. Similarly, stream interests and, in many jurisdictions, royalty interests are contractual in nature, rather than interests in land. As a result, these interests may not survive a bankruptcy or insolvency of an operator. We often do not have the protection of security interests that could help us recover all or part of our investment in a stream or royalty interest in the event of an operator\u2019s bankruptcy or insolvency. If our stream or royalty interests were set aside through judicial or administrative proceedings, the value of our investments could be adversely affected.\nAnti-corruption laws and regulations could subject us to liability and require us to incur costs.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to third parties, including foreign governments and their officials, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In some cases, we invest in mining operations in jurisdictions that have experienced corruption in the past. Our international investment activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments in violation of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by one of our employees or agents in violation of our policies. In addition, the operators of the properties in which we own stream and royalty interests may fail to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations. Although we are passive investors in these properties, enforcement authorities could deem us to have some culpability for the operators\u2019 actions. Any violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws could result in significant civil or criminal penalties to us and could have an adverse effect on our reputation.\nA significant disruption to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely on a variety of information technology and automated operating systems to manage and support our operations. For example, we depend on our information technology systems for financial reporting, operational and investment management, and email. These systems contain our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our employees. The proper functioning of these systems and the security of this data is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business. In addition, these systems could require modifications or upgrades as a result of technological changes or growth in our business. These changes could be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. Our systems, and those of third-party providers, could be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, viruses or malware, physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized access, or cyber-attacks. Any security breach could compromise our networks, and the information stored on them could be improperly accessed, disclosed, lost, or stolen. The steps that we have taken to secure our systems and electronic information may not be adequate to prevent a disruption. Any unauthorized activities could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, or result in legal claims or proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or operating results.\nWe depend on the services of our executives and other key employees, and the loss of one or more members of our management team could harm our business.\nWe believe that our success depends on retaining qualified executives and other key employees. Our management team has significant industry and company-specific experience. If we are unsuccessful at retaining or attracting qualified personnel, our business could be disrupted and our ability to achieve our business objectives and grow effectively could be jeopardized. We do not currently maintain key person life insurance on any of our directors or employees.\nCurrent and future indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business.\nAs of June 30, 2020, we had $305 million outstanding and $695 million available under our revolving credit facility. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Current and future indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund acquisitions, working capital, or dividends\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business\n\u25cf restrict us from exploiting business opportunities\n\u25cf make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness\n\u25cf require the consent of our existing lenders to incur additional indebtedness\n\u25cf limit our ability to borrow additional funds for acquisitions, working capital, or debt-service requirements\nOur credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants. For example, the agreement includes financial covenants that require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio (as these terms are defined under the agreement). These covenants could limit our ability to engage in activities that are in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with these covenants would result in an event of default that, if not waived, could result in the acceleration of all outstanding indebtedness. Our credit facility expires in June 2024. In the future, we may be unable to obtain new financing or refinancing on acceptable terms.\nThe proposed phase out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of calendar 2021. The Federal Reserve Board has convened a group of private-market participants to identify a proposed alternative rate and address the transition from LIBOR to an alternative rate. In 2019, the FASB proposed guidance that would help facilitate the market transition from existing reference rates to alternative rates. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin. Under the agreement governing the facility, if LIBOR is phased out, we are required to negotiate in good faith to establish an alternative rate under the facility. There is currently no definitive information regarding the future use of LIBOR or a replacement rate. We are unable to predict whether and to what extent a LIBOR change would impact our future results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur stock price may continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so in the future. For example, during fiscal year 2020, the market price of our common stock ranged from a low of $59.78 to a high of $139.63. Many\nfactors unrelated to operating performance can contribute to volatility in the market price of our common stock, including the following:\n\u25cf economic, market, or political conditions, including the effects of COVID-19\n\u25cf market prices of gold, silver, copper, nickel, and other metals\n\u25cf developments relating to operating properties\n\u25cf interest rates and expectations about inflation\n\u25cf currency values\n\u25cf credit market conditions\nThese market fluctuations, regardless of cause, may materially and adversely affect our stock price. As a result, you could lose all or part of your investment.\nWe may issue additional equity securities, which would dilute our existing stockholders and reduce our per-share financial measures and could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe may issue additional equity in the future in connection with acquisitions, strategic transactions, or for other purposes. If we issue additional equity securities, our existing stockholders would be diluted and our per-share financial measures would be reduced. In addition, shares of common stock that we issue in connection with an acquisition may not be subject to resale restrictions. The market price of our common stock could decline if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock or are perceived by the market as intending to sell these shares other than in an orderly manner.\nWe may change our practice of paying dividends, which could reduce the value of your investment.\nWe have paid a cash dividend on our common stock since calendar year 2000. Our board of directors has discretion in determining whether to declare a dividend based on a number of factors, including metal prices, economic or market conditions, earnings, cash flow, financial condition, and funding requirements for future opportunities or operations. In addition, corporate law limitations or future contractual restrictions could limit our ability to pay dividends in the future. If our board of directors reduces or eliminates future dividends, our stock price could fall, and the success of your investment would depend largely on any future stock price appreciation. We have increased our dividend in prior years. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to do so or that we will pay any dividends.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our organizational documents could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us.\nThe anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose barriers to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock. Among other things, these provisions provide for the following:\n\u25cf allow our board of directors to issue shares of common stock and preferred stock without stockholder approval, except as may be required by Nasdaq rules\n\u25cf allow our board of directors to establish the rights and preferences of authorized and unissued preferred stock\n\u25cf provide for a classified board, whereby our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms\n\u25cf prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders\n\u25cf require advance notice of stockholder proposals and related information\n\u25cf require vacancies and newly created directorships on the board of directors to be filled only by affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then serving on the board\nThese provisions could increase the cost of acquiring us or discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, which could decrease the value of your investment.", "PERMNO": 67847, "SIC": 6795, "TIC": "RGLD"}
