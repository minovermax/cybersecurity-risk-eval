Risk Factors\nAn investment in shares of our securities is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. We face a variety of risks that may affect our operations or financial results and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. Before investing in our securities, you should carefully consider the following risks, together with the financial and other information contained in this Report. Our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result of any of these risks. In that case, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline and you may lose all or a part of your investment. Only those investors who can bear the risk of loss of their entire investment should invest in our securities.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and the Industry in Which We Operate.\nOur business is dependent on a single exploration asset; if the proposed appraisal program is not approved, we will not have any exploration assets.\nThe Concession is our single exploration asset. We have been conducting exploration work related to offshore Guinea since 2002, including significant seismic data surveys, processing, evaluations and studies, but we have no reserves and there is no assurance that our exploration work will result in any discoveries or in any commercial success.\nAfter the completion of the Fatala-1 well, we applied for a two-year appraisal period on the basis of the marginal discovery of five meters of calculated hydrocarbon pay in the well. Our 50% partner, SAPETRO, decided not to join us in the application and exited the JOA and PSC, so it was made on a 100% basis. There is no assurance that the Government of Guinea will approve the application at all or on acceptable terms. If the Government of Guinea does not approve the appraisal period on acceptable terms, our PSC will have expired by its terms and we will not have any exploration assets nor any prospect of revenues or cash flows to cover current obligations or ongoing operating expenses.\nThe Concession, permits and contracts which rely on the Concession may be changed, thus adversely affecting our ability to continue the operations. In addition, the PSC has financial and other administrative obligations that need to be performed in order to maintain compliance with the PSC. Failure to comply could subject us to risk of losing the Concession. In addition, oil and natural gas operations in Africa may be subject to higher political, health and security risks than operations in other areas of the world. Any adverse development affecting our operations such as, but not limited to, the drilling and operational hazards described below, could result in damage to, or destruction of, any wells and producing facilities constructed on the Concession as well as damage to life. As the Concession is our only exploration asset, any adverse development affecting it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe have entered into an agreement to raise $6,000,000 through the sale of 40,000,000 shares of our common stock, but there can be no assurance that this financing will be completed.\nOn November 2, 2017, we executed an agreement to issue and sell 40 million shares of our common stock at a price of $0.15 per share (for a total purchase price of $6,000,000) to CLNG or its affiliate. The closing of the sale is subject to substantial conditions, including (i) the completion of satisfactory due diligence by each party of the other, (ii) waiver by holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of their right of first refusal, (iii) negotiation of reductions in our outstanding current liabilities satisfactory to CLNG, and (iv) satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. If this purchase is completed, CLNG will own approximately 53% of our outstanding common stock. There can be no assurance that our due diligence of CLNG will be acceptable to us, that CLNG\u2019s due diligence of us will be acceptable to CLNG, that all holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will waive their right of first refusal, that we will successfully negotiate reductions in our outstanding current liabilities satisfactory to CLNG, or, even if these conditions are satisfied, that the stock purchase agreement will close.\nThe net proceeds of this stock sale, if it occurs, may not be sufficient to pay all of our outstanding liabilities and will not be sufficient to cover current operating expenses or, if the two-year appraisal period in Guinea for which we have applied is granted, to be able to fund operations for the appraisal program. See the following Risk Factor for additional information.\nWe require additional financing to meet our general and administrative obligations and in order to fulfill our PSC commitments during an appraisal program. We are currently not in a position to predict when, if ever, we will be able to meet those obligations.\nThe Concession offshore Guinea is our principal asset and we do not have the funds necessary to fulfill the proposed appraisal program under the PSC. On November 14, 2017, we had $0.7 million in unrestricted cash and $9.9 million in current liabilities. In the absence of operating cash flows, in order to meet our current obligations as they become due over the next quarter and 12 months and, if the two-year appraisal period for which we have applied is granted, to be able to continue with our operations, we intend to rely exclusively on issuing equity or debt securities or, alternatively,\ndivestiture of additional participating interests in the Concession. There is no assurance that we will be successful in raising the funds or acquiring the partners in the time needed to execute the program required in the PSC. If the two-year appraisal period is not granted by the Guinea government, the PSC will have expired by its terms and it is unlikely that we will be able to raise additional funds, unless the investment by CLNG closes.\nThe absence of cash inflows into our company raises substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern as reflected in the opinion of the auditors of our financial statements. If we are not successful in carrying out our fund-raising plans, we will not be able to continue operations.\nOur financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. As noted in Note 1 to our financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, the absence of cash inflows raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our auditors have noted this concern in their opinion on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our plans to address this problem are discussed in Note 1. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in carrying out our plans to obtain additional cash resources. If we are unable to obtain additional cash resources, we will not be able to continue operations.\nWe have no proved reserves and our exploration program may not yield oil in commercial quantities or quality, or at all.\nWe have no proved reserves. To date, we have drilled two exploratory wells which had non-commercial results. We have identified prospects and leads based on seismic and geological information that we believe indicate the potential presence of hydrocarbons. However, we operate in a virgin basin without any commercial hydrocarbon discoveries and the areas to be drilled may not yield oil in commercial quantities or quality, or at all. Even when properly used and interpreted, 2-dimensional (\"2D\") and 3-dimensional (\"3D\") seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. Accordingly, we do not know if any of our prospects will contain oil in sufficient quantities or quality, or at all, to allow us to recover drilling and completion costs or to be economically viable. Even if oil is found in commercial quantities, construction costs of oil pipelines or floating production systems, as applicable, and transportation costs may prevent such leads from being economically viable. If these exploration efforts do not prove to be successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nEfforts to attract commercial partners may not be successful and may not be on terms advantageous to us.\nWe have no source of operating revenue and will need to obtain additional resources through sales of additional participating interests in the Concession, equity or debt financings, or through other means. If we seek to sell additional participating interests in the Concession, we may not be successful in attracting commercial partners. In addition, if we enter into an arrangement, the terms of such arrangement may not be advantageous to us. Any such arrangement will likely involve a further transfer of a participating interest in the Concession, which could reduce the potential profitability of our interest in the Concession.\nAn extended period of depressed oil and gas prices could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and future operating results. Oil and gas prices are volatile, and we have no ability to control the price of oil and gas. A continued substantial or extended decline in prices could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and future operating results.\nWe currently have no source of operating revenue. Our financial condition is based solely on our ability to sell equity or debt securities to investors, enter into an additional joint operating agreement or similar strategic relationship with an industry partner, sell interests related to the Concession or borrow funds. We expect that entering into these joint operating or similar relationships would entail transferring a portion of our interest in the Concession to such partner. Such investors would consider the price of oil and gas in making an investment decision. Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing, and operating results. Low oil and gas prices in the future will likely also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we could produce economically and could\nhave a negative effect on our future financial results. Historically, oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile and they are likely to continue to be volatile, with prices fluctuating widely in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u00b7\nthe level of domestic and foreign supplies of oil;\n\u00b7\nthe level of consumer product demand;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u00b7\npolitical conditions in oil producing regions throughout the world;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil production;\n\u00b7\nspeculation as to the future price of oil and natural gas and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;\n\u00b7\nprice and production controls;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic conditions, including embargoes in oil-producing countries or affecting other oil-producing activities, particularly in the Middle East, Africa, Russia and South America;\n\u00b7\ncontinued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including U.S. military operations in the Middle East;\n\u00b7\nthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity;\n\u00b7\nthe price of foreign oil imports;\n\u00b7\nactions of governments;\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations;\n\u00b7\nthe price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels;\n\u00b7\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u00b7\nglobal economic conditions; and\n\u00b7\nthe value of the U.S. dollar, the Euro and fluctuations in exchange rates generally.\nThese factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict oil and gas prices. Our inability to respond appropriately to changes in these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business plan, financial position, results of operations and future cash flows.\nThe terms of the PSC may become subject to renegotiation under certain circumstances, which may have an adverse impact upon our operations and profitability.\nThe PSC provides that should the Guinea government note material differences between provisions of the PSC and international standards or the Guinea Petroleum Code, the parties will renegotiate the relevant articles of the PSC. If the Guinea government identifies material differences between the PSC's provisions and international standards or the Guinea Petroleum Code, there is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate an acceptable modification to the PSC. If\nthe parties are not successful in renegotiating the relevant articles of the PSC, the parties may be required to submit the matter to international arbitration. There is no assurance that any arbitration would be successful or otherwise lead to articles that are more favorable to us than the present articles. Therefore, the results of such negotiations or arbitration could be unfavorable to us and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operation and future cash flows.\nWe may not be able to obtain the additional capital necessary to achieve our business plan.\nOur business is capital intensive and we must invest a significant amount in our activities. We intend to make substantial capital expenditures to find, develop, and produce natural gas and oil reserves.\nAdditional capital could be obtained from a combination of funding sources. The current potential funding sources and the potential adverse effects attributable thereto, include:\n\u00b7\nif the two-year appraisal period for which we have applied is granted, sales or assignments of interests in the Concession and exploration program, which would reduce any future revenues from that program while at the same time offsetting potential expenditures;\n\u00b7\nofferings of equity, equity-linked and convertible debt securities, which would dilute the equity interests of our stockholders;\n\u00b7\ndebt and convertible debt offerings, which would increase our leverage and add to our need for cash to service such debt and which could result in assets being pledged as collateral; and\n\u00b7\nborrowing from financial institutions, which may subject us to certain restrictive covenants, including covenants restricting our ability to raise additional capital or pay dividends.\nIt is difficult to quantify the amount of financing we may need to fund our business plan in the longer term. The amount of funding we may need in the future depends on various factors such as:\n\u00b7\nour financial position;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of exploration and drilling;\n\u00b7\nthe prevailing market price of natural gas and oil; and\n\u00b7\nthe lead time required to bring any discoveries to production.\nIf we do not obtain capital resources in the future it is unlikely that we will be able to continue to pursue exploration offshore Guinea and our financial condition and operations will be adversely affected.\nWe are highly dependent on our management team and consultants, and any failure to retain the services of such parties could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our operations or successfully execute our business plan.\nOur business is dependent on retaining the services of a small number of key personnel of the appropriate caliber as the business develops. Our success is, and will continue to be to a significant extent, dependent upon the expertise and experience of the directors, senior management and certain key consultants, but the retention of their services cannot be guaranteed. The loss of key members of our management team or other highly qualified professionals has adversely affected our ability to effectively manage our overall operations or successfully execute current or future business strategies. If any further member of management, director, or other consultants were to leave our company, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or growth prospects.\nClaims and lawsuits against us may result in adverse outcomes.\nWhile there are currently no pending legal proceedings to which we are a party (or that are, to our knowledge, contemplated by governmental authorities) that we believe will have individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results, from time to time we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business or otherwise. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in any such matters could occur that could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations, including significant monetary damages or limitations on our ability to engage in our business activities. Although we have director and officer insurance, in case such claims arise it may not apply to or fully cover any liabilities we may incur as a result of these lawsuits.\nDrilling wells is speculative and potentially hazardous. Actual costs may be more than our estimates, and may not result in any discoveries. The cost of our recently drilled exploratory well was significantly higher than expected.\nAlthough we would intend to contract what we believe to be a high quality modern drillship rig and reliable contractors for a significant portion of any future drilling technological services, exploring for and developing hydrocarbon reserves involves a high degree of operational and financial risk, which precludes definitive statements as to the time required and costs involved in reaching certain objectives. The budgeted costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often exceeded, especially in the ultra-deep offshore. The cost of our prior exploratory well, the Sabu-1, was higher than we initially expected, primarily due to numerous delays and issues related to mechanical and operational matters on the rig, logistical delays resulting from limited port facilities in Guinea, and an expanded well logging program. In addition, oil was not discovered in commercial quantities. Although the Fatala-1 well was completed within budget, it also did not encounter hydrocarbons in commercial quantities. Unexpected delays and increases in costs associated with any future wells could adversely affect our results of operation, financial position, liquidity and business plans.\nDrilling may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including geological conditions, weather, cost overruns, equipment shortages and mechanical difficulties. Exploratory wells bear a much greater risk of loss than development wells. The successful drilling of an oil well may not be indicative of the potential for the development of a commercially viable field and will not necessarily result in a profit on investment. A variety of factors, both geological and market-related, could cause a well to become uneconomic or only marginally economic.\nThese factors include a variety of operating risks, such as:\n\u00b7\nblowouts, cratering and explosions;\n\u00b7\nmechanical and equipment problems;\n\u00b7\nuncontrolled flows of oil and gas or well fluids;\n\u00b7\nfires;\n\u00b7\nmarine hazards with respect to offshore operations;\n\u00b7\nformations with abnormal pressures;\n\u00b7\npollution and other environmental risks; and\n\u00b7\nweather conditions and natural disasters.\nOffshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks particular to the marine environment, such as capsizing and collisions. Also, offshore operations are subject to damage or loss from adverse weather conditions. Any of these events could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses.\nThe site for the Fatala-1 exploratory well we completed is in the ultra-deep water. Even though this well was drilled safely and on budget, the following risks apply to any future ultra-deep water drilling: Deep-water drilling generally requires more time and more advanced drilling technologies than exploration in shallower waters, involving a higher risk of equipment failure and higher drilling costs. In addition, even if there is a discovery, taking it to production presents risks that we may not be currently aware of. If we participate in the development of new subsea infrastructure and use floating production systems to transport oil from producing wells, these operations may require substantial time for installation or encounter mechanical difficulties and equipment failures that could result in significant liabilities, cost overruns, or delays. Furthermore, deep-water operations generally, and operations in West Africa in particular, lack the physical oilfield service infrastructure that is often present in other regions. As a result, a significant amount of time may elapse between a deep-water discovery and the marketing of the associated oil and natural gas, thus increasing both the financial and operational risks involved with these operations. Because of the lack and high cost of this infrastructure, further discoveries we may make in Guinea may never be economically producible.\nThe cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services, as well as gathering systems and processing facilities, and our dependence on industry contractors generally, could adversely impact us.\nWe are dependent on industry contractors for the success of our oil and gas exploration projects. In particular, our drilling activity offshore Guinea will require that we have access to offshore drilling rigs and contracts with experienced operators of such rigs. The availability and cost of drilling rigs and other equipment and services, and the skilled personnel required to operate those rigs and equipment, is affected by the level and location of drilling activity around the world. An increase in drilling operations worldwide may reduce the availability and increase the cost to us of drilling rigs, other equipment and services, and appropriately experienced drilling contractors. The reduced availability of such equipment and services may delay our ability to discover reserves and higher costs for such equipment and services may increase our costs, both of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and future cash flow. If we succeed in constructing oil wells, we may be required to shut them because access to pipelines, gathering systems or processing facilities may be limited or unavailable. If that were to occur, we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until arrangements were made to deliver the production to market, which could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOperator's responsibilities pose high risk in terms of organizing operations safely, in an environmentally responsible way and within the terms prescribed by the applicable legislation.\nUnder the terms of the PSC, SCS is designated as the Operator. SCS will be liable for the obligations under the PSC to the Government of the Republic of Guinea. Due to the complexity of the oil and gas operations of drilling deep-water exploration wells, we are unable to provide assurances that complications during drilling operations will not occur, whether we will be able to cover claims that may arise, and whether we will be able to carry sufficient catastrophic well insurance to adequately cover us.\nWe are exposed to the failure or non-performance of commercial counterparties.\nOur operations will be dependent on certain third parties with whom we have commercial agreements (such as drilling contractors and the parties responsible for transporting and/or storing our production) for our future exploration, development, production, sales or other activities. The efficiency, timeliness and quality of contract performance by third party providers are largely beyond our direct control. If one or more of these third parties fails to meet its contractual obligations to us, or if such services are temporarily or permanently unavailable (for example, as a result of technical problems or industrial action), or not available on commercially acceptable terms, we may experience a material adverse effect to our business, results of operations, financial condition and future cash flow. In addition, as a named party under the PSC, we could be held liable for the environmental, health and safety impacts arising out of the activities of our drilling project management contractor or any other third-party service provider contracted by us or on our behalf, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and future cash flow.\nParticipants in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous laws that can affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nExploration and production activities in the oil and gas industry are subject to local laws and regulations. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations, particularly in respect of the following matters:\n\u00b7\nlicenses for drilling operations;\n\u00b7\ntax increases, including retroactive claims;\n\u00b7\nunitization of oil accumulations;\n\u00b7\nlocal content requirements (including the mandatory use of local partners and vendors); and\n\u00b7\nenvironmental requirements and obligations, including investigation and/or remediation activities.\nUnder these and other laws and regulations, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage and other types of damages. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, new laws and regulations may be enacted and current laws and regulations could change or their interpretations could change, in ways that could substantially increase our costs. These risks may be higher in the developing countries in which we conduct our operations, where there could be a lack of clarity or lack of consistency in the application of these laws and regulations. Any resulting liabilities, penalties, suspensions or terminations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, the explosion and sinking in April 2010 of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig during operations on the Macondo exploration well in the Gulf of Mexico, and the resulting oil spill, may have increased certain of the risks faced by those drilling for oil in deep-water regions, including increased industry standards, governmental regulation and enforcement, and less favorable investor perception of the risk-adjusted benefits of deep-water offshore drilling.\nThe occurrence of any of these factors, or the continuation thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or future results of operations.\nOur insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover losses, or we could be subject to uninsured liabilities which could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThere are circumstances where insurance will not cover, or where it will be not sufficient to cover, the consequences of an event, or where we may become liable for costs incurred in events or incidents against which we either cannot insure or may elect not to have insured (whether on account of prohibitive premium costs or for other commercial reasons). Further, insurance covering certain matters (such as sovereign risk, terrorism and many environmental risks) may not be available to us. Moreover, we may be subject to large excess payments in the event a third party has a valid claim against us, and therefore may not be entitled to recover the full extent of our loss, or may decide that it is not economical to seek to do so. The realization of any significant liabilities in connection with our future activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future cash flow.\nThere are risks associated with the drilling of oil and natural gas wells which could significantly reduce our revenues or cause substantial losses, impairing our future operating results. We may become subject to liability for pollution, blow-outs or other hazards, including those arising out of the activities of our third-party contractors. We intend to obtain insurance with respect to certain of these hazards, but such insurance likely will have limitations that may prevent us from recovering the full extent of such liabilities. The payment by us of such liabilities could reduce the funds available to us or could, in an extreme case, result in a total loss of our properties and assets. Moreover, oil and natural gas production operations are also subject to all the risks typically associated with such operations, including premature decline of reservoirs and the invasion of water into producing formations.\nWe may incur a variety of costs to engage in business transactions, and the anticipated benefits of those transactions may never be realized.\nAs a part of our business strategy, we enter into business transactions, or significant investments in, other assets, particularly those that would allow us to produce oil and natural gas and generate revenue to fund our exploration activities. Any future acquisitions would be accompanied by risks such as:\n\u00b7\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns;\n\u00b7\nour potential inability to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful development of the asset or assets acquired;\n\u00b7\nimpairment of our relationship with our existing employees if we cannot hire employees to staff any new operations and our existing employees are required to staff both old and new operations; and\n\u00b7\nmaintenance of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate any business, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future, and our failure to do so could harm our business.\nWe do not have reserve reports for the Concession and our expectations as to oil and gas reserves are uncertain and may vary substantially from any actual production.\nWe neither have reserves nor any reserve reports for the Concession. A reserve report is the estimated quantities of oil and gas based on reports prepared by third party reserve engineers. Reserve reporting is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Expectations as to oil and gas reserves are uncertain and may vary substantially from any actual production.\nRisks Relating to Operating in Guinea\nWe operate in the Republic of Guinea, a country which is considered a high-risk jurisdiction for corruption; such corruption could impair our ability to do business in the future or result in significant fines or penalties.\nWe have been the Operator in a Concession offshore the Republic of Guinea, a country where corruption has been known to exist. There is a risk of violating either the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, laws or legislation promulgated pursuant to the 1997 OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, or Guinea anti-corruption regulations that generally prohibit the making of improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business.\nThe Republic of Guinea is largely a cash-based society and that creates additional internal control and related risks. We have been subject to investigations by the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission under the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") into how we obtained or retained the original Concession and, as a result, expended approximately $12.8 million in legal fees in working with the US Government. While those matters were resolved in 2015, should the DOJ, the SEC, or the Republic of Guinea open additional investigations regarding prior or current activities in the Republic Guinea or elsewhere, we do not have the financial ability to bear the costs related to any additional investigations and are unable to predict whether we would be able to raise the funds to properly defend the Company.\nGeopolitical instability where we operate subjects us to political, economic and other uncertainties.\nWe conduct business in Guinea, which is in a region of the world where there have been prior civil wars, revolutions, coup d\u2019\u00e9tats and internecine conflicts. There is the risk of political violence and increased social tension in Guinea as a result of the past political upheaval, and there is a risk of civil unrest, crime and labor unrest at times. Since\n2010, democratic elections have been held, a president was democratically elected and re-elected. While these developments indicate that the political situation in Guinea is improving, external or internal political forces potentially could create a political or military climate that might cause a change in political leadership, the outbreak of hostilities, or civil unrest. Such uncertainties could result in our having to cease our Guinea operations and result in the loss or delay of our rights under the PSC.\nFurther, we face political and economic risks and other uncertainties with respect to our operations, which may include, among other things:\n\u00b7\nloss of future revenue, property and equipment, as a result of hazards such as expropriation, war, acts of terrorism, insurrection and other political risks;\n\u00b7\nincreases in taxes and governmental royalties;\n\u00b7\nunilateral renegotiation or cancellation of contracts by governmental entities;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations;\n\u00b7\nchanges in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies; and\n\u00b7\ncurrency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations.\nRealization of any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or growth prospects. The Consortium\u2019s operations in Guinea also may be adversely affected by laws and policies of multiple jurisdictions.\nAn epidemic of the Ebola virus disease in Guinea could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition.\nThere was an outbreak of the Ebola virus disease in Guinea in 2013 to 2015. While the World Health Organization declared Guinea Ebola free on December 29, 2015, sporadic new cases of infection have occurred, and any future outbreak of the Ebola virus will adversely affect our business operations and financial condition.\nAny drilling activities in Guinea will require safe access to the Conakry airport and port as well as other infrastructure in Guinea. If there is another Ebola virus outbreak, drilling plans will likely be delayed, could be compromised and costs of operations will be increased, which additional costs we may not be able to cover in a timely manner and thus we could lose our participating interest in the Guinea Concession. Further, if contractors or subcontractors impose travel bans or personnel refuse to travel to Guinea, drilling plans will be further delayed or interrupted after commencement. It is likely that the cost of any services could be significantly higher than planned which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, business, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to governmental regulations, the cost of compliance with which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and future cash flow.\nOil and gas operations in Guinea will be subject to government regulation and to interruption or termination by governmental authorities on account of ecological and other considerations. It is impossible to predict future government proposals that might be enacted into law, future interpretation of existing laws or future amendments to the Guinea Petroleum Code or any other laws, or the effect those new or amended laws or changes in interpretation of existing laws might have on us. Restrictions on oil and gas activities, such as production restrictions, price controls, tax increases and pollution and environmental controls may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and future cash flows.\nSocial, economic and health conditions in Guinea may adversely affect our business, results of operation, financial condition and future cash flow.\nAs all of our potential revenue generating assets are currently located in Guinea, our operations are dependent on the economic and political conditions prevailing in Guinea. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks associated with conducting business in and with a foreign country, including the risks of changes in the country\u2019s laws and policies (including those relating to taxation, royalties, acquisitions, disposals, imports and exports, currency, environmental protection, management of natural resources, exploration and development of mines, labor and safety standards, and historical and cultural preservation). The costs associated with compliance with these laws and regulations are substantial, and possible future laws and regulations as well as changes to existing laws and regulations could impose additional costs on us, require us to incur additional capital expenditures and/or impose restrictions on or suspensions of our operations and delays in the development of our assets.\nFurther, these laws and regulations may allow government authorities and private parties to bring legal claims based on damages to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our past and current operations and could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, penalties or other civil or criminal sanctions. If material, these compliance costs, claims or fines could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or growth prospects. In addition, Guinea has high levels of poverty, crime, unemployment and an undeveloped health care system.\nThe legal and judicial system in Guinea is relatively undeveloped and subject to frequent changes, and we may be exposed to similar risks if we operate in certain other jurisdictions.\nGuinea has a less developed legal and judicial system than more established economies which could result in risks such as: (i) effective legal redress in the courts of such jurisdictions, whether in respect of a breach of contract, law or regulation, or in an ownership dispute, being more difficult to obtain; (ii) a higher degree of discretion on the part of Governmental authorities who may be susceptible to corruption; (iii) the lack of judicial or administrative guidance on interpreting applicable rules and regulations; (iv) inconsistencies or conflicts between and within various laws, regulations, decrees, orders and resolutions; or (v) relative inexperience of the judiciary and courts in such matters. In Guinea and certain other jurisdictions, the commitment of local business people, government officials and agencies and the judicial system to abide by legal requirements and negotiated agreements may be more uncertain, creating particular concerns with respect to the Concession or other licenses, permits or approvals required by us for the operation of our business, which may be susceptible to revision or cancellation, and legal redress may be uncertain or delayed. There can be no assurance that joint ventures, licenses, license applications or other legal arrangements will not be adversely affected by the actions of government authorities or others, and the effectiveness of and enforcement of such arrangements in these jurisdictions cannot be assured.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nYou could lose all of your investment.\nAn investment in our securities is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Potential investors should be aware that the value of an investment in the Company may go down as well as up. In addition, there can be no certainty that the market value of an investment in the Company will fully reflect its underlying value. You could lose your entire investment.\nWe have obtained shareholder approval for a 1-for-2 to 1-for-6 reverse stock split, and in the event that our board of directors decides to effectuate such reverse split, it could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock and market capitalization.\nWe may effectuate a between 1-for-2 and 1-for-6 reverse split of our common stock. On June 30, 2017, our board of directors approved a reverse stock split in that range and directed the Company to solicit the requisite votes of the stockholders of the Company for their approval of such reverse stock split by written consents in lieu of a special meeting. On August 10, 2017, we obtained shareholder approval for a reverse stock split in that range, with the exact reverse split\nratio to be determined within that range by the board of directors in its sole discretion, and with such reverse stock split to be effective at such date and time, if at all, as determined by the board of directors in its sole discretion.\nA reverse stock split is often viewed negatively by the market and, consequently, can lead to a decrease in our overall market capitalization. If the per share market price does not increase proportionately as a result of the reverse stock split, then the value of our Company as measured by our market capitalization will be reduced, perhaps significantly. This would also significantly reduce the number of shares of our common stock that are outstanding, and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected and you may find it more difficult to purchase or sell shares of our common stock.\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common or preferred stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common or preferred stock.\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, which would result in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders and the purchasers of our common stock offered hereby. The Company is authorized to issue an aggregate of 87,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of \"blank check\" preferred stock. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of our common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock. We will need to raise additional capital in the near future to meet our working capital needs, and there can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with these capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price you paid for your stock.\nIf the stock purchase agreement with CLNG closes, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution of your ownership interest, and our stock price could be negatively impacted.\nIf the stock purchase agreement with CLNG closes (of which there is no assurance), we will issue to them 40,000,000 shares of common stock, and current shareholders will experience immediate and substantial dilution. If this purchase is completed, CLNG or its affiliate will own approximately 53% of our then outstanding common stock, and existing stockholders will hold only approximately 47%. The issuance of these shares, or other factors relating to the transaction, could cause our stock price to decline, perhaps significantly.\nIf the stock purchase agreement with CLNG closes, CLNG or its affiliate will own a majority of our outstanding voting stock and will have effective control of the Company and could preclude other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nIf the stock purchase agreement with CLNG is completed, CLNG or its affiliate will own approximately 53% of our outstanding common stock and will have the ability to elect all of our directors as well as to exercise a controlling influence over other matters requiring stockholder approval, including approval of significant corporate transactions and dilutive share issuances, and may have significant control over our management and policies.\nIf the transaction closes, CLNG has informed us that it or its affiliate intends to appoint representatives who will form a majority of our board of directors, but no specific agreement has yet been entered into in this respect, nor have such director candidates been definitively identified. Such majority of directors would be able to effectively control the Company, by directing its business and controlling its finances, future issuances of stock and other securities, and otherwise. A new board of directors could decide to change, expand or contract the business plan of the Company in its discretion.\nWhile the stock purchase agreement provides that Ray Leonard will remain President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company, and Jason Davis will remain Chief Financial Officer, they may be removed as officers by the board (subject, in the case of Mr. Leonard, to the provisions of his employment agreement), and Mr. Leonard can be\nremoved by, or not re-elected by, the stockholders in accordance with our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law.\nFuture sales of our common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable for our common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, may cause our stock price to decline and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us.\nIf our existing stockholders or warrant or option holders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the price of our common stock could decline. The perception in the market that these sales may occur could also cause the price of our common stock to decline. Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement we have filed to register for resale certain shares of common stock by our stockholders or we could elect to file with respect to any other outstanding shares of common stock, any sales of those shares or any perception in the market that such sales may occur could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. As of the date of effectiveness of such registration statement, such shares registered for resale will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act of 1933.\nThe ability of our board of directors to issue additional stock may prevent or make more difficult certain transactions, including a sale or merger of the Company.\nOur board of directors is authorized to issue up to 87,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock with powers, rights and preferences designated by it. (A total of 595 shares of Series A Preferred Stock are currently outstanding.) Shares of voting or convertible preferred stock could be issued, or rights to purchase such shares could be issued, to create voting impediments or to frustrate persons seeking to effect a takeover or otherwise gain control of the Company. The ability of the board of directors to issue such additional shares of preferred stock, with rights and preferences it deems advisable, could discourage an attempt by a party to acquire control of the Company by tender offer or other means. Such issuances could therefore deprive stockholders of benefits that could result from such an attempt, such as the realization of a premium over the market price for their shares in a tender offer or the temporary increase in market price that such an attempt could cause. Moreover, the issuance of such additional shares of preferred stock to persons friendly to the board of directors could make it more difficult to remove incumbent managers and directors from office even if such change were to be favorable to stockholders generally.\nThere currently is a limited market for our common stock and there can be no assurance that an active public market will ever develop. Failure to develop or maintain an active trading market could negatively affect the value of our common stock and make it difficult or impossible for you to sell your shares.\nThere is currently only a limited public market for shares of our common stock, and an active trading market may never develop. Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets. The OTC Markets is a thinly traded market and lacks the liquidity of certain other public markets with which some investors may have more experience. We may not ever be able to satisfy the listing requirements for our common stock to be listed on a national securities exchange, which is often a more widely-traded and liquid market. Some, but not all, of the factors which may delay or prevent the listing of our common stock on a more widely-traded and liquid market include the following: our stockholders' equity may be insufficient; the market value of our outstanding securities may be too low; our net income from operations may be too low; our common stock may not be sufficiently widely held; we may not be able to secure market makers for our common stock; and we may fail to meet the rules and requirements mandated by the several exchanges and markets to have our common stock listed. Should we fail to satisfy the initial listing standards of the national exchanges, or our common stock is otherwise rejected for listing, and remains listed on the OTC Markets or is suspended from the OTC Markets, the trading price of our common stock could suffer and the trading market for our common stock may be less liquid and our common stock price may be subject to increased volatility.\nWe have not applied, and currently do not intend to apply, for the listing of our common stock on any national securities exchange. We do not currently meet the listing criteria of any such exchange, and no assurance can be given that we will at any time in the future.\nThe price of our common stock historically has been volatile. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell your common stock, and the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe closing price for our common stock has varied between a high of $2.80 on January 4, 2017 and a low of $0.37 on July 26, 2016 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Since June 30, 2017, the closing price for our common stock has varied between a high of $2.05 and a low of $0.06. On November 14, 2017, the closing price of our common stock was $0.14. This volatility may affect the price at which an investor could sell the common stock, and the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the other factors discussed in \u201c- Risks Relating to Our Business and the Industry in Which We Operate\u201d; variations in our quarterly operating results from our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors; downward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates; and announcement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments.\nOur common stock is currently subject to the \"penny stock\" rules of the SEC and the trading market in the securities is limited, which makes transactions in the stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in the stock.\nRule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act establishes the definition of a \"penny stock,\" for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (a) that a broker or dealer approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks; and (b) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: (a) obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and (b) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: (a) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and (b) confirms that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \"penny stock\" rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our common stock.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker or dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nOur stock may be traded infrequently and in low volumes, so you may be unable to sell your shares at or near the quoted bid prices if you need to sell your shares.\nUntil our common stock is listed on a national securities exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or The Nasdaq Stock Market, we expect our common stock to remain eligible for quotation on the OTC Markets, or on another over-the-counter quotation system. In those venues, however, the shares of our common stock may trade infrequently and in low volumes, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. An investor may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock or to sell his or her shares at or near bid prices or at all. In addition, if we fail to meet the criteria set forth in SEC regulations, various requirements would be imposed by law on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, such regulations may\ndeter broker-dealers from recommending or selling our common stock, which may further affect the liquidity of our common stock. This would also make it more difficult for us to raise capital.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock. Any return on your investment will likely be limited to the value of our common stock.\nCash dividends have never been declared or paid on our common stock, and we do not anticipate such a declaration or payment for the foreseeable future. We expect to use future earnings, if any, to fund business growth. Therefore, stockholders will not receive any funds absent a sale of their shares of common stock. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates. We cannot assure stockholders of a positive return on their investment when they sell their shares, nor can we assure that stockholders will not lose the entire amount of their investment.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe qualify as a \"smaller reporting company\" (meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company, and we have a public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter), which allows us to take advantage of a number of exemptions from SEC disclosure requirements in our periodic reports and proxy statements, including, among other things, simplified executive compensation disclosures, only being required to provide two (rather than three) years of audited financial statements, and not being required to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as a \"smaller reporting company\" may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects and may cause some investors to find our common stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could adversely impact the market price of our shares.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are governed by anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\") that prohibit certain publicly-traded Delaware corporations from engaging in a business combination with anyone who owns at least 15% of its common stock for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired the 15% ownership, unless the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the corporation contain a provision expressly electing not to be governed by this anti-takeover statute, the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner, or the corporation does not have a class of voting stock that is listed on a national securities exchange or held by more than 2,000 stockholders of record. We are currently not subject to these restrictions; however, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws do not contain a provision electing not to be governed by this statute, and once our common stock is listed on a national securities exchange or held by more than 2,000 stockholders of record, we will become subject to these restrictions, which may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nCertain other provisions of Delaware law and of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders, or could discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult to replace or remove our Board of Directors. These provisions include:\n\u009f\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u009f\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director;\n\u009f\na requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by the chairperson of the board of directors, the chief executive officer or by the board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of directors,\n\u009f\nan advance notice requirement for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u009f\nthe authority of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as our board of directors may determine; and\n\u009f\nelimination of personal liability for breaches of fiduciary duty as a director, to the extent permitted under the Delaware law.\nThese restrictions, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nAny failure to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting could materially adversely affect us.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to include in our annual reports on Form 10-K an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, at such time, if any, as we are no longer a \"smaller reporting company,\" our independent registered public accounting firm will have to attest to and report on management's assessment of the effectiveness of such internal control over financial reporting. Based upon the last evaluation conducted as of June 30, 2017, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of such date to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017 and continued through June 30, 2017 and thereafter through the date of this filing, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During the fiscal year 2017, the Company has experienced turnover in its accounting group and as of June 30, 2017, it lacked a sufficient number of competent accounting personnel. This material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting had a material adverse impact on our quarterly and annual financial close process and reporting. The Company is in the process of remediating this weakness by adding additional competent accounting personnel.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to prevent or detect fraud or provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. This could result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could negatively affect the price of our common stock.\nIn particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and (if required in future) our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404(b). Our compliance with Section 404(b) may require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group. We may need to retain the services of additional accounting and financial staff or consultants with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge to satisfy the ongoing requirements of Section 404(b). We intend to review the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and make any changes management determines appropriate, including to achieve compliance with Section 404(b) by the date on which we are required to so comply.\n***\nIN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE RISKS, BUSINESSES ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO RISKS NOT FORESEEN OR FULLY APPRECIATED BY MANAGEMENT.
