{"cik": "861838", "company": "IDERA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before purchasing our common stock. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these and currently unknown risks or uncertainties. In that case, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our securities.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe will need additional financing, which may be difficult to obtain on terms attractive to us or at all.\nWe expect that we will need to raise additional funds in order to complete the development of, seek regulatory approvals for and commercialization of tilsotolimod and to continue to fund our operations. We are seeking and expect to continue to seek additional funding through financings of equity or debt securities, collaborations, or the sale or license of assets. We believe the key factors that will affect our ability to obtain funding are: (i) the results of our clinical development activities in our tilsotolimod program or any other drug candidates we develop on the timelines anticipated; (ii) the time and expense required to submit an NDA for tilsotolimod; (iii) the cost, timing, and outcome of regulatory reviews; (iv) the receptivity of the capital markets to financings by biotechnology companies generally and companies with drug candidates and technologies similar to ours specifically; (v) receptivity of the capital markets to any in-licensing, product acquisition or other transaction we may enter into; and (vi) ability to enter into additional collaborations and the success of such collaborations.\nFinancing may not be available to us when we need it, or on favorable or acceptable terms, or at all. We could be required to seek funds through collaborative alliances or through other means that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, drug candidates or drugs that we would otherwise pursue on our own. In addition, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, or an equity financing that involves existing stockholders may cause a concentration of ownership. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, and are likely to include rights that are senior to the holders of our common stock. Any additional debt or equity financing may contain terms which are not favorable to us or to our stockholders, such as liquidation and other preferences, or liens or other restrictions on our assets. As discussed in Note 14 to the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, additional equity financings may also result in cumulative changes in ownership over a three-year period in excess of 50% which would limit the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that we may utilize in any one year. If we are unable to obtain adequate funding on a timely basis or at all, we will be required to terminate, modify or delay clinical trials of tilsotolimod, delay the NDA submission of tilsotolimod, or relinquish rights to portions of our technology, drug candidates and/or products.\nWe expect that we will continue to incur substantial and increasing net losses in the foreseeable future.\nFrom January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2020, we incurred losses of $573.4 million. These losses, among other things, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders' equity, total assets and working capital. Additionally, we have never had any products of our own available for commercial sale and have received no revenues from the sale of drugs. Substantially all of our revenues have been from collaborative and license agreements. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including clinical trials, and have not completed development of any drug candidates. Due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses, whether or when any of our drug candidates will become commercially available, or when we will become profitable, if at all. We expect to incur substantial operating losses in future periods.\nEven if we succeed in receiving marketing approval for and commercializing tilsotolimod or any other product candidate, we will continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenditures to develop and market additional potential indications or products. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nRisks Relating to Our Business, Strategy, and Industry\nWe are depending heavily on the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our lead TLR-targeted drug candidate, tilsotolimod. If we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize tilsotolimod or any other drug candidate, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business may be materially harmed.\nWe have made and intend to continue to make a significant investment of our time and financial resources in the development and commercialization of tilsotolimod. Our ability to generate product revenues will depend heavily on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize tilsotolimod. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval and successfully commercialize tilsotolimod, our business would be materially and adversely impacted. Even if tilsotolimod receives regulatory approval, we will incur significant expenses to support its commercialization and launch, which investment may never be realized if sales are insufficient.\nWe are developing tilsotolimod in combination with other immuno-modulatory compounds and chemotherapeutic agents and our efforts may not be successful or result in any approved and marketable products.\nTilsotolimod is being developed for administration via intratumoral injection in combination with systemically administered checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of various solid tumors, including (i) anti-PD1 refractory metastatic melanoma in combination with ipilimumab, (ii) microsatellite stable colorectal cancer in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab, and (iii) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in combination with other oncology products. While we have evaluated the safety profile of tilsotolimod as a single agent via intratumoral injection in previous trials, and as marketed products the safety profiles of ipilimumab and nivolumab are each known, the safety profile of the combination of tilsotolimod with ipilimumab and/or nivolumab is still being evaluated. Further, under the AbbVie Agreement, AbbVie is conducting a clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tilsotolimod with other products. These factors may result in participating subjects experiencing serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or exposure to unacceptable health risks requiring us or AbbVie to suspend or terminate any clinical trials which are being conducted with tilsotolimod and other therapeutic agents.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our drug candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the U.S.\nIn addition, some of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for drug candidates that treat the same indications as our drug candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors' drug candidates. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials could also require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays may result in increased development costs for our drug candidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nIf our clinical trials are unsuccessful, delayed or terminated, we may not be able to develop and commercialize our drug candidates.\nClinical trials are lengthy, complex, and expensive processes with uncertain results. We may not be able to complete any clinical trial of an investigational product within any specified time period. Moreover, clinical trials may not show our investigational products to have an acceptable safety and efficacy profile. The FDA or other equivalent foreign regulatory agencies may not allow us to complete these trials or commence and complete any other clinical trials.\nNumerous unforeseen events may occur during, or as a result of, preclinical testing, nonclinical testing or the clinical trial process that could delay or inhibit the ability to receive regulatory approval or to commercialize drug products. For example, setbacks in clinical trials may result in enhanced scrutiny by regulators or institutional review boards (\u201cIRBs\u201d) of clinical trials of our drug candidates, including our TLR-targeted drug candidates, which could result in regulators or IRBs prohibiting the commencement of clinical trials, requiring additional nonclinical studies as a precondition to commencing clinical trials or imposing restrictions on the design or scope of clinical trials that could slow enrollment of trials, increase the costs of trials or limit the significance of the results of trials. Such setbacks could also adversely impact the desire of investigators to enroll patients in, and the desire of patients to enroll in, clinical trials of our drug candidates.\nOther events that could delay or inhibit conduct of our clinical trials include: (i) nonclinical or clinical data may not be readily interpreted, which may lead to delays and/or misinterpretation; (ii) our nonclinical tests, including toxicology studies, or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results; (iii) we might have to suspend or terminate our clinical trials if the participating subjects experience serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or are exposed to unacceptable health risks; (iv) regulators or IRBs may hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements, issues identified through inspections of manufacturing or clinical trial operations or clinical trial sites; (v) we, along with our collaborators and subcontractors, may not employ, in any capacity, persons who have been debarred under the FDA's Application Integrity Policy, or similar policy under foreign regulatory authorities; (vi) we or our contract manufacturers may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our drug candidates for use in clinical trials; (vii) the cost of our clinical trials may be greater than we currently anticipate making continuation and/or completion improbable; and (viii) our drug candidates may not cause the desired effects or may cause undesirable side effects or our drug candidates may have other unexpected characteristics.\nIn conducting clinical trials, we cannot be certain that any planned clinical trial will begin on time, if at all. Delays in commencing clinical trials of potential products could increase our drug candidate development costs, delay any potential revenues, reduce the potential length of patent exclusivity and reduce the probability that a potential product will receive regulatory approval. Significant clinical trial delays also could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our drug candidates.\nInterim, \u201ctop-line,\u201d and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may materially differ, including as a result of audit and verification procedures, from final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose preliminary or top-line data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials, based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. Top-line or preliminary results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Top-line data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, top-line data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.\nFrom time to time, we may also disclose interim data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available or as patients from our clinical trials continue other treatments for their disease. Differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects. Further, disclosure of interim data by us or by our competitors could result in volatility in the price of our common stock. In addition, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product and our company in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure.\nThe technologies on which we rely are unproven and may not result in any approved and marketable products.\nOur technologies or therapeutic approaches are relatively new and unproven. We have focused our efforts on the research and development of RNA- and DNA-based compounds, or oligonucleotides, targeted to TLRs. The results of preclinical studies with TLR-targeted compounds may not be indicative of results that may be obtained in clinical trials, and results we have obtained in the clinical trials we have conducted to date may not be predictive of results in subsequent clinical trials. Further, the chemical and pharmacological properties of TLR-targeted compounds may not be fully recognized in preclinical studies and small-scale clinical trials, and such compounds may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways that we have not yet identified. As a result of these factors, we may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval to market any product.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing drugs before or more successfully than us.\nThere are many other companies, public and private, actively engaged in discovery, development, and commercializing products and technologies that may compete with our drug candidate and program, including TLR-targeted compounds as well as non-TLR-targeted therapeutics. Some potentially competitive products have been in development or commercialized for years. Many of the marketed products have been accepted by the medical community, patients, and third-party payors. Our ability to compete may be affected by the previous adoption of such products by the medical community, patients, and third-party payors.\nWe recognize that other companies, including large pharmaceutical companies, may be developing or have plans to develop products and technologies that may compete with ours. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we have and/or may have significantly greater experience than we have in undertaking preclinical studies and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products for use in health care and manufacturing, and marketing and selling approved products. We anticipate that the competition with our drug candidates and technologies will be based on a number of factors including product efficacy, safety, availability, and price. The timing of market introduction of our drug candidates and competitive products will also affect competition among products. We expect the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the clinical trials and approval processes, and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market to be important competitive factors.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, such as the recent COVID-19 global pandemic, including disruptions to our clinical trials or the delay of regulatory approvals.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the ongoing worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2019, COVID-19 emerged and in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. The spread of this pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty globally. This has resulted in an economic downturn and may disrupt our business and delay our clinical trials and regulatory approvals. Quarantines and similar government orders have been enacted in each of the geographies in which we are conducting our clinical trials. The patient populations that are eligible for our clinical trials are immune-compromised and are at higher risk for becoming infected with COVID-19. As COVID-19 affects the parts of the world where we are conducting our clinical trials, and the patients involved with these clinical trials become infected with COVID-19, we may have more adverse events and deaths in our clinical trials as a result. Additionally, if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA from conducting its regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Such concerns could also affect the ability of our personnel to perform their normal responsibilities and could result in temporary closures of our facilities.\nThe global pandemic of COVID-19 continues to evolve. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, any one or a combination of these events could have an adverse effect on the operation of and results from our clinical trials, which could prevent or delay us from obtaining approval for tilsotolimod, or on our employee resources.\nAs a small biopharmaceutical-focused company with limited resources, we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nWe are a small company with 32 full-time employees as of December 31, 2020. Any future growth will require hiring a number of qualified personnel. Also, because of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we face intense competition for qualified employees and consultants from biopharmaceutical companies, research organizations and academic institutions. Failure to attract and retain qualified personnel would materially harm our ability to compete effectively and grow our business.\nIf we lose any of our officers or key employees, our management and technical expertise could be weakened significantly.\nOur success largely depends on the skills, experience, and efforts of our executive officers, especially our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Vincent Milano. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies covering any\nof our employees. The loss of any of our executive officers could weaken our management and technical expertise significantly and harm our business.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval and Marketing and Other Compliance Matters\nEven if we complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, the marketing approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our drug candidates.\nWe are not permitted to market our drug candidates in the U.S. or in other countries until we, or any future collaborators, receive approval of an NDA from the FDA or marketing approval from applicable regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. The approval process is lengthy, often taking a number of years, is uncertain, and is expensive. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the drug candidate's safety and efficacy. Information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities is also required. Any delay in obtaining or failure to obtain required approvals could materially adversely affect our ability or that of any collaborators we may have to generate revenue from the particular drug candidate, which likely would result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely impact our stock price.\nOur failure to obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent our drug candidates from being marketed abroad.\nWe, and any future collaborators, must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional studies. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside of the U.S., it is required that the drug be approved for reimbursement before the drug can be approved for sale in that country. We, and any future collaborators, may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside of the U.S. does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions or by the FDA.\nAdditionally, on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) withdrew from the E.U. (Brexit), thereby triggering a transition period that ended December 31, 2020. There is currently considerable uncertainty on regulatory processes in Europe and the European Economic Area. The lack of clarity about which E.U. rules and regulations the U.K. would replace or replicate, such as rules and regulations relating to trade (including the importation and exportation of pharmaceuticals), clinical research, and intellectual property, could negatively impact our business, including by restricting our ability to generate revenue in these jurisdictions.\nEven if we, or any future collaborators, obtain marketing approvals for our drug candidates, the terms of approvals and ongoing regulation of our drugs may limit how we, or they, manufacture and market our drugs, which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nWe, and any future collaborators, must comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any of our drug candidates for which we or they obtain marketing approval. Such promotional communications are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the drug\u2019s approved labeling. Thus, we, and any future collaborators, may not be able to promote any drugs we develop for indications or uses for which they are not approved.\nIn addition, manufacturers of approved drugs and those manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMPs, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and reporting requirements. We, our contract manufacturers, our future collaborators and their contract manufacturers could be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, and other regulatory authorities to monitor and ensure compliance with cGMPs.\nAccordingly, assuming we, or our future collaborators, receive marketing approval for one or more of our drug candidates, we, and our future collaborators, and our and their contract manufacturers will continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control.\nIf we, and our future collaborators, are not able to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, we, and our future collaborators, could have the marketing approvals for our drugs withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our, or our future collaborators\u2019, ability to market any future drugs could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability. Further, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nMoreover, legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict promotional activities relating to our drugs. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our drug candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by Congress of the FDA's approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us and any collaborators to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nAny of our drug candidates for which we, or our future collaborators, obtain marketing approval in the future could be subject to post-approval restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we, and our future collaborators, may be subject to substantial penalties if we, or they, fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we, or they, experience unanticipated problems with our drugs following approval.\nAny of our drug candidates for which we, or our future collaborators, obtain marketing approval in the future, as well as the manufacturing processes, post-approval studies and measures, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such drug, among other things, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a drug candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including the requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, which could include requirements for a restricted distribution system.\nThe FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a drug. The FDA and other agencies, including the DOJ, closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure that they are manufactured, marketed and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if we, or our future collaborators, do not market any of our drug candidates for which we, or they, receive marketing approval for only their approved indications, we, or they, may be subject to warnings or enforcement action for off-label promotion.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our drugs or their manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including: (i) litigation involving patients taking our drug; (ii) restrictions on such drugs, manufacturers or manufacturing processes; (iii) restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a drug; (iv) restrictions on drug distribution or use; (v) requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials; (vi) warning letters or untitled letters; (vii) withdrawal of the drugs from the market; (viii) refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit; (ix) recall of drugs; (x) fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues; (xi) suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals; (xii) damage to relationships with any potential collaborators; (xiii) unfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation; (xiv) refusal to permit the import or export of drugs; (xv) drug seizure; or (xvi) injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for applications of our TLR drug candidates.\nThe FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of seven years of marketing exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nIn June 2017, the FDA granted us orphan drug designation for tilsotolimod for the treatment of melanoma Stages IIb to IV. However, there can be no assurance that we will obtain orphan drug designation or exclusivity for any other\ndisease indications for which we develop tilsotolimod, or for our other drug candidates. Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.\nA fast track designation by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and does not increase the likelihood that drug candidates will receive marketing approval.\nIn November 2017, the FDA granted us fast track designation for tilsotolimod for the treatment of anti-PD1 refractory metastatic melanoma in combination with ipilimumab therapy. However, even with fast track designation, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. Additionally, we intend to seek fast track designation for other applications of our drug candidates. The FDA has broad discretion whether to grant this designation, so even if we believe a particular drug candidate is eligible for this designation, we cannot assure you that the FDA would decide to grant it.\nA breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for any application of our drug candidates may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that those drug candidates will receive marketing approval.\nWe may seek a breakthrough therapy designation for some applications of our drug candidates. Designation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. The receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a drug candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our drug candidates qualify as breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the products no longer meet the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.\nWe have only limited experience in regulatory affairs and our drug candidates are based on new technologies; these factors may affect our ability or the time we require to obtain necessary regulatory approvals.\nWe have never obtained regulatory approval for, or commercialized, a drug. It is possible that the FDA may refuse to accept any or all of our planned NDAs for substantive review or may conclude, after review of our data, that our applications are insufficient to obtain regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates. The FDA may also require that we conduct additional clinical or manufacturing validation studies, which may be costly and time-consuming, and submit that data before it will reconsider our applications. Depending on the extent of these or any other FDA required studies, approval of any NDA that we submit may be significantly delayed, possibly for years, or may require us to expend more resources than we have available or can secure.\nWe are subject to extensive and costly governmental regulation, the violation of which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nOur product candidates are subject and any future commercial products will be subject to costly, extensive and rigorous domestic and foreign government regulation, as discussed under the caption \u201cGovernment Regulation\u201d within Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, our future arrangements with third party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. These include, but are not limited to, the following: the Anti-Kickback Statute; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; the False Claims Act; privacy laws such as HIPAA; transparency requirements; and analogous state and foreign laws. Additionally, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business\npractices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nWe depend on information technology, infrastructure and data to conduct our business. Any significant disruption, or cyber-attacks, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent upon information technology, infrastructure and data. Computer systems, including ours and those of our suppliers, partners and service providers, contain sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and are vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, cyber-attacks (both malicious and random) and other natural or man-made incidents or disasters, which may be prolonged or go undetected. Such events are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. A significant interruption of our information technology could adversely affect our ability to manage and keep our operations running efficiently and effectively. An incident that results in a wider or sustained disruption to our business or products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLikewise, data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including our intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information of our employees, patients or other business partners may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. There can be no assurance that our efforts, or the efforts of our partners and vendors, will prevent service interruptions, or identify breaches in our systems, that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us. In addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches.\nRisks Relating to Collaborators\nOur existing collaborations and any collaborations we enter into in the future may not be successful.\nWe rely in part on our collaborative alliances with AbbVie and BMS for the development of tilsotolimod. Our current collaboration agreements, as more fully described within Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or any collaborations we may enter into in the future, may not be successful. The success of our collaborative alliances, if any, will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Our existing collaborations and any potential future collaborations have risks, including the following: (i) our collaborators may control the development (and timing thereof) of the drug candidates being developed with our technologies and compounds and/or the companion diagnostic to be developed for use in conjunction with our drug candidates; (ii) our collaborators may control the public release of information regarding the developments; (iii) disputes may arise in the future with respect to the ownership of or right to use technology and intellectual property developed with our collaborators; (iv) disagreements with our collaborators could delay or terminate the development of our products, or result in litigation or arbitration; (v) we may have difficulty enforcing the contracts if any of our collaborators fail to perform; (vi) our collaborators may terminate their collaborations with us, which could make it difficult for us to attract new collaborators or adversely affect the perception of us in the business or financial communities; (vii) our collaboration agreements are likely to be for fixed terms and subject to termination by our collaborators in the event of a material breach or lack of scientific progress by us; (viii) our collaborators may challenge our intellectual property rights or utilize our intellectual property rights in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property rights or expose us to potential liability; (ix) our collaborators may not comply with all applicable regulatory requirements; (x) our collaborators may under fund or not commit sufficient resources to the testing or development of our drug candidates; and (xi) our collaborators may develop alternative products either on their own or in collaboration with others, or encounter conflicts of interest or changes in business strategy or other business issues. Given these risks, it is possible that any collaborative alliance into which we enter may not be successful.\nIf we are unable to establish additional collaborative alliances, our business may be materially harmed.\nCollaborators provide the necessary resources and drug development experience to advance our compounds in their programs. We have entered into and expect to continue to seek to enter into collaborative alliances with pharmaceutical companies to advance our TLR agonist and antagonist candidates and with respect to additional applications of our nucleic acid chemistry technology research program. Upfront payments and milestone payments received from collaborations help to provide us with the financial resources for our internal research and development programs. Our internal programs are focused on developing TLR-targeted drug candidates for the potential treatment of certain rare diseases and in our immuno-oncology program and on nucleic acid chemistry drug candidates. We believe that additional resources will be required to advance compounds in all of these areas. If we do not reach agreements with additional collaborators in the future or if the terms of such a collaborative alliance on are not favorable to us, we may not be able to obtain the expertise and resources necessary to achieve our business objectives, our ability to advance our compounds will be jeopardized and we may fail to meet our business objectives. Moreover, collaborations are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document, and implement. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations on a timely basis.\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our discoveries, the value of our technology and products will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to develop and commercialize drugs depends in significant part on our ability to: (i) obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents; (ii) obtain licenses to the proprietary rights of others on commercially reasonably terms; (iii) operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others; (iv) prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights; and (v) protect our trade secrets.\nWe do not know whether any of our currently pending patent applications or those patent applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and those that may be issued in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable, narrowed in the course of a post-issuance proceeding or circumvented, and the rights granted thereunder may not provide us proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Moreover, intellectual property laws may change and negatively impact our ability to obtain issued patents covering our technologies or to enforce any patents that issue. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing, and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thus reducing any advantage provided by the patent.\nBecause patent applications in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, neither we nor our licensors can be certain that we or they were the first to make the inventions claimed in issued patents or pending patent applications, or that we or they were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in these patent applications.\nThird parties may own or control patents or patent applications and require us to seek licenses, which could increase our development and commercialization costs, or prevent us from developing or marketing products.\nAlthough we have many issued patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and other countries, we may not have rights under certain third-party patents or patent applications related to our compounds under development. Third parties may own or control these patents and patent applications in the U.S. and abroad. In particular, we are aware of certain third-party U.S. patents that contain claims related to immunostimulatory polynucleotides and their use to stimulate an immune response, as well as to antisense technology. Although we do not believe any of our TLR or antisense compounds under development infringe any valid claim of these patents, we cannot be assured that the holder of such patents would not seek to assert such patents against us or, if the holder did, that the courts would not interpret the claims of such patents more broadly than we believe appropriate and determine that we are in infringement of such patents. In addition, there may be other patents and patent applications related to our current or future drug candidates of which we are not aware. Therefore, in some cases, in order to develop, manufacture, sell or import some of our drug candidates, we or our collaborators may choose to seek, or be required to seek, licenses under third-party patents issued in the U.S. and abroad or under third-party patents that might issue from U.S. and foreign patent applications. In such an event, we would be required to pay license fees or royalties or both\nto the licensor. If licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms, we or our collaborators may not be able to develop, manufacture, sell or import these products, or may be delayed in doing so. Either of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may become involved in expensive patent litigation or other proceedings, which could result in our incurring substantial costs and expenses or substantial liability for damages, require us to stop our development and commercialization efforts or result in our patents being invalidated, interpreted narrowly or limited.\nThere has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology industry. We may become a party to various types of patent litigation or other proceedings regarding intellectual property rights from time to time even under circumstances where we are not practicing and do not intend to practice any of the intellectual property involved in the proceedings. In addition to litigation, we may become involved in patent office proceedings, including oppositions, reexaminations, supplemental examinations and inter partes reviews involving our patents or the patents of third parties. We may initiate such proceedings or have such proceedings brought against us. An adverse determination in any such proceeding, or in litigation, could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future drug candidates. An adverse determination in a proceeding involving a patent in our portfolio could result in the loss of protection or a narrowing in the scope of protection provided by that patent.\nThe cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the cost of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. If any patent litigation or other proceeding is resolved against us, we or our collaborators may be enjoined from developing, manufacturing, selling or importing our drugs without a license from the other party and we may be held liable for significant damages. We may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially acceptable terms or at all. In a patent office proceeding, such as an opposition, reexamination or inter partes review, our patents may be narrowed or invalidated. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time.\nOur intellectual property may be infringed by a third party.\nThird parties may infringe one or more of our issued patents or trademarks. We cannot predict if, when or where a third party may infringe one or more of our issued patents or trademarks. To counter infringement, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, there is no assurance that we would be successful in proving that a third party is infringing one or more of our issued patents or trademarks. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could also provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us, alleging that we infringe their intellectual property. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly and/or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question, any of which may adversely affect our business. Even if we are successful in proving in a court of law that a third party is infringing one or more of our issued patents or trademarks there can be no assurance that we would be successful in halting their infringing activities.\nRisks Relating to Product Manufacturing, Marketing and Sales, and Reliance on Third Parties\nEven if tilsotolimod or other compounds we may develop are successful in clinical trials and receive regulatory approvals, we or our collaboration partners may not be able to successfully commercialize them.\nEven if tilsotolimod were successful in clinical development and receive regulatory approvals, it may never reach or remain on the market, be successfully developed into commercial products or gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors or the medical community for a number of reasons including: (i) it may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects; (ii) it may be difficult to manufacture on a scale necessary for commercialization; (iii) it may experience excessive product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, inadequate transportation or storage, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error,\nnatural disasters or other catastrophic events, inconsistency in yields or variability in product characteristics; (iv) it may be uneconomical to produce; (v) the timing of market introduction of tilsotolimod and other compounds we may develop and competitive products may be inopportune; (vi) political and legislative changes may make the commercialization of tilsotolimod, or any other product candidates we may develop in the future, more difficult; (vii) we may fail to obtain reimbursement approvals or pricing that is cost effective for patients as compared to other available forms of treatment or that covers the cost of production and other expenses; (viii) they may not compete effectively with existing or future alternatives; (ix) we may be unable to develop commercial operations and to sell marketing rights; (x) it may fail to achieve market acceptance; or (xi) we may be precluded from commercialization of a product due to proprietary rights of third parties.\nBecause we have limited manufacturing experience, and no manufacturing facilities or infrastructure, we are dependent on third-party manufacturers to manufacture drug candidates for us.\nWe have limited manufacturing experience and no manufacturing facilities, infrastructure or clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. In order to continue to develop our drug candidates, apply for regulatory approvals, and ultimately commercialize products, we need to develop, contract for or otherwise arrange for the necessary manufacturing capabilities. We currently rely upon third parties to produce material for nonclinical and clinical testing purposes and expect to continue to do so in the future. We also expect to rely upon third parties to produce materials that may be required for the commercial production of our drug candidates, if approved. Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our drug candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop drug candidates and commercialize any drug candidates on a timely and competitive basis. We currently do not have any long-term supply contracts.\nThere are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under the FDA's cGMP regulations capable of manufacturing our drug candidates. As a result, we may have difficulty finding manufacturers for our drug candidates suitable for our needs. If we are unable to arrange for third-party manufacturing of our drug candidates on a timely basis, or on acceptable terms, we may not be able to complete development of our drug candidates or market them.\nAny contract manufacturers with which we enter into manufacturing arrangements will be subject to ongoing periodic, unannounced inspections by the FDA, or foreign equivalent, and corresponding state and foreign agencies or their designees to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other governmental regulations and corresponding foreign standards. Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with such requirements, regulations or standards could lead to a delay in the conduct of our clinical trials, or a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates. Such failure could also result in sanctions being imposed, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, product seizures or recalls, imposition of operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, or criminal prosecution.\nAdditionally, contract manufacturers may not be able to manufacture our drug candidates at a cost or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable. Furthermore, changes in the manufacturing process or procedure, including a change in the location where the drug substance or drug product is manufactured or a change of a third-party manufacturer, may require prior FDA review and approval in accordance with the FDA's cGMP and NDA/BLA regulations. Contract manufacturers may also be subject to comparable foreign requirements. This review may be costly and time-consuming and could delay or prevent the launch of a drug candidate. The FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies at any time may also implement new standards, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards for manufacture, packaging or testing of products. If we or our contract manufacturers are unable to comply, we or they may be subject to regulatory action, civil actions or penalties.\nWe have no experience selling, marketing or distributing oncology products and no internal capability to do so.\nWe currently have no commercialization expertise in oncology, including sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. Advancing tilsotolimod through Phase 3 development and regulatory approval will require us to begin commercialization preparation activities and incur related expenses. These activities will include, among other things, the development of an in-house marketing organization and sales force, a market access and payor reimbursement strategy and a distribution function, which will require significant capital expenditures, management resources and time. If we are unable to adequately prepare the market for the potential future commercialization of tilsotolimod, we may not be able to generate product revenue once marketing authorization is obtained.\nIf we are unable or decide not to establish internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we will pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or if we are able to do so, that they will have effective sales forces. Any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful. We may have little or no control over the marketing and sales efforts of such third parties and our revenue from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized our product candidates ourselves. We also face competition in our search for third parties to assist us with the sales and marketing efforts of our product candidates.\nIf third parties on whom we rely for clinical trials do not perform as contractually required or as we expect, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our drug candidates and our business may suffer.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct the clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates. We depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations (CROs), and other third-party service providers in the conduct of the clinical trials of our drug candidates and expect to continue to do so. We expect to contract with CROs for future clinical trials. We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials, but do not control many aspects of their activities. We are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable regulations and protocols for the trial. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule, or at all, or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our protocols. If these third parties fail to carry out their obligations, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties. This could be difficult, costly or impossible, and our preclinical or clinical trials may need to be extended, delayed, terminated or repeated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval in a timely fashion, or at all, for the applicable drug candidate, or to commercialize such drug candidate being tested in such trials. If we seek to conduct any of these activities ourselves in the future, we will need to recruit appropriately trained personnel and add to our research, clinical, quality and corporate infrastructure.\nThe commercial success of any drug candidates that we may develop will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community.\nAny products that we ultimately bring to the market, if they receive marketing approval, may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors or others in the medical community. For example, current cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy are well-established in the medical community, and doctors may continue to rely on these treatments. If our products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate product revenue and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our products, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including: (i) the prevalence and severity of any side effects; (ii) the efficacy and potential advantages over alternative treatments; (iii) the ability to offer our drug candidates for sale at competitive prices; (iv) relative convenience and ease of administration; (v) the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies; (vi) the strength of marketing and distribution support and the timing of market introduction of competitive products; and (vii) publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments.\nEven if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile, market acceptance of the product will not be known until after it is launched. Our efforts to educate patients, the medical community, and third-party payors about our drug candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. Such efforts to educate the marketplace may require more resources than are required by conventional methods used by our competitors.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for any products that we may develop or acceptable prices for those products, our revenues and prospects for profitability will suffer.\nMost patients rely on Medicare, Medicaid, private health insurers, and other third-party payors to pay for their medical needs, including any drugs we may market. If third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage or reimbursement for any products that we may develop, our revenues and prospects for profitability will suffer.\nThird-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly-approved products. These third-party payors may base their coverage and reimbursement on the coverage and reimbursement rate paid by carriers for Medicare beneficiaries. Furthermore, many such payors are investigating or implementing methods for reducing health care costs, such as the establishment of capitated or prospective payment systems. Cost containment pressures have led to an increased emphasis on the use of cost-effective products by health care providers, which could limit the price we might\nestablish for products that we or our current or future collaborators may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us. In particular, third-party payors may limit the indications for which they will reimburse patients who use any products that we may develop.\nWe face a risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain insurance.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that is inherent in the manufacturing, testing, and marketing of prescription drugs. We face a risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our drug candidates in clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims and product recalls may result in: (i) decreased demand for our drug candidates and products; (ii) damage to our reputation; (iii) regulatory investigations that could require costly recalls or product modifications; (iv) withdrawal of clinical trial participants; (v) costs to defend related ligation; (vi) substantial monetary awards to clinical trial participants or patients; (vii) loss of revenue; (viii) the diversion of management's attention away from managing our business; and (ix) the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nAlthough we have product liability and clinical trial liability insurance that we believe is adequate, this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. We may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate protection against potential liabilities. If we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we will be exposed to significant liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial position. These liabilities could also prevent or interfere with our commercialization efforts.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law, may prevent a change in control that stockholders may consider desirable.\nSection 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company or discourage a third party from attempting to take over our company. These provisions include: (i) a classified board of directors; (ii) limitations on the removal of directors; (iii) limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders; (iv) the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings; and (v) the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval. These provisions could: (i) have the effect of delay, defer or prevent a change in control of us or a change in our management that stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial or (ii) discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions.\nThe Company\u2019s amended and restated bylaws (\u201cBylaws\u201d) provide, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain legal actions between the Company and its stockholders, which could increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit the ability of the Company\u2019s stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum viewed by the stockholders as more favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company\u2019s directors, officers or other employees.\nOur Bylaws provide to the fullest extent permitted by law that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, other employee or stockholder of the Company to the Company or its stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, (v) or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company or its directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Company\u2019s amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. The exclusive forum provision in our Bylaws would not apply to claims brought under the Securities Exchange Act or the Securities Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Additionally, such provision will not relieve us of our duty to comply with the federal securities laws and\nthe rules and regulations thereunder, and stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.\nApproximately 35% of our outstanding common stock is held (36% beneficially owned) by three stockholders. If these significant stockholders choose to act together, they could exert substantial influence over our business, and the interests of these stockholders may conflict with those of other stockholders.\nThere is a concentration of ownership of our outstanding common stock because approximately 35% of our outstanding common stock is owned by three stockholders. As of February 15, 2021: (i) Baker Bros. Advisors LP, and certain of its affiliated funds (collectively, \u201cBaker Brothers\u201d) beneficially owned 11.1% of our outstanding common stock, which excludes all convertible securities as a result of certain beneficial ownership limitations as discussed on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K; (ii) entities affiliated with Pillar Invest Corporation (the \u201cPillar Investment Entities\u201d) beneficially owned 19.9% of our outstanding common stock; and (iii) Castellina Ventures Ltd. (\u201cCastellina\u201d and, together with Baker Brothers and Pillar Investment Entities, the \u201cSignificant Securityholders\u201d) beneficially owned 5.3% of our outstanding common stock. If any of our Significant Securityholders acted together, they could be able to exert substantial influence over our business. Additionally, the interests of the Significant Securityholders may be different from or conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. This concentration of voting power with the Significant Securityholders could delay, defer or prevent a change of control, entrench our management and the board of directors or delay or prevent a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us on terms that other stockholders may desire. In addition, conflicts of interest could arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and either of our Significant Securityholders on the other hand, concerning potential competitive business activities, business opportunities, the issuance of additional securities and other matters.\nOur financial statements, including our balance sheets and statements of operations, are subject to quarterly changes related to the revaluation our warrant and future tranche right liabilities.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 480, Liabilities-Distinguishing from Equity and/or ASC Topic 815, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, our outstanding Series B1 convertible preferred shares are accounted for as temporary equity and related warrants and future tranche rights issued in connection with our December 2019 Private Placement are accounted for as liabilities at fair value. Accordingly, the associated warrant and future tranche right liabilities are re-measured at each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. The process of determining the fair value of the warrants and future tranche rights requires complex models and the development of significant and subjective estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors. As a result, our financial statements and results of operations may fluctuate quarterly, based on factors, such as the trading value of our common stock and certain assumptions, which are outside of our control. The liabilities and accounting line items associated with our warrant and future tranche right liabilities on our balance sheet and statement of operations are non-cash items, and the inclusion of such items in our financial statements may materially affect the outcome of our quarterly and annual results, even though such items are non-cash and do not affect the cash we have available for operations. Investors should take such accounting matters and other non-cash items into account when comparing our quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year operating results and financial statements.\nIf we are required to redeem shares of Series B1 preferred stock, or, if issued, Series B2, Series B3 or Series B4 preferred stock, our cash position will be negatively impacted.\nPursuant to the December 2019 Securities Purchase Agreement, we issued 23,684 shares of Series B1 preferred stock and are contingently obligated to issue 98,685 shares of Series B2 preferred stock, 82,418 shares of Series B3 preferred stock and 82,418 shares of Series B4 preferred stock and accompanying warrants exercisable for either common stock or Series B1 preferred stock, to the extent Baker Brothers exercise its option to purchase these securities. Subject to the terms of the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of Series B1 Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B2 Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B3 Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B4 Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company, on or after the five-year anniversary of the applicable initial issuance date of each such series of preferred stock, and to the extent that the holder\u2019s redemption rights with regard to such series of preferred stock are not lost upon our achievement of certain criteria regarding our stock price and ILLUMINATE-301 on or before the two-year anniversary date of the applicable initial issuance date, some or all of our outstanding shares of such series of preferred stock may be redeemable at the option of the holder at a redemption price of $152.00 per share of Series B1 and Series B2 preferred stock and $182.00 per share of Series B3 and Series B4 preferred stock. If a holder of preferred stock requests redemption, we will be required to redeem such\nshares of preferred stock, subject to certain provisions regarding insufficient funds. We may be unable to redeem such preferred stock if restrictions under applicable law or contractual obligations prohibit such redemption. Unless we operate profitably, our ability to redeem the preferred stock would require the availability of adequate \u201csurplus,\u201d which is defined as the excess, if any, of our net assets (total assets less total liabilities) over our capital. To date, we have operated at a loss. To the extent a Series B preferred stockholder exercises its redemption rights when it is eligible to do so, and if we do not have sufficient \u201csurplus\u201d under Delaware law at that time, we would be unable to effect such redemption. If we do have sufficient \u201csurplus\u201d to effect such redemption at that time, our available cash will be negatively impacted and our ability to use the net proceeds from this offering could be substantially limited. In addition, such reduction in our available cash could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nThe issuance or sale of shares of our common stock, including the issuance of our securities pursuant to the December 2019 Securities Purchase Agreement, could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nThe December 2019 Securities Purchase Agreement transaction consists of four separate tranches. The terms of the tranches, including the number of shares issued or to be issued, the purchase prices, and the conversion prices and the number of warrants and exercise prices, are set forth beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If (i) we issue shares of common stock pursuant to the conversion or exercise of the securities issuable under the December 2019 Securities Purchase Agreement, (ii) we issue additional shares of our common stock or rights to acquire shares of our common stock in other future transactions, (iii) any of our existing stockholders sells a substantial amount of our common stock, or (iv) the market perceives that such issuances or sales may occur, then the trading price of our common stock may significantly decrease. In addition, our issuance of additional shares of common stock will dilute the ownership interests of our existing common stockholders.\nCertain investors in the December 2019 private placement will have the ability to control or significantly influence certain business decisions.\nPursuant to the terms of the December 2019 Securities Purchase Agreement, subject to certain conditions, Baker Brothers have consent rights over certain significant matters of the Company\u2019s business. These include decisions to (i) issue or authorize equity securities that rank equal or senior to the Series B1, Series B2, Series B3 and Series B4 preferred stock with respect to liquidation preference, (ii) incur any indebtedness in excess of $1,000,000, in the aggregate, outside the ordinary course of business (other than the refinancing of the Company\u2019s term debt, if any), (iii) sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of tilsotolimod (such approval not to be reasonably withheld), (iv) license tilsotolimod in the U.S. or the E.U. (in each case such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), or (v) pay any dividends. As a result, Baker Brothers will have significant influence over certain matters affecting our business.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, investor returns will be limited to any increase in the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to support our operations and finance the growth and development of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Additionally, the December 2019 Securities Purchase Agreement, more fully described below, contains negative covenants which restricts our ability to pay dividends on our equity securities. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock, if any.", "PERMNO": 82824, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "IDRA"}
