{"cik": "6176", "company": "AMPCO PITTSBURGH CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nFrom time to time, important factors may cause actual results to differ materially from future expected results based on performance expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements made by us, including known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are not possible to predict or control. Several of these factors are described from time to time in our filings with the SEC, but the factors described in filings are not the only risks that the Corporation faces.\nCyclical demand for products and economic downturns could reduce the demand for, and sales of, our products, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability.\nA significant portion of the Forged and Cast Engineered Products segment\u2019s sales consists of mill rolls to customers in the global steel and aluminum industry that can be periodically impacted by economic or cyclical downturns. Such downturns, the timing and length of which are difficult to predict, may reduce the demand for, and sales of, our forged and cast rolls both in the United States and the rest of the world. Lower demand for rolls may also adversely impact profitability as other competing roll producers lower selling prices in the marketplace in order to fill their manufacturing capacity. Cancellation of orders or deferral of delivery of rolls may occur and produce an adverse impact on financial results. In addition, sales of non-roll product, consisting of open-die forged product primarily for the oil and gas industry, are impacted by fluctuations in global energy prices.\nExcess global capacity in steel industry could lower prices for our products, which could adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability, as well as collectability of receivables and salability of in-process inventory.\nThe global steel manufacturing capacity continues to exceed global consumption of steel products. Such excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices significantly below their home market prices (often due to local government assistance or subsidies), which leads to global market destabilization and reduced sales and profitability of some of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 customers, which, in turn, affects our sales and profit margins, as well as collectability of receivables and salability of in-process inventory.\nA reduction in the level of export sales, as well as other economic factors in foreign countries, could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nExports are a significant proportion of our subsidiaries\u2019 sales. Historically, changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly in respect of the U.S. dollar, British pound, Swedish krona and the euro, have impacted the export of our products and may do so again in the future. Other factors that may adversely impact export sales and operating results include political and economic instability, export controls, changes in tax laws and tariffs, and new indigenous producers in overseas markets. A reduction in the level of export sales may have an adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates may provide foreign roll suppliers with advantages based on those lower foreign currency exchange rates and, therefore, permit them to compete in our home markets.\nFluctuation of the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our subsidiaries operate in foreign jurisdictions and, accordingly, earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Since our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, and assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies will affect the translated value for revenue, expenses and balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies and could materially affect our financial results expressed in U.S. dollars.\nCommodity price increases, as well as any reductions in electricity, gas supply or shortage of key production materials, could adversely impact our production, which could result in lower profitability or higher losses.\nOur subsidiaries use certain commodities in the manufacture of their products. These include steel scrap, ferroalloys, energy and graphite electrodes. Any unexpected, sudden or prolonged price increase may cause a reduction in profit margins or losses where fixed-priced contracts have been accepted or increases cannot be obtained in future selling prices. In addition, there may be curtailment in electricity or gas supply which could adversely impact production. Shortage of critical materials, while driving up costs, may be of such severity as to disrupt production, all of which may impact sales and profitability. The global supply shortage of graphite electrodes used for electric arc furnace melting of our steels could materially impact results of operations should we be unable to secure sufficient supply for our production requirements.\nA work stoppage or another industrial action on the part of any of our unions could be disruptive to our operations.\nOur subsidiaries have several key operations which are subject to multi-year collective bargaining agreements with their hourly work forces. While we believe we have good relations with our unions, there is the risk of industrial action or work stoppage at the expiration of an agreement if contract negotiations break down, which may disrupt manufacturing and impact results of operations.\nDependence on certain equipment may cause an interruption in our production if such equipment is out of operation for an extended period of time, which could result in lower sales and profitability.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 principal business relies on certain unique equipment such as an electric arc furnace and a spin cast work roll machine. Although a comprehensive critical spare inventory of key components for this equipment is maintained, if any such unique equipment is out of operation for an extended period, it may result in a significant reduction in our sales and earnings.\nThe ultimate liability of our subsidiaries for claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos-containing components historically used in certain products of our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity in the future.\nOur subsidiaries, and in some cases, we, are defendants in numerous claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos-containing components historically used in certain products of our subsidiaries. Through the current year end, our insurance has covered a substantial majority of our settlement and defense costs. We believe that the estimated costs net of anticipated insurance recoveries of our pending and future asbestos legal proceedings should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. However, there can be no assurance that our subsidiaries or we will not be subject to significant additional claims in the future or that our subsidiaries\u2019 ultimate liability with respect to asbestos claims will not present significantly greater and longer lasting financial exposure than provided in our financial statements. The ultimate net liability with respect to such pending and any unasserted claims is subject to various uncertainties, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe number of claims in the future;\n\u2022\nthe costs of defending and settling these claims;\n\u2022\ninsolvencies among our insurance carriers and the risk of future insolvencies;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that adverse jury verdicts could require damage payments in amounts greater than the amounts for which we have historically settled claims;\n\u2022\npossible changes in the litigation environment or federal and state law governing the compensation of asbestos claimants; and\n\u2022\nthe risk that the bankruptcies of other asbestos defendants may increase our costs.\nBecause of the uncertainties related to such claims, it is possible that the ultimate liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity in the future.\nPotential attacks on information technology infrastructure and other cyber-based business disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on integrated information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems to conduct our business. IT systems failures, including risks associated with upgrading our systems or in successfully integrating IT and other systems to common platforms, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions, our ability to protect customer or company information and our financial reporting. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, could be damaged or interrupted by power outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer viruses; internal or external security breaches; events such as fires, earthquakes, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes; and/or errors by our employees. Cyber-based risks, in particular, are evolving and include potential attacks to our IT infrastructure and to the IT infrastructure of third parties in attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information or information relating to our employees, customers and other third parties or to seek ransom. Although we have taken steps to address these concerns, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nA change in the existing regulatory environment could negatively affect our operations and financial performance.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws, rules and regulations. We are affected by new laws and regulations, and changes to existing laws and regulations, including interpretations by courts and regulators. These laws, regulations and policies, and changes thereto, may result in restrictions or limitations to our current operational practices and processes and product/service offerings which could negatively impact our current cost structure, revenue streams, cash flows, and overall financial position.\nIn 2018, the United States imposed tariffs of 25% on primary steel imports and 10% on primary aluminum imports into the United States. As consumers of steel and aluminum in some of our products, our cost base is exposed to the impact of this action, or similar actions, on our margins, and we could potentially lose market share to foreign competitors not subject to similar tariffs increases. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may continue to be affected by these tariffs, or similar actions. Moreover, these new tariffs, or other changes in U.S. trade policy, have resulted in, and may continue to trigger, retaliatory actions by affected countries which could adversely impact demand for our products, as well as impact our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, may adversely impact our business.\nNew trade restrictions and regulatory burdens associated with \u201cBrexit\u201d could adversely impact our operations and financial performance.\nOn June 23, 2016, voters in the United Kingdom (the \u201cU.K.\u201d) approved a referendum to exit from the European Union (the \u201cE.U.\u201d), commonly known as \u201cBrexit.\u201d The U.K left the E.U. on January 31, 2020. The E.U. and the U.K. agreed upon the terms of an agreement which sets out the terms of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U. and includes a transitional period until December 31, 2020. The U.K. has not entered into trade agreements with several of its primary trading partners, including the E.U. If a trade agreement between the E.U. and the U.K. is not reached before December 31, 2020, then trade between the E.U. and U.K. may be subject to tariffs and other restrictions. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications of the U.K. leaving the E.U. with no trade agreements in place would have and how such withdrawal would affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to achieve expected benefits of restructuring our operations or consummating future divestitures of operations which become non-core to our portfolio.\nWe may, from time to time, divest businesses that become less of a strategic fit within our core portfolio or restructure operations to improve operating results. Our profitability may be impacted by gains or losses on the sale or restructuring of such businesses and our level of expected cost savings from restructuring actions may not materialize. Additionally, we may be required to record asset impairment or restructuring charges related to these businesses and may in the future become responsible for liabilities which materialize post-divestiture. These issues may adversely impact our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may not continue to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange, which imposes both objective and subjective requirements for continued listing. Continued listing criteria include our financial condition, market capitalization and shareholders\u2019 equity. Specifically, the New York Stock Exchange requires a company listed on its exchange to maintain average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period of at least $50 million or maintain shareholders\u2019 equity of at least $50 million. Our common stock\u2019s average-global market capitalization over the 30 trading-day period ended December 31, 2019, was less than $50 million and our shareholders\u2019 equity was $55.6 million as of December 31, 2019. Should we receive a notice of non-compliance, the New York Stock Exchange may allow up to an 18-month cure period if we present a plan to become compliant, with adequate strategic actions and progress reporting satisfactory to the New York Stock Exchange. If the New York Stock Exchange determines that our common stock fails to satisfy the requirements for continued listing or we continue to fail to meet listing criteria, our common stock could be de-listed from the New York Stock Exchange, which could impact potential liquidity for our shareholders.\nWe face limitations in availability of capital to fund our strategic plans. Additionally, deterioration in our credit profile or increases in interest rates could increase our costs of borrowing and further limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit.\nWe are parties to a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility collateralized by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of our assets. The Credit Agreement provides for initial borrowings not to exceed $100 million, with an option to increase the credit facility by an additional $50 million at our request and with the approval of the banks, but restricts us from incurring additional indebtedness outside of the Credit Agreement, unless otherwise approved by the banks. The Credit Agreement is subject to various affirmative and negative covenants and contains various sub-limits, including those based on type of collateral and borrowings by geographic region. If the financial covenants become difficult to meet or if our borrowing needs increase beyond the prescribed limits, our results of operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected. In addition, our access to public debt markets is limited based on our size, credit profile and not being a well-known seasoned issuer. Further, changes in our credit profile could cause less favorable commercial terms for the procurement of materials required to manufacture our products, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity.\nWe have significant international operations and sales, and face risks related to health epidemics such as the coronavirus.\nOutbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the recent outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, has resulted in significant local governmental measures being\nimplemented to control the spread of the virus, including restrictions on manufacturing and the movement of employees in many regions of the country. The extent to which the coronavirus will impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. In addition, the coronavirus may result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn, and also adversely impacting our sales and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 18075, "SIC": 3460, "TIC": "AP"}
