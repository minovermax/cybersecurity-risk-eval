{"cik": "724571", "company": "FREDS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-05-03", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestors are encouraged to carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this document when considering an investment decision with respect to Fred's securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to management, or that management currently deems immaterial, may also impair the Company\u2019s business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In that instance, the trading price of Fred's securities could decline and investors might lose all or part of their investment.\nCompetitive and Strategic Risks\nOur financial performance has raised substantial doubt about our ability to remain a going concern.\nThe financial statements included in this report have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has experienced significant net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities in recent years, and we cannot assure you that such losses and negative cash flows will not continue for the foreseeable future. For the fiscal years ended February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018, we incurred net losses of $137.2 million and $144.5 million, respectively, and our net cash flows used in operating activities were $91.5 million and $44.7 million, respectively. Furthermore, the Company has limited availability under its Revolving Credit Agreement, which along with cash from operations has traditionally been the Company\u2019s primary source of working capital. As of April 30, 2019, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $78.3 million under our Revolving Credit Agreement and excess availability of $37.1 million. Under our Revolving Credit Agreement, we have a financial covenant to maintain at all times excess availability of at least the greater of $21,000,000 and 10% of the commitments, and if excess availability falls below such threshold, it would constitute an event of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Company\u2019s failure to comply with the financial covenants and other obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement would result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness and other remedies. Furthermore, as described above under Item 1: Business - Recent Developments - Recent Developments Affecting the Revolving Credit Agreement, the failure to deliver audited financial statements without a going concern qualification within 120 days of fiscal year end will result in the Going Concern Event of Default, and there are certain other events of default that may be outstanding under our Revolving Credit Agreement.\nAn event of default, which is not cured or waived, would permit, among other remedies, acceleration of Fred\u2019s indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Agreement and the addition, at the option of the Required Lenders (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement), of 200 basis points to the applicable interest rate with respect to all loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement (the \u201cDefault Rate\u201d). As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement have not taken any action to accelerate our indebtedness, impose the Default Rate or exercise other remedies with respect to the Revolver EODs, but there can be no assurance that such lenders will not do so in the future. Fred\u2019s is currently seeking an agreement with its lenders pursuant to which such lenders would forbear for a period of time from seeking remedies on account of, or waive, the Revolver EODs, but there is no assurance that Fred\u2019s will receive such forbearance or waivers. If our indebtedness is accelerated, whether due to the Revolver EODs or otherwise, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all.\nIf our indebtedness is accelerated, the Company cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition and could impact our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, our Revolving Credit Agreement has a maturity date of April 9, 2020, and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to renew or refinance such facility on terms acceptable to us or at all. The foregoing conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company has evaluated its plans to alleviate this doubt, including evaluating strategic alternatives, assessing alternative financing arrangements, and undertaking certain operational measures, such as store closures, renegotiated lease terms and reductions in general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures. The Company can provide no assurance, however, regarding the outcome of its evaluation of strategic alternatives, that alternative financing will be on terms acceptable to us or at all, or that the operational measures being undertaken by the Company will be successful in improving the Company\u2019s financial performance, in which case the Company may be unable to continue as a going concern. The financial statements included in this report do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. See Item 7: \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWe are exploring strategic alternatives and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any strategic alternative or that any such strategic alternative will yield additional value for shareholders.\n- 14 -\nWe have commenced a review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, which could result in, among other things, a sale, a merger, a consolidation or business combination, further store closures or other asset divestitures, financing transactions, or restructurings. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction. In addition, we may incur substantial expenses associated with identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives. The process of exploring strategic alternatives may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations and if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also cannot assure that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to our shareholders than that reflected in the current stock price. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in our business and the availability of financing on reasonable terms.\nWe operate in a competitive industry.\nThe discount retail and retail pharmacy industries in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete with respect to price, store location, in-stock consistency, merchandise quality, assortment and presentation and customer service with many national, regional and local retailing establishments, including drug stores, independent pharmacies, department stores, discount stores, variety stores, dollar stores, discount clothing stores, grocery stores, outlet stores, convenience stores, warehouse stores and other stores. Our competitors range from smaller, growing companies to considerably larger retail businesses that have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do. Furthermore, the retail sector continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications, and some online-only businesses have lower operating costs. Online and multi-channel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, with customers increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-price or free shipping. We compete with many of these e-commerce and mail order businesses, a space in which we do not have a presence. This competitive environment subjects us to various risks, including the ability to continue to provide competitively priced products to our customers that will allow us to achieve and maintain profitability. Some of our competitors utilize aggressive promotional activities, advertising programs and pricing discounts and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not respond effectively to these efforts. If we fail to successfully compete, our profitability and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur turnaround plans depend significantly on strategies and initiatives designed to improve long-term growth, profitability and shareholder value. Failure to achieve or sustain these plans could affect the Company\u2019s performance adversely.\nThroughout 2018, we sought to execute our turnaround strategy through the following strategic initiatives: monetizing non-core assets; reducing selling, general and administrative expenses; bringing new talent into the organization; driving traffic; improving assortment and optimizing inventory levels; generating free cash flow; and reducing debt levels. The successful design and implementation of these initiatives present significant challenges, many of which are beyond our control. We were not successful in executing all of our strategic initiatives in 2018, and we may not be successful in doing so in 2019. In addition, these initiatives may not advance our business strategy as expected. Events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. If we are unable to realize the anticipated financial benefits of these initiatives, our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected. Any failure to implement these initiatives in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the complexity of these initiatives has and will continue to require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. Our management team must successfully implement administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of these initiatives. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization's attention from existing core businesses, integrating financial or other systems, have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows may be adversely affected.\nFurther, the success of our merchandising initiatives, particularly those with respect to non-consumable merchandise such as pharmaceutical products, as well as store-specific allocations such as those made to Xpress stores, depends in part upon our ability to predict consistently and successfully the products that our customers will demand and to identify and timely respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences, expectations and needs. If we are unable to select products that are attractive to customers in amounts that customers are likely to buy, to timely obtain such products at costs that allow us to sell them at an acceptable profit, or to effectively market such products, then our sales, market share and profitability could be adversely affected. Further, if our merchandising efforts in the areas of general pharmaceutical products and higher margin consumables are unsuccessful, it could be further adversely affected by our inability to offset the lower margins associated with the Company\u2019s other lines of business.\n- 15 -\nDivestiture of our specialty pharmacy businesses, all or part of our retail pharmacy business, or any other business line, including those that we have acquired or will acquire, may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, or may result in impairment charges that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nDivestitures involve risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business, the loss of customers and customer-loyalty, the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain contingent liabilities related to the divested business, any of which could result in a material adverse effect to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Divestitures of previously acquired businesses may result in significant asset impairment charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Future impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of the acquired business or product line, adverse market conditions and changes in the competitive landscape, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of the acquired business or product line, changes in accounting rules and regulations and a variety of other circumstances. The amount of any impairment is recorded as a charge to the statement of operations. We may never realize the full value of our goodwill and intangible assets, and any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of these assets may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of the sale of assets to Advance Care Scripts/CVS and Walgreen Co., which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe have sold certain prescription files and records, pharmaceutical inventory, and certain other assets used in our specialty and retail pharmacy businesses with the expectation that the transactions will result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. We can provide no assurance that:\n\u2022\nthe anticipated benefits of the transactions, including cost savings, will be fully realized in the time frame anticipated or at all;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs, charges and expenses will not result from the transactions;\n\u2022\nlitigation relating to the transactions will not be filed; and\n\u2022\nthe transaction will not cause disruption to the parties\u2019 business and operations and relationships with employees and suppliers, payers, customers and other third parties.\nIf one or more of these risks are realized, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe could also encounter unforeseen transaction costs or other circumstances, such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues resulting from the transactions. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue and the diversion of management time and attention, which could adversely impact our agility to respond to market opportunities and our ability to timely identify and implement other strategic actions. If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we have incurred significant transaction costs related to the transactions. These costs, including legal, accounting, financial and tax advisory and other fees and costs, may be higher than expected and some of these costs may be material.\nOur ability to achieve the results of store closures under our strategic plan initiatives could adversely affect our business.\nAs part of our continuing operations, we perform research and analysis to identify underperforming stores and to determine if store closure is necessary. For example, in April 2019, the Company announced a plan to close 159 underperforming stores. The decision to close these stores was the result of a comprehensive evaluation of the Company\u2019s store portfolio, which examined historical and recent store performance and the timing of lease expirations, among other factors. These store closings, and any other store closures that the Company may pursue, may cause us to expend significant capital and other resources, write-off assets, accelerate rent expenses, incur impairment charges, adversely affect our credit, terms and relationships with vendors and suppliers, adversely affect our distribution and cost structure, and may subject to us to litigation. On April 11, 2019, we announced on a Current Report on Form 8-K that material charges for impairment and other costs would be required in connection with the plan to close 159 performance stores and that we will file an amendment to such Current Report on Form 8-K after we determine an estimate or range of estimates for such impairment charges and other costs. Our reputation and brand may be damaged in connection with the store closings. Customers that shopped in our stores may not purchase the same number (or any) of our products after our stores are closed. While we are attempting to negotiate favorable lease terms with our landlords, we may be unsuccessful in doing so and may incur significant lease termination charges. Any of these results could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. There can be no assurance\n- 16 -\nthat the store closings, or any future store closings, will improve our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The estimated costs and charges associated with these and any future store closures may vary materially and adversely based upon various factors, including the timing of execution, the outcome of negotiations with landlords and other third parties, or unexpected costs, any of which could result in our not realizing the anticipated benefits from the strategic plan.\nUnderperforming stores can result in charges and expenses.\nIf individual stores underperform to the point that their future estimated cash flows will not cover our un-depreciated fixed asset investment, we take an impairment charge. We also close certain underperforming stores, generally based on the lack of store profitability. Such closures subject us to costs, including lease termination payments and the write-down of leasehold improvements, equipment, furniture, fixtures and inventory. For early terminations, we may incur charges for asset write-downs and remain liable for future lease obligations, which could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.\nWe depend on successfully increasing the utilization of our existing stores and, in the longer-term, opening new stores, for a portion of our growth.\nOur growth is dependent on both increases in sales in existing stores and, in the longer-term, the ability to open new stores. Unavailability of store locations that we deem desirable, delays in the opening of new stores, difficulties in staffing and operating new store locations and the lack of customer acceptance of stores in expanded market areas all may negatively impact our new store growth, the costs associated with new stores and/or the profitability of new stores. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to re-negotiate leases at similar or satisfactory terms at the end of the lease, and we could be forced to move or exit locations if another favorable arrangement cannot be made. There is also no assurance that we will be able to negotiate satisfactory terms on new or replacement stores, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. Our ability to renew or enter into new leases on favorable terms could affect costs of operations or slow store expansions.\nOur private brand offerings expose us to various additional risks.\nIn addition to brand name products, we offer our customers private brand products that are not available from other retailers. We seek to continue to grow our exclusive private brand offerings as part of our growth strategy, including through the expanded offerings of brands we own or license on an exclusive basis, as well as through selective acquisitions. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing and availability of our private brand offerings for our customers, as well as the timely development and introduction of new products, is important in differentiating us from other retailers and developing and maintaining customer loyalty. Although we believe that our private brand products offer value to our customers and typically provide us with higher gross margins than comparable national brand products we sell, the expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to additional risks, such as potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls; our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties; our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and regulatory requirements; and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail. An increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors\u2019 products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors. Any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business operations, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur revenues, profitability and results of operations are subject to conditions affecting the retail sector as a whole.\nOur business is influenced by the factors that affect the retail sector as a whole, which may be negatively impacted by increased unemployment, changes in international, national, regional, and local economic conditions, increased federal income and payroll taxes, increased health care costs, increased state and local taxes, increased real estate taxes, industry slowdowns, lack of availability of consumer credit, weak income growth, increased levels of consumer debt, poor housing market conditions, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, plant closings, and other factors. If the retail sector is negatively affected by any of these risks, our business operations, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\n- 17 -\nUse of a single supplier of pharmaceutical products and our ability to negotiate satisfactory terms could adversely affect our business.\nWe have a long-term supply contract from a single supplier, Cardinal Health, for our pharmaceutical operations. Any significant disruption in our relationship with this supplier, deterioration in their financial condition, changes in terms, supplier increases in pharmaceutical costs or an industry-wide change in wholesale business practices, including those of our supplier or the manufacturers with whom our supplier transacts business, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs.\nNew brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales, while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales, but relatively higher gross profit margins. Accordingly, a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced, or delays in their introduction, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs, including generic drugs, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases. Any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections.\nWe derive a significant portion of our sales from prescription drug sales reimbursed by pharmacy benefit management companies.\nWe derive a significant portion of our sales from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by pharmacy benefit management (\u201cPBM\u201d) companies. PBM companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates, and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. There can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular PBM company\u2019s pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period. If our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large PBM companies is restricted or terminated, we expect that our sales would be adversely affected, at least in the short-term. If we are unable to replace any such lost sales, either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. If we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation, there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace, or that all clients of the PBM company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans, initially or at all. In addition, in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in industry pricing benchmarks and drug pricing generally.\nIt is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace Average Wholesale Price (\u201cAWP\u201d) or Wholesale Acquisition Cost (\u201cWAC\u201d), which are the pricing references used for many of our PBM contracts, pharmaceutical purchase agreements, retail network contracts, specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payments. In addition, many state Medicaid fee-for-service programs (\u201cFFS Medicaid\u201d) may be required to establish pharmacy network payments on the basis of Actual Acquisition Cost (\u201cAAC\u201d). This move to an AAC basis in FFS Medicaid could have an impact in reimbursement practices in other commercial and government segments. Future changes to the use of AWP, WAC or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health programs and/or other payors, could impact the reimbursement we receive from Medicare and Medicaid programs, the reimbursement we receive from PBM clients and other payors and/or our ability to negotiate rebates and/or discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, PBMs and retail pharmacies. A failure or inability to fully offset any increased prices or costs or to modify our operations to mitigate the impact of such increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections. Changes to pharmacy benefit manager Direct and Indirect Remuneration Fees could adversely affect future performance. The effect of these possible changes on our business cannot be predicted at this time.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany organizations in the healthcare industry, including PBMs, have consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power, which has resulted in greater pricing pressures. If this consolidation trend continues, it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services. If these pressures result in reductions in our prices, our business will become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs or develop profitable new revenue streams. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies,\n- 18 -\ngovernment contracting requirements, and societal pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve, potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among the industry participants we engage with, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe availability of pharmacy drugs is subject to governmental regulations.\nThe continued conversion of various prescription drugs, including potential conversions of a number of popular medications, to over-the-counter medications may reduce our pharmacy sales and customers may seek to purchase such medications at non-pharmacy stores. Also, if the rate at which new prescription drugs become available slows or if new prescription drugs that are introduced into the market fail to achieve popularity, our pharmacy sales may be adversely affected. The withdrawal of certain drugs from the market or concerns about the safety or effectiveness of certain drugs or negative publicity surrounding certain categories of drugs may also have a negative effect on our pharmacy sales or may cause shifts in our pharmacy or front-end product mix.\nOperational Risks\nOur business is somewhat seasonal.\nWe typically realize a slightly larger portion of our net sales during the holiday selling season in the first and fourth fiscal quarters in addition to the heavier sales volume we experience around the first day of each calendar month. Our inventories and short-term borrowings, if required, increase in anticipation of this holiday season. A seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could occur if, for any reason, our net sales during the holiday selling season were to fall below seasonal norms. If for any reason our first and fourth quarter results were substantially below expectations, our profitability and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns, especially in seasonal merchandise.\nNatural disasters, unusually adverse weather conditions or other extraordinary events could affect our business.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes and earthquakes, unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, such as civil unrest in countries in which our suppliers are located, or similar disruptions could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Unseasonal or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns or prevent customers from reaching our stores, which could lead to lost sales. These events could result in increases in fuel or other energy prices, a fuel shortage, store opening delays, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption of product availability in our stores, and disruption of our utility services or information systems. These events may also increase the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage. In addition, these disruptions could also adversely affect our supply chain efficiency and make it more difficult for us to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise from suppliers. A number of our stores are located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes, tornadoes and other adverse weather conditions.\nOperational difficulties could disrupt our business.\nOur stores are managed through a network of geographically dispersed management personnel. Our inability to effectively and efficiently operate our stores, including the ability to control losses resulting from inventory shrinkage, may negatively impact our sales and/or margin. In addition, we rely upon our distribution and logistics network to provide goods to stores in a timely and cost-effective manner; any disruption, unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process such as a decrease in the capacity of carriers and strikes could negatively impact the timely receipt of merchandise and increase transportation costs disrupting our store operations. Our operation depends on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of its business. We rely on certain software vendors to maintain and upgrade these systems as needed. We rely on telecommunications carriers to gather and disseminate our operational information. The disruption or failure of these systems or carriers could negatively impact our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur revenues, profitability and results of operations could be adversely affected by additional risks in our supply chain.\nOptimal product flow is dependent on demand planning and forecasting, production to plan by suppliers, and timely transportation. We often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors in advance of proposed production dates. Significant deviation from the projected demand for products that we sell may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, either from lost sales or lower margins due to the need to reduce prices to dispose of excess inventory. Disruptions to our supply chain could result in late arrivals of product. This could negatively affect sales due to increased levels of out-of-stock merchandise and loss of confidence by customers in our ability to deliver goods as promised. During 2018, we experienced increased levels of out-of-stock merchandise, which adversely affected our financial performance, and we can provide no assurance that such out-of-stock issues will not adversely affect us in the future.\n- 19 -\nMerchandise supply and pricing and the interruption of and dependence on imports could adversely affect our business.\nWe purchase a portion of our inventory from foreign suppliers, principally in China. As a result, political or financial instability, terrorism, tariffs, disruptions, strikes or other events resulting in the disruption of trade from other countries or the imposition of additional regulations relating to duties on imports could cause significant delays or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase our costs. Also, our cost of goods is affected by the fluctuation of local currencies against the dollar in countries where these goods are produced. Accordingly, changes in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our cost of goods sold and, if we are unable to pass such cost increases on to our customers, decrease our gross margins and ultimately our earnings. In addition, our ability to obtain merchandise may also depend on manufacturers\u2019 ability to obtain vendor financing through banks and factoring companies. To the extent they are unable to secure sufficient credit, they may not be able to sell to us at acceptable terms. We purchase a significant amount of goods from Cardinal Health, McLane and several large domestic and import vendors and any disruption in that supply and or pricing of such merchandise, whether due to a vendor\u2019s unwillingness to do business with us, supply chain issues or otherwise, could negatively impact our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we experience business interruptions or disruptions in the distribution process, our profitability could be materially affected.\nWe rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores timely and cost effectively. Using various transportation modes, we and our vendors move goods from vendor locations to our distribution centers and our stores. Any disruption, unanticipated or unusual expense or operational failure related to this process (for example, delivery delays or increases in transportation costs, including increased fuel costs, carrier or driver wages as a result of driver shortages; a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments; labor shortages; or work stoppages for slowdowns) could negatively impact sales and profits. Labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delivery delays or that necessitate our securing alternative labor or shipping suppliers could also increase our costs or otherwise negatively affect our business.\nWe may not anticipate, respond adequately to or control all of the challenges of operating our distribution operations. In the event that the orderly receipt and distribution of merchandise is disrupted, impeding the timeliness or fulfillment quality of the products being distributed, or any of our distribution centers becomes inaccessible, or is otherwise not fully usable, it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to distribute our products, which in turn would have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, financial condition and operating performance.\nOur financial condition may impair our ability to obtain favorable credit terms or to do business with certain of our vendors or have other adverse consequences.\nOur financial condition may make it difficult for us to continue to receive favorable payment terms with certain of our vendors or may result in one or more of our vendors making demand for adequate assurance, which could include a demand for prepayment, or suspending their business with us. Furthermore, in the event we are unable or otherwise elect not to pay some or all of our vendors, our vendors may further tighten credit terms, suspend or terminate their business with us, charge penalty interest or exercise other remedies against us. If we are unable to obtain reasonable payment terms or any of our vendors suspend or terminate their business with us, charge penalty interest or take other remedies against us, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.\nChanges in consumer demand and product mix and changes in overall economic conditions could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demands and preferences for product mix. A general slowdown in the United States economy, rising personal debt levels, rising foreclosure rates, personal bankruptcies, rising fuel prices, or changes in government aid, social security and other means that many of our customers rely upon may adversely affect the spending of our consumers, which would likely result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, changes in the types of products available for sale and the selection of products by our customers affect sales, product mix and margins. Future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income, such as employment levels, business conditions, fuel and energy costs, inflation, interest rates and tax rates, could also adversely affect our business by reducing consumer spending or causing consumers to shift their spending to other products. We might be unable to anticipate these buying patterns and implement appropriate inventory strategies, which would adversely affect our sales and gross profit performance. In addition, increases in fuel and energy costs would increase our transportation costs and overall cost of doing business and could adversely affect our financial statements as a whole.\nOur advertising, marketing and promotional strategies may be ineffective.\nOur profitability and results of operations may be materially affected by the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures and our ability to select the right markets and media in which to advertise. In particular, we may not be successful in our efforts to create greater awareness of our stores and promotions, identify the most effective and efficient level of spending in each market and specific\n- 20 -\nmedia vehicle or determine the appropriate creative message and media mix for our advertising, marketing and promotional expenditures. Our planned marketing expenditures may not result in increased revenues.\nChanges in our ability to attract and retain employees and changes in employee health care benefits and other insurance costs could adversely affect our business.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by our inability to attract and retain employees at the store operations level, in distribution facilities and at the corporate level, including our senior management team. In recent years, we have experienced significant turnover at the corporate level, including among senior management. Senior management transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause disruption to our business. As a result of the changes in our senior management team over the past several years, our current management team has taken on substantially more responsibility, which has resulted in greater workload demands and could divert attention away from other key areas of our business. In addition, senior management transition inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, may result in additional costs in the form of severance payments, may be disruptive to our daily operations or affect public or market perception, any of which could negatively impact our ability to operate effectively or execute our strategies and result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The marketplace for such key employees is very competitive and limited. Additionally, the retail industry generally has a high turnover rate; therefore, there is a continuous need to recruit and train new store managers and employees. Our failure to retain or successfully replace key personnel at the corporate level may have an adverse effect on our business. Other factors that impact our ability to maintain sufficient levels of qualified employees in all areas of the business include, but are not limited to, our reputation, employee morale, the current macroeconomic environment, competition from other employers and our ability to offer adequate compensation packages. Adverse changes in health care costs could also adversely impact our ability to achieve our operational and financial goals and to offer attractive benefit programs to our employees.\nWe rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business.\nMany key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees. The loss of their services could adversely affect our business. In particular, the loss of the services of one or more members of our executive team, including our Chief Executive Officer, Joseph Anto, could disrupt our operations. We do not have employment agreements with these executives and we cannot assure the retention of our employees. Further, we do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies on any of our employees. As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees.\nWe are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, gift cards and mobile payment technologies, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements and related interpretations may change over time, which could make compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements, or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired. In addition, our reputation could suffer, and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which could result in higher costs and/or reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nA significant disruption in our computer systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process customer transactions and record results. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches and natural disasters. If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business. We license the software programs supporting many of our systems from independent software developers. The inability of these vendors, developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these systems and software programs could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our\n- 21 -\noperations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner and could expose us to greater risk of a cyberattack. In addition, costs and delays associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations and adversely affect our profitability.\nIf we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customers, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our reputation could suffer.\nThe nature of our business involves the receipt of personal information about our customers and employees. If we experience a data security breach, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions, credit card brand assessments and fines and private litigation. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information, which could cause them to discontinue usage of credit cards in our stores, decline to use our pharmacy department services, or stop shopping at our stores altogether. Such events could lead to lost future sales and adversely affect our results of operations.\nCyber-attacks could affect our business.\nThe protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to our businesses. Cybersecurity and other information technology security risks, such as a significant breach of customer, employee, or company data, could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. Throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services, fill prescriptions, enroll in promotional programs, participate in our customer loyalty programs, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. In addition, aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Like other domestic companies, we interact with other businesses that may experience threats to their data and systems, including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card information, and cause system failures and disruptions. If our information technology (\"IT\") systems are breached due to a cyber-attack, we could experience a material disruption to our IT systems as well as data loss that could have an adverse effect on our business. We could experience operational delays due to the disruption of our IT systems. Future results could be negatively impacted by data theft, destruction or loss, or unplanned release of confidential information.\nRegulatory, Legal and Accounting Risks\nWe are subject to a broad and complex regulatory framework and may be unable to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable government regulation may result in fines and/or penalties, a loss of licensure, registration and approval or other government enforcement action.\nOur business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. In addition, during the past several years, the United States health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and enforcement activity at both the federal and state levels. Further, uncertainties exist regarding the application of many of these legal requirements to our business. Changes in these laws and regulations and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the continued operation of our business, including, but not limited to: imposition of civil or criminal penalties; significant fines or monetary penalties; suspension or disgorgement of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications or approvals; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; or loss of registrations or licensure.\nThe regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: the laws and regulations described in the Government Regulation section of Item 1 of this Form 10-K; accounting standards; financial disclosure; securities laws and regulations; federal and state laws and regulations relating to our employees, including those relating to wages, benefits or workplace requirements; federal laws relating to trade, including tariffs and quotas; federal anti-trust laws; tax laws and regulations and their possible reform; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous materials and wastes; and laws and regulations of the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state boards of pharmacy and other federal and state regulatory authorities, governing the sale, advertisement and promotion of products that we sell, such as alcoholic beverages, tobacco and drugs. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (\u201cATF\u201d), Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d), DEA and other regulatory agencies regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid ATF, FDA, DEA and state-level registrations and licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state-controlled substances acts and their accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding and distribution of controlled substances. The ATF, DEA, FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend our registrations and licenses, seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of\n- 22 -\nthese laws and regulations. We are also subject to the terms of various government agreements and mandates, including those described in the Government Regulation section. In that regard, our business, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by existing and new government legislative, regulatory action and enforcement activity, including, without limitation, any one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws and regulations concerning the submission of claims for reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs;\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws and regulations governing the purchase, distribution, tracking, management, dispensing and reimbursement of prescription drugs and related services and applicable registration or licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nheighted enforcement of controlled substances regulations;\n\u2022\nthe effect of the expiration of patents covering brand name drugs and the introduction of generic products;\n\u2022\nthe frequency and rate of approvals by the FDA of new brand name and generic drugs, or of over-the-counter status for brand name drugs;\n\u2022\nrules and regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA and the HITECH Act; and other federal and state laws affecting the collection, use, disclosure and transmission of health or other personal information, such as federal laws on information privacy precipitated by concerns about information collection through the Internet, state security breach laws and state laws limiting the use and disclosure of prescriber information;\n\u2022\nhealth care fraud and abuse laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nconsumer protection laws affecting our health care services, the products we sell, the informational calls we make and/or the marketing of our goods and services;\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our business, including the management of hazardous substances, storage and transportation of hazardous materials and various recordkeeping disclosure and procedure requirements promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that may apply to our operations;\n\u2022\nhealth care reform, managed care reform and plan design legislation;\n\u2022\nlaws against the corporate practice of medicine;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulation of the development, administration, review and updating of formularies and drug lists including requirements and/or limitations around formulary tiering and patient cost sharing;\n\u2022\ndrug pricing legislation, including \u201cmost favored nation\u201d pricing;\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws and regulations establishing or changing prompt payment requirements for payments to retail pharmacies;\n\u2022\nimpact of network access legislation or regulations, including \u201cany willing provider\u201d laws, on our ability to manage pharmacy networks;\n\u2022\nERISA and related regulations;\n\u2022\nadministration of Medicare Part D, including legislative changes and/or CMS rulemaking and interpretation;\n\u2022\nMedicare and Medicaid regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nongoing compliance from time to time with any consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, corrective action plans and other agreements with government agencies;\n\u2022\ninsurance licensing and other insurance regulatory requirements applicable to offering Medicare Part D programs and services or other health care services; and\n- 23 -\n\u2022\ndirect regulation of pharmacies by regulatory and quasi-regulatory bodies.\nAdverse impacts associated with legal proceedings and claims could affect our business.\nWe operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings and subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities arising in the course of our businesses, including those contained in Note 11, Other Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities and class action litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. In addition, under the qui tam or \u201cwhistleblower\u201d provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts, persons may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of \u201cfalse\u201d claims to federal and/or state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. From time to time, we may also be involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims.\nDespite our best efforts to ensure the quality and safety of the products we sell, we may be subject to product liability claims from customers or penalties from government agencies relating to products, including food products that are recalled, defective or otherwise alleged to be harmful. Such claims may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling and transportation of products the Company sells. All of our vendors and their products must comply with applicable product and food safety laws. We generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our suppliers. However, if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign suppliers may be hindered by the manufacturers' lack of understanding of U.S. product liability or other laws, which may make it more likely that we be required to respond to claims or complaints from customers as if we were the manufacturer of the products. Even with adequate insurance and indemnification, such claims could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products. Our litigation expenses could increase as well, which also could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations, even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued.\nIncreases in our insurance-related costs could significantly affect our business.\nThe costs of many types of insurance and self-insurance, especially workers\u2019 compensation and employee health care, could be subject to increases due to rising health care costs, legislative changes, economic conditions, terrorism and heightened scrutiny of insurance brokers and insurance providers. Our pharmacy departments are also exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, including with respect to improper filling of prescriptions, labeling of prescriptions and adequacy of warnings, and are significantly dependent upon suppliers to provide safe, government-approved and non-counterfeit products. We also sell a variety of products that we purchase from a large number of suppliers, including some who operate in foreign countries, which could become subject to contamination, product tampering, mislabeling or other damage. Our pharmacists may also have a duty to warn customers regarding any potential negative effects of a prescription drug if the warning could reduce or negate these effects. Although we maintain professional liability and errors and omissions liability insurance, from time to time, claims result in the payment of significant amounts, some portions of which are not funded by insurance. While we maintain reasonable quality assurance practices, no program can provide complete assurance that a product liability issue will not arise. Should a product liability issue arise, the coverage limits under our insurance programs may not be adequate to protect us against future claims. In addition, we may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. Damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability issue could have an adverse effect on our business. If our insurance-related costs increase significantly, or we are unable to renew our insurance policies or protect against all the business risks facing us, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to potential changes in public policy, laws and regulations, including reform of the United States health care system, that can adversely affect the markets for our products and services and our businesses, operations, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe political environment in which we operate remains uncertain. It is reasonably possible that our business operations and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by legislative, regulatory and public policy changes at the federal or state level,\n- 24 -\nincreased government involvement in drug reimbursement, pricing and/or purchasing, increased regulation of pharmacy benefit managers (\u201cPBMs\u201d), changes to Medicare, Medicaid or the regulatory environment for health care benefits, including the PPACA, changes to drug reimbursement and/or pricing laws and regulations, changes to the laws and regulations governing PBMs\u2019, prescription drug plans (\u201cPDPs\u201d) and/or Managed Medicaid organizations\u2019 interactions with government funded health care programs, changes to immigration policies and/or many other public policy initiatives. For example, in January 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) proposed regulations that would exclude from the current safe harbor under the federal anti-kickback statute manufacturer\u2019s rebates on prescription drugs paid to PBMs, PDPs and Managed Medicaid organizations in connection with federally funded health care programs. It is not possible to predict whether or when any such changes will occur or what form any such changes may take (including through the use of United States Presidential Executive Orders). If we fail to respond adequately to such changes, including by implementing strategic and operational initiatives, or do not do so as effectively as our competitors, our businesses, operations and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition to efforts to amend, repeal or replace the PPACA and related regulations, we expect the federal and state governments to continue to enact and seriously consider many broad-based legislative and regulatory proposals that will or could materially impact various aspects of the health care and related benefits system and our businesses. Potential modification to the PPACA, including changes in enforcement and/or funding that further destabilize the public exchanges, as well as significant changes to Medicaid funding could impact the number of Americans with health insurance and, consequently, prescription drug coverage. Further changes to federal health care laws, including the PPACA, drug reimbursement and pricing laws and/or laws governing PBMs\u2019, PDPs\u2019 and/or Managed Medicaid organizations\u2019 interactions with government funded health care programs, are probable. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that new health care legislation, future changes to the PPACA or the implementation or failure to implement the outstanding provisions of PPACA, may have on our business and/or results of operations. The federal and many state governments also are considering changes in the interpretation, enforcement and/or application of existing programs, laws and regulations, including changes to payments under and funding of Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nWe cannot predict the enactment or content of new legislation and regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations or their enforcement, interpretation or application, or the effect they will have on our business operations or results of operations, which could be materially adverse. Even if we could predict such matters, it is not possible to eliminate the adverse impact of public policy changes that would fundamentally change the dynamics of one or more of the industries in which we operate. Examples of such change include: the federal or one or more state governments fundamentally restructuring or reducing the funding available for Medicare, Medicaid, dual eligible or dual eligible special needs plan programs, increasing its involvement in drug reimbursement, pricing and/or purchasing, changing the laws and regulations governing PBMs\u2019, PDPs\u2019 and/or Managed Medicaid organizations\u2019 interactions with government funded health care programs, changing the tax treatment of health or related benefits, or repealing or otherwise significantly altering the PPACA. The likelihood of adverse changes remains high due to state and federal budgetary pressures, and our businesses and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by such changes, even if we correctly predict their occurrence. For more information on these matters, see \u201cGovernment Regulation\u201d included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe federal government has created the potential for significant changes in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores. Potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of trade agreements and the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our stores is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our operations and our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes and other taxes in the U.S. The determination of our provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTCJA\u201d) significantly changed income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations and there are aspects of the TCJA that remain unclear as additional guidance from the U.S. tax authority is pending. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance.\nTax assessments and unclaimed property audits by governmental authorities could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe remit a variety of taxes and fees to various governmental authorities, including federal and state income taxes, excise taxes, property taxes, sales and use taxes and payroll taxes. The taxes and fees remitted by us are subject to review and audit by the applicable governmental authorities which could result in liability for additional assessments. In addition, we are subject to unclaimed property (escheat) laws which require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others held by us that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time. We may be subject to audit by individual U.S. states with regard to our escheatment practices. The\n- 25 -\nlegislation and regulations related to tax and unclaimed property matters tend to be complex and subject to varying interpretations by both government authorities and taxpayers. Although management believes that the positions we have taken are reasonable, various taxing authorities may challenge certain of the positions we have taken, which may also potentially result in additional liabilities for taxes, unclaimed property, interest and penalties in excess of accrued liabilities. Our positions are reviewed as events occur such as the availability of new information, the lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, the conclusion of tax audits, the measurement of additional estimated liabilities based on current calculations, the identification of new tax contingencies or the rendering of relevant court decisions. An unfavorable resolution of assessments by a governmental authority could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.\nNew accounting guidance or changes in the interpretation or application of existing accounting guidance could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe implementation of new accounting standards could require certain systems, internal process and controls and other changes that could increase our operating costs, and will result in changes to our financial statements. For example, the implementation of accounting standards related to leases, as issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, is requiring us to make significant changes to our lease management and other accounting systems. The adoption of the standard is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated statement of financial position for the addition of lease assets and liabilities.\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or in underlying management assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance. The outcome of such changes could include litigation or regulatory actions which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nMatters relating to, or arising from, the material weaknesses in our internal controls may have a materially adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition, including increased costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention. We may identify additional material weaknesses in internal controls or significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures in the future. If we fail to remediate the identified material weaknesses, or if we otherwise fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we may be adversely affected.\nOur management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures and an assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting, was not effective as of February 2, 2019. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. See Item 9A. Controls and Procedures for additional information regarding the material weaknesses that our management identified. Should we be unable to remediate the material weaknesses promptly and effectively, such weaknesses could harm our operating results, result in a material misstatement of our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations or prevent us from providing reliable and accurate financial reports or avoiding or detecting fraud. This, in turn, could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock performance. Any litigation or other proceeding or adverse publicity relating to the material weaknesses could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, we may incur unanticipated accounting and legal fees in connection with these matters, and our management\u2019s time and attention has been diverted from our other business operations, which could harm our business.\nWe may identify additional material weaknesses in internal controls or significant deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures in the future. If we fail to remediate the identified material weaknesses, or if we otherwise fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, detect or prevent fraud, or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may, among other adverse consequences, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and lead to a decline in our stock price.\nFinancial and Economic Risks\nCurrent economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations by negatively impacting our customers\u2019 disposable income or discretionary spending, affecting our ability to plan and execute our strategic initiatives, increasing our costs of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses and adversely affecting our sales or profitability.\nWe believe many of our customers have fixed or low incomes and generally have limited discretionary spending dollars. Any factor that could adversely affect that disposable income would decrease our customers\u2019 confidence, spending, and number of trips to our stores, and could cause our customers to shift their spending to products other than those sold by us or to our less profitable product choices, all of which could result in lower net sales, decreases in inventory turnover, greater markdowns on inventory, a change in the mix of products we sell and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins. Factors that could reduce our customers\u2019 disposable income and\n- 26 -\nover which we exercise no influence include but are not limited to adverse economic conditions such as increased or sustained high unemployment or underemployment levels, inflation, increases in fuel or other energy costs and interest rates, lack of available credit, consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, uncertainty regarding government mandated participation in health insurance programs, increasing healthcare and housing costs and decreases in, or elimination of, government aid programs such as unemployment and food assistance programs.\nMany of the factors identified above that affect disposable income, as well as commodity rates, transportation costs (including the costs of fuel), costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, lease costs, measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade (including increased import duties or tariffs), or changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors, also affect our ability to plan and execute our strategic initiatives, our cost of goods sold, our selling, general and administrative expenses, and our real estate costs, and may have other adverse consequences which we are unable to fully anticipate or control, all of which may adversely affect our sales or profitability. We have limited or no ability to control many of these factors.\nIn addition, we operate a number of stores in areas that are experiencing a lower or slower recovery than the economy on a national level following the economic downturn that began in late 2007. A softening or slow recovery in consumer spending may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. Reduced revenues as a result of decreased consumer spending may also reduce our liquidity and otherwise hinder our ability to implement our long-term strategy.\nChanges in third-party reimbursements, including government programs, could adversely affect our business.\nA significant portion of our sales are funded by federal and state governments and private insurance plans. For the years ended February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018, pharmaceutical sales were 32.0% and 29.7% of total sales, respectively. The healthcare industry is experiencing a trend toward cost-containment with governments and private insurance plans seeking to impose lower reimbursements and utilization restrictions while also moving to a more outcomes-based payment model. Payments made under such programs may not remain at levels comparable to present levels or be sufficient to cover our cost. Private insurance plans may base their reimbursement rates on government rates. Accordingly, reimbursements may be limited or reduced, thereby adversely affecting our revenues and cash flows. Also, access to existing and/or new patients may be hindered or prevented through the implementation of preferred or restricted pharmacy provider networks ultimately impacting the financial results of the pharmacy department. Additionally, and in light of the current macroeconomic environment and recent healthcare legislation such as the PPACA, which includes provisions that are specific to our pharmacy department, government or private insurance plans may adjust scheduled reimbursement payments to us in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nWe have substantial debt and may incur additional debt, which could adversely affect our financial health, reduce our profitability, limit our ability to obtain financing in the future and pursue certain business opportunities and make payments on our indebtedness. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful.\nWe have substantial indebtedness. As of April 30, 2019, we had total indebtedness of approximately $91.3 million. The amount of our debt or other similar obligations could have important consequences for us, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes and our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness may be impaired in the future;\n\u2022\nwe are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because a portion of our borrowings is at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nwe may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt or with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and that, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns;\n\u2022\nour ability to refinance indebtedness may be limited or the associated costs may increase;\n\u2022\nour ability to engage in acquisitions without raising additional equity or obtaining additional debt financing may be impaired in the future;\n- 27 -\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nour flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and our ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited, or we may be prevented from making capital investments that are necessary or important to our operations in general, growth strategy and efforts to improve operating margins of our business units.\nOur ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under the Revolving Credit Agreement or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce, or delay marketing spend and/or capital expenditures, sell assets, close additional stores, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In the case of dispositions, we may not be able to consummate them for fair market value or at all. Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due.\nOur variable-rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nCertain of our indebtedness, including borrowings under our Revolving Credit Agreement, is subject to variable rates of interest and exposes us to interest rate risk. Interest rates, while historically low, have recently begun to increase. When interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income decreases. Such increases in variable interest rates could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Revolving Credit Agreement contains restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability and the ability of most of our subsidiaries to engage in certain business and financial transactions.\nOur Revolving Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries (other than certain excluded subsidiaries) to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022\npay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions;\n\u2022\nmake acquisitions, investments and loans;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into hedging arrangement; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs or could otherwise restrict our activities. These restrictions could also adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\n- 28 -\nOur failure to satisfy financial covenants or other obligations under our credit facility could harm our financial condition and materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nUnder the Revolving Credit Agreement, an \u201cAccount Control Event\u201d occurs if either an event of default is continuing, or excess availability falls below the greater of $26,250,000 and 12.5% of the commitments, following which time, and for certain periods thereafter, the administrative agent may apply all amounts in our collection accounts to the repayment of the loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement. On April 15, 2019, Bank of America, N.A. imposed an additional reserve of $20.0 million under our Revolving Credit Agreement in connection with our previously-announced closures of 159 stores and related matters, which reduced our excess availability at such time to $37.9 million, and the administrative agent declared an Account Control Event in connection with such closures and exercised control over our collection accounts. Furthermore, we have a financial covenant to maintain at all times excess availability of at least the greater of $21,000,000 and 10% of the commitments, and if excess availability falls below such threshold, it would constitute an event of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement. As of April 30, 2019, we had $78.3 million outstanding under our Revolving Credit Agreement and our excess availability was $37.1 million. Our failure to comply with the financial covenants and other obligations under our Revolving Credit Agreement would result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness and other remedies. Moreover, our Revolving Credit Agreement has a maturity date of April 9, 2020, and there is no assurance that our lenders would extend this facility or that refinancing would be available.\nAs described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the audit report prepared by our auditors with respect to the financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt about Fred\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The receipt of this explanatory paragraph with respect to Fred\u2019s financial statements for the year ended February 2, 2019 will result in a breach of a covenant under the Revolving Credit Agreement that requires annual financial statements accompanied by an unqualified audit report to be delivered to the lenders within 120 days of fiscal year end and a breach of this covenant will constitute an event of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement (the \u201cGoing Concern Event of Default\u201d). In addition, Fred\u2019s lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement have indicated to Fred\u2019s their belief that certain other events of default have occurred under the Revolving Credit Agreement in connection with the Closures, the inventory sales at certain stores and the timing of delivery, and content, of a borrowing base certificate due under the Revolving Credit Agreement (such purported events of default, together with the Going Concern Event of Default, are referred to herein as the \u201cRevolver EODs\u201d). While Fred\u2019s is currently seeking an agreement with its lenders pursuant to which such lenders would forbear for a period of time from seeking remedies on account of, or waive, the Revolver EODs, but there is no assurance that Fred\u2019s will receive such forbearance or waivers.\nIf our indebtedness is accelerated, whether due to the Revolver EODs or otherwise, or matures, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the indebtedness at such time or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition and could impact our ability to continue as a going concern.\nDespite our indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur more indebtedness, which may increase the risks to our financial condition created by our substantial indebtedness.\nThe terms of our Revolving Credit Agreement provide us and certain of our subsidiaries with flexibility to incur certain additional indebtedness in the future, which indebtedness may be secured or unsecured. Any such incurrence of additional indebtedness may increase the risks created by our current substantial indebtedness.\nWe may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.\nAny reductions in or restrictions on our available borrowing capacity, or our inability to renew or replace our debt facilities, when required or when business conditions warrant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, our Revolving Credit Agreement has a maturity date of April 9, 2020, and if this facility matures or is accelerated prior to maturity, whether due to the Revolver EODs or otherwise, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to renew or refinance such facility on terms acceptable to us or at all. The economic conditions, credit market conditions and economic climate affecting our industry, as well as other factors, may constrain our financing abilities. Our ability to secure additional financing, if available, and to satisfy our financial obligations in connection with indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance, the availability of credit generally, economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The market conditions and the macroeconomic conditions that affect our industry could have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure financing on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe may be unable to secure additional financing or financing on favorable terms or our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under the indebtedness outstanding from time to time. Furthermore, if financing is not available when needed, or is available on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution.\n- 29 -\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nProvisions in our charter, Tennessee law and our amended and restated rights plan may discourage potential acquirers of the Company.\nOur charter documents contain provisions that may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or attempt to acquire control of the Company. In addition, we are subject to certain provisions of Tennessee law that limit, in some cases, our ability to engage in certain business combinations with significant shareholders. In addition, we have adopted a shareholder rights plan, which provides, among other things, that when specified events occur, our shareholders will be entitled to purchase from us shares of junior preferred stock. The shareholder rights plan is currently scheduled to expire on September 18, 2020, except as otherwise set forth in the plan.\nThese provisions, either alone or in combination with each other, give our current directors and executive officers a substantial ability to influence the outcome of a proposed acquisition of the Company. These provisions would apply even if an acquisition or other significant corporate transaction was considered beneficial by some of our shareholders. If a change in control or change in management is delayed or prevented by these provisions, the market price of our securities could decline.\nOur principal stockholder has substantial control over our business, which may be disadvantageous to other stockholders.\nAs of May 3, 2019, Alden Global Capital LLC. (\u201cAlden\u201d), and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately 37% of our outstanding common stock. Moreover, three directors nominated by or affiliated with Alden currently serve on our Board. As a result of its control of a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock, Alden and its affiliates may have substantial control over matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. Alden and its affiliates may have interests that are different from those of other stockholders.\nThe Company has several shareholders that beneficially own more than 5% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock and exercise the related voting rights of those shares. Actions by these shareholders, including trading activity, could have a material adverse impact on the trading price of our stock.\nCertain of our shareholders, including Alden, each beneficially own more than 5% of the outstanding common stock of the Company. The daily trading activity in our stock is substantially lower, on average, than the total amount of shares owned by these shareholders. Any substantial trading activity executed by these large shareholders could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the Company\u2019s stock which may impact our ability to raise capital through equity financing, which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business plan.\nWe have engaged in transactions with our affiliates and expect to do so in the future. The terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be in our or our stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nIn the past, we have engaged in transactions with affiliated companies and may do so again in the future. These transactions, and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise in connection with such related party transactions, including pricing, duration or other terms of service, may not always be in our or our stockholders\u2019 best interests. While an effort has been made, and will continue to be made, to enter into transactions with affiliated persons and other related parties at rates and on terms as favorable as would be charged by others, there will always be an inherent conflict of interest between our interests and those of our affiliates and related parties.\nIf the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly, your investment could lose value.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Select Global Market, we cannot assure you that an active public market will continue for our common stock. If an active public market for our common stock does not continue, the trading price and liquidity of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected. If there is a thin trading market or \u201cfloat\u201d for our stock, the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a large float, our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile. In addition, in the absence of an active public trading market, investors may be unable to liquidate their investment in us. Furthermore, the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors, including:\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of our review of strategic alternatives;\n- 30 -\n\u2022\nour failure to continue as a going concern\n\u2022\nchanges in our earnings estimates;\n\u2022\ninvestment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in the business, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors;\n\u2022\nour failure to achieve operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in industry, general market or economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nannouncements of legislative or regulatory changes.\nThe stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price.\nOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock will depend on our ability to generate sufficient positive earnings and cash flows.\nOur ability to begin paying dividends again in the future will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, cash flows and restrictive covenants under our Revolving Credit Agreement and any future credit agreements to which we may be a party. Our cash available for dividends will principally be generated from our operations. Our ability to begin paying dividends again depends primarily on cash flows, including cash flows from changes in working capital, and not solely on profitability, which is affected by noncash items. As a result, we may be unable to pay cash dividends even during periods when we record net income.\nA change of control could limit our use of net operating losses.\nIf we were to experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as determined under Section 382 of the Code, our ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with NOLs generated prior to the ownership change would be limited, possibly substantially. In general, an ownership change would establish an annual limitation on the amount of our pre-change NOLs we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any future taxable year to an amount generally equal to the value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the then applicable \u201clong-term tax-exempt rate.\u201d In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in our ownership of more than 50 percentage points by one or more \u201c5% shareholders\u201d (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) at any time during a rolling three-year period.\nAs of February 2, 2019, we had a net operating loss, or NOL, carry forward of approximately $118.0 million for federal income tax purposes.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.", "PERMNO": 77420, "SIC": 5331, "TIC": "FREDQ"}
