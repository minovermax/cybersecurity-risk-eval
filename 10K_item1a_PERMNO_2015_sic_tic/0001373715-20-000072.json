You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making an investment decision. We have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. Our stock price could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\nWe participate in intensely competitive markets, and if we do not compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed.\nThe markets for our enterprise cloud solutions are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry. As the market for digital workflow products matures and new technologies and competitors enter the market, we expect competition to intensify. Our current competitors include:\n\u2022\nlarge, well-established, enterprise application software vendors and large integrated systems vendors;\n\u2022\nnew entrants to the market developing technologies to solve similar problems in different ways;\n\u2022\nsolutions developed in-house by our potential customers or using integrations with other tools;\n\u2022\nvendors of infrastructure-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service and development operations; and\n\u2022\nestablished and emerging cloud vendors.\nMany prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to ours. Many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer relationships (including at the executive level of large enterprises where decision-making authority is held), larger marketing budgets and greater resources than we do. While we believe that our platform and products can largely be complementary to large and established systems that traditionally operate as \u201csystems of record,\u201d competitors may try to enter our space. They may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, customer requirements and buying practices. They may utilize acquisitions, integrations or consolidations to offer integrated or bundled products, enhanced functionality or other advantages. They may reduce the price of products or subscriptions that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and subscriptions, causing our products to appear relatively more expensive. They may also invest in industry-specific solutions that purport to provide a unique solution for that industry. Other potential competitors not currently offering competitive products may expand their services to compete with our services, or we may shift our products and services to compete with current and future competitors in adjacent markets. We have in the past expanded, and we expect to continue to expand the breadth of our services to include offerings in new markets and the use of our platform by developers of custom applications. As a result, we expect increasing competition from platform vendors and application development vendors focused on these other markets. Smaller competitors and new entrants may accelerate pricing pressures, including in the ITSM market, which is our more mature offering and from which we derive a large portion of our revenues. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully, and competition could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance, any of which could harm our business.\nPrivacy laws and concerns, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions, other foreign and domestic regulations and standards related to data and the Internet may adversely affect our business.\nNational and local governments or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws and regulations affecting data privacy, the use of the Internet as a commercial medium, the use of data in contexts referred to as artificial intelligence and machine learning, and data sovereignty requirements concerning the location of data centers that store and process data. As a cloud based service provider, we optimize performance of our products and services by utilizing data centers that may be located in different political jurisdictions. In addition, we utilize data concerning the use of our products and services to continually improve our offering. Changing laws, regulations and standards applying to the collection, transfer, processing, storage or use of data, including personal data, could affect our ability to develop our products and services to maximize their utility, as well as our customers\u2019 ability to use and share data, potentially restricting our ability to store, process and share data with our customers in connection with providing our services. In some cases, this could impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our customers\u2019 ability to deploy our services globally. Examples of recent changes include:\n\u2022\nIn 2016, the European Union (the EU) adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR), which took effect in May 2018 and established new requirements applicable to the handling of personal data. The particular obligations imposed by GDPR are subject to interpretation, and different regulators may interpret requirements inconsistently. Further, laws such as the EU\u2019s proposed e-Privacy Regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information , the tracking of individuals\u2019 online activities and the \u201cright to be forgotten,\u201d requiring a company to delete certain information about individuals upon their request in certain circumstances.\n\u2022\nIn January 2020, Britain exited the EU (Brexit). Although we do not believe Brexit will require us to alter our operations in any material way to comply with privacy regulations in the EU and the United Kingdom (the UK), Brexit has and may continue to cause uncertainty for our customers.\n\u2022\nIn early 2020, the European Court of Justice is expected to give its ruling on a case regarding the validity of the Privacy Shield framework and the Standard Contractual Clauses (the SCCs), which are lawful transfer mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EU to the US (under the Privacy Shield framework) and other third countries deemed to have inadequate protection by the European Commission (under the SCCs). While we do not believe there will be any material impact to our business if the Privacy Shield is invalidated, there may be an impact to our ability to process personal data in certain jurisdictions where we operate if the SCCs are invalidated by the European Court of Justice.\n\u2022\nIn January 2020,the California Consumer Privacy Act (the CCPA) in the US took effect and broadly defines personal information and provides California consumers increased privacy rights and protections. The CCPA, among other things, affords California consumers new abilities to opt out of certain sales of personal information. Legislators have amended the CCPA since it passed in 2018 and implementing regulations are yet to be finalized by the California Attorney General. In addition, other nations and U.S. states and the federal government have discussed, are passing or may pass, future legislation similar to the GDPR and/or the CCPA, or with other data localization or sovereignty requirements.\n\u2022\nBoth US and non-US governments are considering the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in both consumer and business contexts and whether there is any need for regulation in these areas.\nThe costs of compliance with, and other obligations imposed by, the GDPR, the e-Privacy Regulation, the CCPA and other privacy, data residency and data transfer laws, regulations and standards may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to modify our data handling practices and/or policies, may limit the development, use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. In addition, non-compliance could result in proceedings or investigations against us by regulatory authorities or others, lead to significant fines or reputational harm and may otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. For example, the GDPR imposes significant new obligations and compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply with the GDPR or if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the GDPR, we may be subject to fines of up to 4% of our worldwide annual revenue. Changes in our developed or acquired products and how such products utilize data could alter or increase our compliance requirements. As a result, the cost of compliance with and other obligations imposed by privacy regulations could increase and our innovation and business drivers in developing or acquiring new and emerging technologies and the demand for our products could be impacted.\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and other technology and industry groups have established or may establish various new or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional obligations on us. Our customers may expect us to meet voluntary certifications or adhere to other standards established by third parties. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business.\nIf we do not accurately predict, prepare for, and respond promptly to rapidly evolving technological, market and customer developments, our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed.\nWe compete in markets that continue to evolve rapidly. The pace of innovation will continue to accelerate as customers increasingly base their purchases on digital technologies and capabilities, including public and private cloud solutions and infrastructure, massively scalable databases, mobile, consumer product-like user experiences, social, collaboration, machine learning, artificial intelligence, Internet-connected devices, high-velocity robotic automation, security, cryptography, internal software development operations, and application and service awareness. Our customers and prospective customers must choose among competing imperatives to adopt digital technologies, or have been built on fully-digital, modern, dynamic IT technologies. Accordingly, to compete effectively, we must: identify and innovate in the right emerging technologies, knowing that we cannot make substantial investments in all of them; accurately predict our customers\u2019 changing business needs, priorities and adoption practices, including their technology infrastructures and buying and budgetary practices; invest in and continually optimize our own technology platform so that it continues to meet the very high performance expectations of our customers; successfully deliver new, scalable platform and database technologies and products to meet these needs and priorities; efficiently integrate with other technologies within our customers\u2019 digital environments; expand our offerings into industries and to buyers who are not familiar with our offerings; profitably market and sell products to companies and buyers in markets where our sales and marketing teams have less experience, including to companies built on fully-digital, modern, dynamic IT technologies that have not been strong buyers of ITSM and ITOM products; and effectively deliver, either directly or through our partner ecosystem, the business process planning, IT systems architecture planning, and product implementation services that our customers require to be successful. If we fail to meet any of these requirements, our competitive position, strategic relevance and business prospects may be harmed.\nDelays in the release of, or actual or perceived defects in, new or updated products may slow the adoption of our most recent technologies, reduce our ability to efficiently provide our services, decrease customer satisfaction, and adversely impact sales of additional products to our customers.\nWe must successfully continue to release new products and updates to existing products. The success of any release depends on a number of factors, including our ability to manage the risks associated with quality or other defects or deficiencies, delays in the timing of releases or the adoption of releases by customers, and other complications that may arise during the early stages of introduction. If releases are delayed or if customers perceive that our releases contain bugs or other defects or are difficult to implement, customer adoption of our new products or updates may be adversely impacted, customer satisfaction may decrease, our ability to efficiently provide our services may be reduced, and our growth prospects may be harmed.\nWe do business with federal, state and local governments and agencies, and heavily-regulated U.S. and foreign organizations; as a result, we face risks related to the procurement process, budget decisions driven by statutory and regulatory determinations, termination of contracts, and compliance with government contracting requirements.\nWe provide products and services to the U.S. government, state and local governments and heavily-regulated organizations directly and through our partners. We have made, and may continue to make, significant investments to support future sales opportunities in the federal, state and local government sectors. This includes obtaining additional cloud security certification requirements for the ServiceNow GovCommunityCloud, such as the U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) High Impact Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO) from the Joint Authorization Board, and the U.S. Department of Defense Impact Level 4 P-ATO in the Security Requirements Guide for cloud computing by the Defense Information Systems Agency. However, government certification requirements may change, or we may be unable to achieve or sustain one or more government certifications, including those mentioned above. As a result, our ability to sell into the government sector could be restricted until we obtain such certifications.\nA substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our distribution and reseller partners. Doing business with government entities presents a variety of risks. The procurement process for governments and their agencies is highly competitive, time-consuming and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to political influence. We incur significant up-front time and expense, such as through engaging lobbyists, which subjects us to additional compliance risks and costs, without any assurance that we (or a third-party distributor or reseller) will win a contract. Beyond this, demand for our products and services may be adversely impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding availability that in any given fiscal cycle may be reduced or delayed, including in connection with an extended federal government shutdown. Further, if we are or our partner is successful in receiving a bid award, that award could be challenged by one or more competitive bidders. Bid protests may result in an increase in expenses related to obtaining contract awards or an unfavorable modification or loss of an award. In the event a bid protest is unsuccessful, the resulting delay in the startup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nIn addition, public sector customers may have contractual, statutory or regulatory rights to terminate current contracts with us or our third-party distributors or resellers for convenience or due to a default, though such risk may be assumed by such third-party distributor or reseller. If a contract is terminated for convenience, we may only be able to collect fees for products or services delivered prior to termination and settlement expenses. If a contract is terminated due to a default, we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the customer for procuring alternative products or services or be precluded from doing further business with government entities. Further, entities providing services to governments are required to comply with a variety of complex laws, regulations, and contractual provisions relating to the formation, administration, or performance of government contracts that give public sector customers substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts. These may include rights with respect to price protection, the accuracy of information provided to the government, contractor compliance with supplier diversity policies, and other terms that are particular to government contracts, such as termination rights. These rules may apply to us and/or third-party resellers or distributors whose practices we may not control. Such parties\u2019 non-compliance could impose repercussions with respect to contractual and customer satisfaction issues.\nIn addition, federal, state, and local governments routinely investigate and audit contractors for compliance with these requirements. If, as a result of an audit, it is determined that we have failed to comply with these requirements, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, cost associated with the triggering of price reduction clauses, fines, and suspensions or debarment from future government business, and we may suffer reputational harm.\nFurther, we are increasingly doing business in heavily regulated industries, such as the financial services and health care industries. Current and prospective customers, such as those in these industries, may be required to comply with more stringent regulations in connection with subscribing to and implementing our services or particular regulations regarding third-party vendors that may be interpreted differently by different customers. In addition, regulatory agencies may impose requirements toward third-party vendors generally, or our company in particular, that we may not be able to, or may not choose to, meet. In addition, customers in these heavily-regulated areas often have a right to conduct audits of our systems, products and practices. In the event that one or more customers determines that some aspect of our business does not meet regulatory requirements, we may be limited in our ability to continue or expand our business.\nOur customers also include a number of non-U.S. governments, to which similar procurement, budgetary, contract, and audit risks of U.S. government contracting also apply, particularly in certain emerging markets where our customer base is less established. In addition, compliance with complex regulations and contracting provisions in a variety of jurisdictions can be expensive and consume significant management resources. In certain jurisdictions, our ability to win business may be constrained by political and other factors unrelated to our competitive position in the market. Each of these difficulties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on our network of partners for an increasing portion of our revenues, and if these partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products may be limited, and our operating results and growth rate may be harmed.\nAn increasing portion of our revenues is generated by sales through our network of partners, including managed service providers and resellers. In addition, we increasingly rely on our partners to provide professional services, including customer implementations. While we provide our partners with training and programs, including accreditations and certifications, these programs may not be effective or utilized consistently. In addition, new partners may require extensive training and may require significant time and resources to achieve productivity. Our partners may subject us to lawsuits, potential liability, and reputational harm if, for example, any of our partners misrepresent the functionality of our platform or products to customers, fail to perform services to our customers\u2019 expectations, or violate laws or our corporate policies. In addition, our partners may utilize our platform to develop products and services that could potentially compete with products and services that we offer currently or in the future. Concerns over competitive matters or intellectual property ownership could constrain these partnerships. If we fail to effectively manage and grow our network of partners, or properly monitor the quality and efficacy of their service delivery, our ability to sell our products and efficiently provide our services may be impacted, and our operating results and growth rate may be harmed.\nIf we are unsuccessful in increasing our penetration of international markets or managing the risks associated with foreign markets, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nSales outside of North America represented approximately 34% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Our business and future prospects depend on increasing our international sales as a percentage of our total revenues. The failure to grow internationally will harm our business. Additionally, operating in international markets requires significant investment and management attention and subjects us to different regulatory, political and economic risks from those in the United States (the US). We have made, and will continue to make, substantial investments in data centers, cloud computing infrastructure, sales, marketing, personnel and facilities as we enter and expand in new geographic markets. When we make these investments, it is typically unclear whether, and when, sales in the new market will justify our investments. We may significantly underestimate the level of investment and time required to be successful, or whether we will be successful. Our rate of acquisition of new large enterprise customers, a factor affecting our growth, has generally been lower in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, South America and other markets in which we are less established and where there may be increased or changing regulations and operational and intellectual property risks, as compared to North America, Australia and Western Europe. An increasing proportion of the large enterprises that are not yet our customers are located in emerging markets where we are less established. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, difficulties in some of our investments in geographic expansion, including hiring qualified sales management personnel, penetrating the target market, anticipating and ensuring compliance with regulatory developments, and managing foreign operations in such locales.\nRisks inherent with making our products and services available in international markets include without limitation:\n\u2022\ncompliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, competition, requirements to have local partner(s), local entity ownership limitations, technology transfer or sharing requirements, data residency and transfer laws and regulations, privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including the GDPR;\n\u2022\ncompliance by us and our business partners with international bribery and anti-corruption laws, including the UK Bribery Act and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the FCPA);\n\u2022\nthe risk that illegal or unethical activities of our local employees or business partners will be attributed to or result in liability to us or damage to our reputation;\n\u2022\nlonger and potentially more complex sales and accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties;\n\u2022\ntax treatment of revenues from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding, income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ndifferent pricing and distribution environments;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which may cause transactional and translational remeasurement losses;\n\u2022\npotential changes in international trade policies, tariffs, agreements and practices, including the adoption and expansion of formal or informal trade restrictions or regulatory frameworks favoring local competitors;\n\u2022\npotential threatening state-sponsored actions, including cybersecurity threats directed at local data centers, customers or end-users;\n\u2022\nlocal business practices and cultural norms that may favor local competitors; and\n\u2022\nlocalization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses.\nIf we are unable to manage these risks, if our required investments in these international markets are greater than anticipated, or if we are unsuccessful in increasing sales in emerging markets, our revenue growth rate, business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nAs we acquire or invest in companies and technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions and investments may divert our management\u2019s attention and result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nWe have acquired or invested in companies and technologies in the past as part of our business strategy and may continue to evaluate and execute potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of or investments in businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets in the future. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our service offerings, functionality or our ability to provide services in international locations, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution, discount pricing or investments in other companies. Although we conduct reasonably extensive due diligence with each of the entities we engage for a strategic transaction, our due diligence efforts may not reveal every material concern that may exist either with respect to the target entity or our assumptions surrounding the resulting combination. These strategic transactions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nassimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\nfailing to achieve the expected benefits of the acquisition or investment;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business;\n\u2022\npotential adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\ndisruption to our business and diversion of management attention and other resources;\n\u2022\npotential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers;\n\u2022\ndependence on acquired technologies or licenses for which alternatives may not be available to us without significant cost or complexity;\n\u2022\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the challenges associated with integrating operations across different cultures and languages and any currency and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u2022\nincreased data privacy or security compliance requirements resulting from integrating the acquired technology or company with ours; and\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses.\nIn addition, we may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity or equity-linked securities to pay for any future acquisitions, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or our stock price. Furthermore, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity, convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect our stock price. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Operation of Our Business\nIf we or our third-party service providers suffer a cyber-security event, we may lose customers and incur significant liabilities, any of which would harm our business and operating results.\nOur operations involve the storage, transmission and processing of our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary and sensitive data, including personally identifiable information, protected health information, financial information and, in some cases, government information. While we have security measures in place designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss, these measures may be breached because of employee error or third-party actions, including unintentional events or deliberate attacks by cyber criminals, and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. In addition, third parties have attempted and may continue to attempt to fraudulently induce employees, contractors, or users to disclose information to gain access to our data or our customers\u2019 data, and we may be the target of email scams that attempt to acquire personal information or company assets. Additionally, because we do not control our third-party service providers or their processing of data, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of measures they take to protect customer information and prevent data loss. Computer malware, viruses, hacking, phishing and denial of service attacks by third parties have become more prevalent in our industry, and they have occurred on our and our third-party service providers\u2019 systems in the past and may occur again on these systems in the future. Because techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and generally are not detected until successfully launched against a target, we have been and may continue to be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We devote significant financial and personnel resources to implement and maintain security measures; however, as cyber-security threats develop and grow more complex over time, it may be necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. A security breach suffered by us or our third-party service providers, an attack against our service availability or unauthorized access or loss of data could result in a disruption to our service, litigation, the triggering of service availability, indemnification and other contractual obligations, regulatory investigations, government fines and penalties, reputational damage, loss of sales and customers, mitigation and remediation expenses and other significant costs and liabilities. In addition, we may incur significant costs and operational consequences of investigating, remediating, eliminating, complying with notice obligations and implementing additional measures designed to prevent actual or perceived security incidents. We also cannot be certain that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover the potentially significant losses that may result from a security incident or breach or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\nFurther, in most instances, our customers administer access to the data held in their particular instance for their employees and service providers. We offer tools and support for what we believe are best practices to maintain security utilizing our services, but customers are not required to utilize those tools or follow our suggested practices. As a result, or for other reasons, a customer may suffer a cyber-security event on its own systems, unrelated to our own, and allow a malicious actor to obtain access to the customer\u2019s information held on our platform. Even if such a breach is unrelated to our security programs or practices, such breach could result in our incurring significant economic and operational costs in investigating, remediating, eliminating and implementing additional measures to further protect our customers from their own vulnerabilities, and could result in reputational harm to us.\nIf we lose key employees or are unable to attract and retain the employees we need, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our management team, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and many key individual contributors. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. For example, our current President and Chief Executive Officer was appointed in November 2019 and our current Chief Financial Officer was appointed in January 2020. While we seek to manage these transitions carefully, including by establishing strong processes and procedures and succession planning, such changes may result in a loss of institutional knowledge and cause disruptions to our business.\nIn the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and Internet-related solutions, sales executives and operations personnel. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, and we may experience increased compensation and training costs that may not be offset by either improved productivity or higher sales. We have from time to time experienced, and we may continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly-skilled employees with appropriate qualifications, and may not be able to fill positions in desired geographic areas or at all. In particular, competition for experienced software and cloud computing infrastructure engineers in the San Francisco Bay area, San Diego, Seattle, London, Amsterdam and Hyderabad, our primary operating locations, is intense. Many of our employees, including all of our executive officers, are employed \u201cat-will\u201d and may terminate their employment with us at any time. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we believe our corporate culture of fostering innovation, teamwork and employee satisfaction has been a key contributor to our success to date. As we continue to grow and expand globally, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success.\nNatural disasters and other events beyond our control could harm our business.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, flooding, fire, power shortages, pandemics such as the recent spread of the coronavirus, terrorism, political unrest, telecommunications failure, vandalism, cyber-attacks, geopolitical instability, war, the effects of climate change (such as drought, wildfires, increased storm severity and sea level rise) and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, could decrease demand for our services, and could cause us to incur substantial expense. Our insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses or additional expense that we may sustain. The majority of our research and development activities, corporate offices, information technology systems, and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in California and Washington. Customer data could be lost, significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected in the event of a major natural disaster or catastrophic event.\nVarious factors, including our customers\u2019 business, integration, migration and security requirements, or errors by us, our partners, or our customers, may cause implementations of our products to be delayed, inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful.\nOur business depends upon the successful implementation of our products by our customers. Increasingly, we and our customers rely on our network of partners to deliver implementation services, and there may not be enough qualified implementation partners available to meet customer demand. Further, our customers\u2019 business, integration, migration and security requirements, or errors by us, our partners, or our customers, or other factors may cause implementations to be delayed, inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful. For example, changes in the functional requirements of our customers, delays in timeline, or deviations from recommended best practices may occur during the course of an implementation project. As a result of these and other risks, we or our customers may incur significant implementation costs in connection with the purchase, implementation and enablement of our products. Some customer implementations may take longer than planned or fail to meet our customers\u2019 expectations, which may delay our ability to sell additional products or result in customers canceling or failing to renew their subscriptions before our products have been fully implemented. Some customers may lack the employee talent or organizational capacity to manage a digital transformation such as our offering and, as a consequence, may be unable to see the benefits of our products. Unsuccessful, lengthy, or costly customer implementation and integration projects could result in claims from customers, reputational harm, and opportunities for competitors to displace our products, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nDisruptions or defects in our services could damage our customers\u2019 businesses, subject us to substantial liability and harm our reputation and financial results.\nFrom time to time, we experience defects in our services, and new defects may be detected in the future. For example, we provide regular updates to our services, which frequently contain undetected defects when first released. Defects may also be introduced by our use of third-party software, including open source software. Disruptions may result from errors we make in developing, delivering, configuring or hosting our services, or designing, installing, expanding or maintaining our cloud infrastructure. Disruptions in service can also result from incidents that are outside of our control, including denial of service attacks. We currently serve our customers primarily using equipment managed by us and co-located in third-party data centers operated by several different providers located around the world, and we plan to serve certain of our customers using data center facilities operated by public cloud service providers. These data centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, power loss and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, equipment failure and adverse events caused by operator error or negligence. Despite precautions taken at these centers, problems at these centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our services and the loss of customer data. In addition, our customers may use our services in ways that cause disruptions in service for other customers. Our customers use our services to manage important aspects of their businesses, and our reputation and business will be adversely affected if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable. Disruptions or defects in our services may reduce our revenues, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, subject us to claims and litigation, cause our customers to delay payment or terminate or fail to renew their subscriptions, and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers. Similarly, customers may have unique requirements for system resiliency that we may not be able to, or may not choose to, meet. The occurrence of payment delays, service credit, warranty or termination for material breach or other claims against us could result in an increase in our bad debt expense, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable, an increase to our service level credit accruals, other increased expenses or risks of litigation. We may not have insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that may result from claims arising from disruptions in our services.\nRisks Related to the Financial Performance or Financial Position of Our Business\nOur operating results may vary significantly from period to period, and if we fail to meet the financial performance expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.\nOur operating results may vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, some of which are beyond our control. For any quarterly or annual period, there is a risk that our financial performance will not meet the financial guidance we have previously given for that period, or that we may otherwise fail to meet the financial performance expectations of the securities analysts who issue reports on our company and our common stock price, or of investors in our common stock. There is also a risk that we may issue forward-looking financial guidance for a quarterly or annual period that fails to meet the expectations of such securities analysts or investors. If any of the foregoing occurs, for any reason, either within or outside of our control, the price of our common stock could decline substantially and investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses. Some of the important factors that may cause our financial performance to vary widely, or cause our forward-looking financial guidance to fall below the expectations of such securities analysts or investors, include:\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new customers, retain and increase sales to existing customers, and satisfy our customers\u2019 requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges in our mix of products and services, including changes in our mix of cloud and self-hosted offerings, market penetration of our products, or use of our products by our customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to increase sales of certain emerging products;\n\u2022\nvolatility in foreign currency exchange rates and our ability to effectively hedge our foreign currency exposure;\n\u2022\nthe rate of expansion, retention and productivity of our sales force;\n\u2022\nthe number of new employees added;\n\u2022\nthe cost, timing and management effort for our development of new products and services;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions that may adversely affect our customers\u2019 or a prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operation and expansion of our business;\n\u2022\nseasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements;\n\u2022\nthe length and complexity of the sales cycle and certification process for our services, especially for sales to larger enterprises, government and regulated organizations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the size and complexity of our customer relationships;\n\u2022\nchanges to our management, sales and account management teams as we scale and as a result of evolving business priorities;\n\u2022\nchanges in our or our competitors\u2019 pricing policies;\n\u2022\nsignificant security breaches, technical difficulties or interruptions of our services;\n\u2022\nnew solutions or products introduced by our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in effective tax rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in the average contract term of our customer agreements, timing of renewals, renewal rates, expansion within our existing customers and billings duration;\n\u2022\nthe timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers;\n\u2022\nextraordinary expenses such as litigation costs or damages, including settlement payments;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration, including the tax effects of acquisitions;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations impacting the delivery of our services;\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with privacy laws and regulations, including the GDPR and the CCPA;\n\u2022\nsignificant litigation or regulatory actions relating to claims of intellectual property infringement, violation of privacy laws, employment matters or any other significant matter;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of equity awards and the related financial statement expenses;\n\u2022\nthe impact of new accounting pronouncements; and\n\u2022\nour ability to accurately estimate the total addressable market for our products and services.\nLawsuits against us by third parties that allege we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and operating results.\nThere is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry. Many companies in our industry, including our competitors, other third parties and non-practicing entities, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, which they may use to assert claims of patent infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us.\nMoreover, the patent portfolios of many of our competitors are larger than ours. This disparity may increase the risk that our competitors may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent cross-licenses. From time to time, our competitors or other third parties, including patent holding companies seeking to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained, may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. For example, we recorded charges for aggregate legal settlements of $270.0 million in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2016. The charges covered the fulfillment by us of all financial obligations under settlement agreements with BMC and HPE, with no remaining financial obligations to BMC or HPE under either settlement.\nIn any intellectual property litigation, regardless of the scope or merits of the claims at issue, we may incur substantial attorney\u2019s fees and other litigation expenses and, if the claims are successfully asserted against us and we are found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others, we could be required to: pay substantial damages and/or make substantial ongoing royalty payments; cease offering our products and services; modify our products and services; comply with other unfavorable terms, including settlement terms; and indemnify our customers and business partners and obtain costly licenses on their behalf and refund fees or other payments previously paid to us. Further, upon expiration of the term of any third-party agreements that allow us to use their intellectual property, we may be unable to renew such agreements on favorable terms, if at all, in which case we may face intellectual property litigation. The mere existence of any lawsuit, or any interim or final outcomes, and the course of its conduct and the public statements related to it (or absence of such statements) by the courts, press, analysts and litigants could be unsettling to our customers and prospective customers. This could cause an adverse impact to our customer satisfaction and related renewal rates, cause us to lose potential sales, and could also be unsettling to investors or prospective investors and cause a substantial decline in our stock price. Any claim or litigation against us could be costly, time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nIf we fail to comply with anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA and similar laws of other countries, and general trade regulations, including but not limited to economic sanctions and embargoes, we could be subject to penalties and civil and/or criminal sanctions and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7201, the UK Bribery Act, and possibly other anti-bribery laws in countries in which we conduct activities. We face significant risks if we fail to comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws that prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from promising, authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to foreign government officials, political parties, and private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person, or securing any advantage. In addition, we use various third parties to sell our products and services and conduct our business both in the US and abroad. We or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. We have implemented and continue to update an anti-corruption compliance program but there is a risk that our employees and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, could take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible.\nAs we continue to expand our business internationally, we will inevitably do more business with large enterprises and the public sector in countries that are perceived to have heightened levels of public sector corruption. Increased business in countries perceived to have heightened levels of corruption could subject us and our officers and directors to increased scrutiny and increased liability from our business operations. In addition, we are subject to compliance with general trade regulations relating to doing business outside the US, including certain restrictions on conducting trade in certain restricted countries or with certain entities or individuals.\nAny violation of the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or general trade regulations by our employees or our third-party intermediaries could result in regulatory investigations, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage and/or severe criminal or civil sanctions, which could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results, and prospects. In addition, responding to any enforcement action may result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs.\nOur intellectual property protections may not provide us with a competitive advantage, and defending our intellectual property may result in substantial expenses that harm our operating results.\nOur success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand under patent and other intellectual property protections of the US and other jurisdictions. Though we seek patent protection for our technology, we may not be successful in obtaining patent protection, and any patents acquired in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigation. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer services. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the US, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights or available remedies may be inadequate. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We have initiated and, in the future, may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and may result in counter-claims with respect to infringement of intellectual property rights by us. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property, or are required to incur substantial expenses defending our intellectual property rights, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur use of open source software could harm our ability to sell our products and services and subject us to possible litigation.\nOur products incorporate software licensed to us by third-party authors under open source licenses, and we expect to continue to incorporate open source software into other products and services in the future. We attempt to monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our products and services to adverse licensing conditions. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts have been or will be successful. There is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of the terms of open source licenses, and therefore the potential impact of these terms on our business is uncertain and enforcement of these terms may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our products and services. For example, depending on which open source license governs open source software included within our products and services, we may be subjected to conditions requiring us to offer our products and services to users at no cost; make available the source code for modifications and derivative works based upon, incorporating or using the open source software; and license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. Moreover, if an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations, be subject to significant damages or be enjoined from distributing our products and services.\nBecause we generally recognize revenues from our subscription service over the subscription term, a decrease in new subscriptions or renewals during a reporting period may not be immediately reflected in our operating results for that period.\nWe generally recognize revenues from customers ratably over the terms of their subscriptions. Net new annual contract value from new subscriptions and expansion contracts entered into during a period can generally be expected to generate revenues for the duration of the subscription term. As a result, most of the revenues we report in each period are derived from the recognition of deferred revenues relating to subscriptions entered into during previous periods. Consequently, a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions in any single reporting period will have a limited impact on our revenues for that period. In addition, our ability to adjust our cost structure in the event of a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions may be limited.\nFurther, a decline in new subscriptions, expansion contracts or renewals in a given period may not be fully reflected in our revenues for that period, but they will negatively affect our revenues in future periods. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and changes in our rate of renewals, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues through additional sales in any period, as revenues from new customers are generally recognized over the applicable subscription term. Additionally, due to the complexity of certain of our customer contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d depends on contract-specific terms and may result in greater variability in revenues from period to period.\nIn addition, a decrease in new subscriptions, expansion contracts or renewals in a reporting period may not have an immediate impact on billings for that period due to factors that may offset the decrease, such as an increase in billings duration, the dollar value of contracts with future start dates, or the dollar value of collections in the current period related to contracts with future start dates.\nAs our business grows, we expect our revenue growth rate to continue to decline.\nWe have experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods; however, our longer-term revenue growth rate is declining, and we expect that it will continue to decline into the foreseeable future. We also expect our costs to increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our strategic priorities, which may not result in increased revenues or growth in our business. You should not rely on our revenue for any prior periods as any indication of our future revenue growth. If we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth, our stock price could be volatile.\nChanges in our effective tax rate or rejection of our tax position in jurisdictions outside the US could have a material impact on our financial position and results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the US and various foreign jurisdictions. We believe that our provision for income taxes is reasonable, but the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods in which such outcome is determined. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the effects of acquisitions. Increases in our effective tax rate would reduce our profitability or in some cases increase our losses.\nAdditionally, our future effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in accounting principles or changes in federal, state or international tax laws or tax rulings. The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law, which could affect our results of operations in the period issued. Many countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business. Recent global tax developments applicable to multinational businesses and increased scrutiny under tax examinations could have a material impact on our business and negatively affect our financial results. Any changes in federal, state or international tax laws or tax rulings may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may be subject to income tax audits by tax jurisdictions throughout the world, many of which have not established clear guidance on the tax treatment of cloud computing companies. Although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles, an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on our results of operations for that period. Further, many of our most important intangible assets are held outside the US and are subject to inter-company agreements regarding the development and distribution of those assets to other jurisdictions. While we believe that our position is appropriate and well founded, in the event that our position was to be successfully challenged by taxing authorities in other jurisdictions, we may become subject to significant tax liabilities, which could harm our financial position and financial results.\nWe may incur losses in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) during future periods.\nAlthough we have reported results that were profitable on a GAAP basis for full-year 2019 and certain prior quarters, we have incurred net losses in all prior fiscal years since our inception. Even if our revenues continue to increase, we may incur losses in accordance with GAAP during future periods due to increased costs such as non-cash charges associated with equity awards, business combinations and other expenses. We may also encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unpredictable factors that may result in increased costs. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict the size and growth rate of our market, customer demand for our products, customer adoption and renewal rates, and the entry of competitive products or the success of existing competitive products. As a result of these and other factors, we may not maintain profitability in the future, and our gross margins and ability to generate cash flow from operations may be negatively impacted. If we fail to increase our revenues sufficiently to keep pace with our growing investments and other expenses, our business, operating results and growth prospects will be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us, among other things, to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and the reasonable assurance level of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act annually. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating. Moreover, our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. If material weaknesses are identified or we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, our reported financial results could be materially misstated or could subsequently require restatement, we could receive an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm, we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities and we could incur substantial expenses. We may not be able to effectively implement system and process changes required for new standards on a timely basis. Any delays or failure to update our systems and processes could also lead to a material weakness or significant deficiency.\nRisks Related to General Economic Conditions\nGlobal economic conditions may harm our industry, business and results of operations.\nWe operate globally and as a result our business and revenues are impacted by global macroeconomic conditions. Global financial developments seemingly unrelated to us or the software industry may harm us. From time to time, the US and other key international economies have been impacted by geopolitical and economic instability, high levels of credit defaults, international trade disputes, falling demand for various goods and services, high levels of persistent unemployment, wage and income stagnation, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies, international trade agreements, trade restrictions and overall economic uncertainty. These conditions can arise suddenly and affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers\u2019 or prospective customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase our services, delay purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions, or affect renewal rates, all of which could harm our operating results.\nIn 2020, for example, the growth rate in the EU, China, or the US, tariffs or trade relations between the US and China or other countries, political uncertainty in the Middle East and other geopolitical events could directly or indirectly affect our business. Additionally, in connection with Brexit, the impact of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU is still to be fully seen, with the applicable trade agreement to be negotiated before December 2020, or a type of \u201cno-deal\u201d exit would occur. This could be harmful to both the U.K. and E.U. economies and businesses operating there\nIn addition, the effects, if any, of global financial conditions on our business can be difficult to distinguish from the effects on our business from product, pricing, and other developments in the markets specific to our products and our relative competitive strength. If we make incorrect judgments about our business for this reason, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations could harm our financial results.\nWe conduct significant transactions, including revenue transactions and intercompany transactions, in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar or the functional operating currency of the transactional entities. In addition, our international subsidiaries maintain significant net assets that are denominated in currencies other than the functional operating currencies of these entities. Accordingly, changes in the value of currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar may impact our consolidated revenues and operating results due to transactional and translational remeasurement that is reflected in our earnings. It is particularly difficult to forecast any impact from exchange rate movements, so there is risk that unanticipated currency fluctuations could adversely affect our financial results or cause our results to differ from investor expectations or our own guidance in any future periods. In addition, the announcement of Brexit and the continued uncertainty around the full impact of it and the exact trade arrangements upon exit has adversely impacted global markets, including currencies, and resulted in a decline and volatility in the value of the British pound and the Euro, as compared to the U.S. Dollar and other currencies. Volatility in exchange rates and global financial markets is expected to continue due to a number of factors, including uncertainty surrounding Brexit trade arrangements and the recent political and economic uncertainty globally.\nIn 2018, we began using derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forwards, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts may reduce, but cannot entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. Further, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates may result in poorer overall financial performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. Moreover, for a number of reasons, including our limited experience with these hedging contracts, we may not seek or be able to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the exposures being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge, and could expose us to a greater overall risk of loss than if we had not hedged.\nRisks Related to Our Convertible Senior Notes\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our convertible senior notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes) in cash or to repurchase the 2022 Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the 2022 Notes.\nHolders of the 2022 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2022 Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture for the 2022 Notes (the Indenture)) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any. In addition, if a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) occurs prior to the maturity date of the 2022 Notes, we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2022 Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Upon conversion of the 2022 Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2022 Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the 2022 Notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to the 2022 Notes being converted.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our future debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the Indenture from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the 2022 Notes when due. Furthermore, the Indenture prohibits us from being acquired unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the 2022 Notes and the Indenture. These and other provisions in the Indenture could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to holders of the 2022 Notes.\nIn addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2022 Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the 2022 Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the Indenture or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2022 Notes as required by the Indenture would constitute a default. A default under the Indenture or a fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. Moreover, the occurrence of a fundamental change could constitute an event of default under any such agreements. If the payment of the related indebtedness were accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the 2022 Notes, or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2022 Notes.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the 2022 Notes may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nPrior to the business day immediately preceding February 1, 2022, the holders of the 2022 Notes may elect to convert their notes during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to $175.18 (the Conversion Condition). The Conversion Condition for the 2022 Notes was met for all quarters ended June 30, 2018 through December 31, 2019, except for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Therefore, our 2022 Notes became convertible at the holders\u2019 option beginning on July 1, 2018 and continue to be convertible through March 31, 2020, except for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 because the Conversion Condition for the 2022 Notes was not met for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid cash to settle an immaterial principal amount of the 2022 Notes. Based on additional conversion requests we have received through the filing date, we expect to settle in cash an aggregate of approximately $2.5 million and $5.2 million in principal amount of the 2022 Notes during the first and second quarters of 2020, respectively. We may receive additional conversion requests that require settlement in the second quarter of 2020. If more holders elect to convert their 2022 Notes in future periods, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we may settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity and result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, to the extent we receive conversion requests, we may also record a loss on early conversions of the 2022 Notes converted by note holders based on the difference between the fair market value allocated to the liability component on the settlement date and the net carrying amount of the liability component and unamortized debt issuance on the settlement date.\nThe convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of the 2022 Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the sale of the 2022 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge (the 2022 Note Hedge) transactions with certain financial institutions (option counterparties). We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants for the purchase of our common stock (the 2022 Warrants). The 2022 Note Hedge is expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the 2022 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2022 Notes, as applicable. The 2022 Warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect to the extent that our stock price exceeds the exercise price of the 2022 Warrants, which is $203.40. As the 2022 Warrants will be net share settled, the total number of shares of our common stock we will issue depends on the daily volume-weighted average stock prices over a 60-trading day period beginning on the first expiration date of the 2022 Warrants, which will be September 1, 2022. We expect to issue additional shares of our common stock in the second half of 2022 upon the automatic exercise of the 2022 Warrants. Based on the volume-weighted average stock price on December 31, 2019, the total number of shares of our common stock to be issued upon the automatic exercise of the 2022 Warrants would be approximately 1.6 million. The actual number of shares of our common stock issuable upon the automatic exercise of the 2022 Warrants, if any, is unknown at this time. Refer to Note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nThe option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2022 Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2022 Notes, or following any repurchase of the 2022 Notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date (as defined in the Indenture) or otherwise). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in our stock price or the 2022 Notes price, which could affect note holders\u2019 ability to convert the 2022 Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2022 Notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that note holders will receive upon conversion of the 2022 Notes.\nThe potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on our stock price or the 2022 Notes price will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the 2022 Notes (and the resulting amount of cash and/or number of shares, if any, that note holders would receive upon the conversion) and, under certain circumstances, the ability of the note holders to convert the 2022 Notes.\nWe do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the 2022 Notes or our common stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that the option counterparties will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the 2022 Note Hedge.\nThe option counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them may default under the 2022 Note Hedge. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings, with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the stock price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has historically been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could subject us to litigation.\nOur stock price has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, technology companies in general have highly volatile stock prices, and the volatility in stock price and trading volume of securities is often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities. Factors affecting our stock price, some of which are beyond our control, include:\n\u2022\nchanges in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to cover our common stock;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products, services or technologies, new applications or enhancements to services, strategic alliances, acquisitions, or other significant events by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies, such as high-growth or cloud companies, investors perceive to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nchanges to our management team;\n\u2022\ntrading activity by directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or the market\u2019s perception that large stockholders intend to sell their shares;\n\u2022\nthe inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;\n\u2022\nthe size of our market float;\n\u2022\nthe volume of trading in our common stock, including sales upon exercise of outstanding options or vesting of equity awards or sales and purchases of any common stock issued upon conversion of the 2022 Notes or in connection with the 2022 Note Hedge and 2022 Warrant transactions;\n\u2022\nthe economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry, and the industries of our customers; and\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets.\nFollowing periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, so any returns will be limited to changes in our stock price.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock may be prohibited or limited by the terms of any future debt financing arrangements. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, of our stock price.\nProvisions in our charter documents, Delaware law, or our 2022 Notes might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress our stock price.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress our stock price by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\npermit the board to establish the number of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may only be removed \u201cfor cause\u201d and only with the approval of 66 2/3% of our shareholders;\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board could use to implement a shareholder rights plan;\n\u2022\ndo not permit our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit shareholder action by written consent, which requires all shareholder actions to be taken at a meeting;\n\u2022\nprovide that the board is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at annual shareholder meetings (though our bylaws have shareholder proxy access).\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.\nFurther, the fundamental change provisions of our 2022 Notes may delay or prevent a change in control of our company, because those provisions allow note holders to require us to repurchase such notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change.", "PERMNO": 13447, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "NOW"}
