Before you make a decision regarding our securities, in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed above under \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d you should carefully consider the specific risks set forth herein. If any of these risks actually occur, it may materially harm our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. As a result, the market price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additionally, the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may become material and adversely affect our business. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to the financial statements included herein.\nSummary of Principal Risks Associated with Our Business\nSet forth below is a summary of some of the principal risks we face:\n\u2022the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to mitigate its spread including its adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity;\n\u2022market-driven wage changes or changes to labor laws or wage or job classification regulations, including minimum wage:\n\u2022our ability to hire, timely train, and retain talented individuals for our workforce, and to maintain our corporate culture as we grow;\n\u2022developments with respect to retailers that are out of our control;\n\u2022our ability to continue to generate significant operating cash flow;\n\u2022consolidation within the industry of our clients creating pressure on the nature and pricing of our services;\n\u2022our reliance on continued access to retailers\u2019 platforms;\n\u2022consumer goods manufacturers and retailers reviewing and changing their sales, retail, marketing, and technology programs and relationships;\n\u2022our ability to successfully develop and maintain relevant omni-channel services for our clients in an evolving industry and to otherwise adapt to significant technological change;\n\u2022client procurement strategies putting additional operational and financial pressure on our services;\n\u2022our ability to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future;\n\u2022potential and actual harms to our business arising from the matter related to the 2018 acquisition of Take 5 Media Group (the \u201cTake 5 Matter\u201d);\n\u2022our ability to identify attractive acquisition targets, acquire them at attractive prices, and successfully integrate the acquired businesses;\n\u2022our ability to avoid or manage business conflicts among competing brands;\n\u2022difficulties in integrating acquired businesses;\n\u2022our substantial indebtedness and our ability to refinance at favorable rates;\n\u2022limitations, restrictions, and business decisions involving our joint ventures and minority investments;\n\u2022Our ability to respond to changes in digital practices and policies;\n\u2022exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks related to our international operations;\n\u2022the ability to maintain applicable listing standards;\n\u2022changes in applicable laws or regulations; and\n\u2022the possibility that we may be adversely affected by other political, economic, business, and/or competitive factors.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business and Industry\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to mitigate its spread have had, and are likely to continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, including the measures taken to mitigate its spread, have had, and are likely to continue to have, adverse effects on our business and operations. There are many uncertainties regarding the current COVID-19 pandemic, including the scope of potential public health issues, the anticipated duration of the pandemic and the extent of local and worldwide social, political and economic disruption it has caused and may cause in the future. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including restrictions on large gatherings, closures of face-to-face events and indoor dining facilities, \u201cshelter in place\u201d health orders and travel restrictions, have had far-reaching direct and indirect impacts on many aspects of our operations, including temporary termination of certain in-store demonstration services and other services, as well as on consumer behavior and purchasing patterns, in particular with respect to the foodservice industries, and declines in consumer demand for restaurant, school and hotel dining, where we promote our clients\u2019 products. Since March 2020, our marketing segment has experienced a significant decline in revenues, primarily due to the temporary suspension or reduction of certain in-store demonstration services and decreased demand in our digital marketing services, both of which we believe were caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the various governmental and private responses to the pandemic, and which may continue in the future. In our sales segment, we have experienced significant shifts in consumer spending preferences and habits. We can provide no assurances that the strength of that segment will continue or that we will be able to continue to evolve our business in the future as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our clients\u2019 businesses.\nWe have taken several actions in response to these business disruptions, including reducing certain of our discretionary expenditures, reducing our real estate foot print, through lease terminations and amendments (including abandoning several office leases prior to reaching termination agreements with its landlords), eliminating non-essential travel and terminating, furloughing or instituting pay reductions and deferrals for some of our associates. However, the pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our results of operations, including our revenues, our financial condition and liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, including:\n\u2022potential changes in the policies of retailers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including changes to or restrictions on their outsourcing of sales and marketing functions and restrictions on the performance of in-store demonstration services, if permitted at all;\n\u2022potential changes in the demand for services by our clients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022our ability to hire, timely train and retain talented individuals for our workforce;\n\u2022disruptions, delays and strains in certain domestic and internal supply changes that have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on the flow or availability of certain products;\n\u2022the need for us to adapt to technological change and otherwise develop and maintain omni-channel solutions;\n\u2022our ability to generate sufficient cash to service our substantial indebtedness;\n\u2022our ability to maintain our credit rating;\n\u2022\n\u2022our ability to offer high-quality customer support and maintain our reputation;\n\u2022our ability to identify, perform adequate diligence on and consummate acquisitions of attractive business targets, and then subsequently integrate such acquired businesses;\n\u2022our ability to maintain our corporate culture;\n\u2022severe disruption and instability in the U.S. and global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions, which could make it difficult for us to access debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all;\n\u2022our ability to effectively manage our operations while a significant amount of our associates continue to work remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022deteriorating economic conditions, declines in labor force participation rates, public transportation disruptions or other disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022potential cost-saving strategies implemented by clients that reduce fees paid to third-party service providers such as ourselves; and\n\u2022our ability to implement additional internal control measures to improve our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe cannot predict the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity as such effects will depend on how the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to develop. However, these effects may continue, evolve or increase in severity, each of which could further negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nMarket-driven wage increases and changes to wage or job classification regulations, including minimum wages could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMarket competition has and may continue to cause us to increase the salaries or wages paid to our associates or the benefits packages that they receive. If we experience further market-driven increases in salaries, wage rates or benefits or if we fail to increase our offered salaries, wages or benefits packages competitively, the quality of our workforce could decline, causing our client service to suffer. Low unemployment rates or lower levels of labor force participation rates may increase the likelihood or impact of such market pressures. Any of these changes affecting wages or benefits for our associates could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in labor laws related to employee hours, wages, job classification and benefits, including health care benefits, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately\n70,000 associates, many of whom are paid above, but near, applicable minimum wages, and their wages may be affected by changes in minimum wage laws.\nAdditionally, many of our salaried associates are paid at rates that could be impacted by changes to minimum pay levels for exempt roles. Certain state or municipal jurisdictions in which we operate have recently increased their minimum wage by a significant amount, and other jurisdictions are considering or plan to implement similar actions, which may increase our labor costs. Any increases at the federal, state or municipal level to the minimum pay rate required to remain exempt from overtime pay may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAn inability to hire, timely train and retain talented individuals for our workforce could slow our growth and adversely impact our ability to operate our business.\nOur ability to meet our workforce needs, while controlling associate-related costs, including salaries, wages and benefits, is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of talented persons in the workforce in the local markets in which we operate, prevailing unemployment rates and competitive wage rates in such markets. We may find that there is an insufficient number of qualified individuals to fill our associate positions with the qualifications we seek. Competition in these communities for qualified staff could require us to pay higher wages and provide greater benefits, especially if there is significant improvement in regional or national economic conditions. We must also train and, in some circumstances, certify these associates under our policies and practices and any applicable legal requirements. If we are unable to hire, timely train or retain talented individuals may result in higher turnover and increased labor costs, and could compromise the quality of our service, all of which could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and results of operations are affected by developments with and policies of retailers that are out of our control.\nA limited number of national retailers account for a large percentage of sales for our consumer goods manufacturer clients. We expect that a significant portion of these clients\u2019 sales will continue to be made through a relatively small number of retailers and that this percentage may increase if the growth of mass retailers and the trend of retailer consolidation continues. As a result, changes in the strategies of large retailers, including a reduction in the number of brands that these retailers carry or an increase in shelf space that they dedicate to private label products, could materially reduce the value of our services to these clients or these clients\u2019 use of our services and, in turn, our revenues and profitability. Many retailers have critically analyzed the number and variety of brands they sell, and have reduced or discontinued the sale of certain of our clients\u2019 product lines at their stores, and more retailers may continue to do so. If this continues to occur and these clients are unable to improve distribution for their products at other retailers, our business or results of operations could be adversely affected. These trends may be accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAdditionally, many retailers, including several of the largest retailers in North America, which own and operate a significant number of the locations at which we provide our services, have implemented or may implement in the future, policies that designate certain service providers to be the exclusive provider or one of their preferred providers for specified services, including many of the services that we provide to such retailers or our clients.\nSome of these designations apply across all of such retailers\u2019 stores, while other designations are limited to specific regions. If we are unable to respond effectively to the expectations and demands of such retailers or if retailers do not designate us as their exclusive provider or one of their preferred providers for any reason, they could reduce or restrict the services that we are permitted to perform for our clients at their facilities or require our clients to purchase services from other designated services providers, which include our competitors, either of which could adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nConsolidation in the industries we serve could put pressure on the pricing of our services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nConsolidation in the consumer goods and retail industries we serve could reduce aggregate demand for our services in the future and could adversely affect our business or our results of operations. When companies consolidate, the services they previously purchased separately are often purchased by the combined entity, leading to the termination of relationships with certain service providers or demands for reduced fees and commissions. The combined company may also choose to insource certain functions that were historically outsourced, resulting in the termination of existing relationships with third-party service providers. While we attempt to mitigate the revenue impact of any consolidation by maintaining existing or winning new service arrangements with the combined companies, there can be no assurance as to the degree to which we will be able to do so as consolidation continues in the industries we serve, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nConsumer goods manufacturers and retailers may periodically review and change their sales, retail, marketing and technology programs and relationships to our detriment.\nThe consumer goods manufacturers and retailers to whom we provide our business solutions operate in highly competitive and rapidly changing environments. From time to time these parties may put their sales, retail, marketing and technology programs and relationships up for competitive review, which may increase in frequency as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on the consumer goods manufacturers and retailer industries. We have occasionally lost accounts with significant clients as a result of these reviews in the past, and our clients are typically able to reduce or cancel current or future spending on our services on short notice for any reason. We believe that key competitive considerations for retaining existing and winning new accounts include our ability to develop solutions that meet the needs of these manufacturers and retailers in this environment, the quality and effectiveness of our services and our ability to operate efficiently. To the extent that we are not able to develop these solutions, maintain the quality and effectiveness of our services or operate efficiently, we may not be able to retain key clients, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur largest clients generate a significant portion of our revenues.\nOur three largest clients generated approximately 11% of our revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. These clients are generally able to reduce or cancel spending on our services on short notice for any reason. A significant reduction in spending on our services by our largest clients, or the loss of one or more of our largest clients, if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, when large retailers suspend or reduce in-store demonstration services, such as in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our business and results of operations can be adversely affected.\nWe are reliant on continued access to retailer platforms on commercially reasonable terms for the provision of certain of our e-commerce services in which our clients\u2019 products are resold by us, as the vendor of record, directly to the consumer.\nA growing portion of the e-commerce services we provide involve the purchase and resale by us, as the vendor of record, of our clients\u2019 products through retailer platforms. The control that retailers such as Amazon have over the access and fee structures and/or pricing for products on their platforms could impact the volume of purchases of these products made on their platform and our revenues from the provision of such e-commerce services. If such retailers establish terms that restrict the offering of these products on their platform, significantly impact the financial terms on which such products are offered, or do not approve the inclusion of such products on their platform, our business could be negatively impacted. Additionally, we also generally rely on a retailer\u2019s payment processing services for purchases made on its platform by consumers. To the extent such payment processing services are offered to us on less favorable terms, or become unavailable to us for any reason, our costs of revenue with respect to this aspect of our business could increase, and our margins could be materially adversely impacted. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining access to these retailer platforms on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe retail industry is evolving, and if we do not successfully develop and maintain relevant omni-channel services for our clients, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nHistorically, substantially all of our sales segment revenues were generated by sales and services that ultimately occurred in traditional retail stores. The retail industry is evolving, as demonstrated by the number of retailers that offer both traditional retail stores and e-commerce platforms or exclusively e-commerce platforms. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed pressure on the traditional retail store model, including store closures, changes in consumer spending, and extensive health and safety risks and compliance requirements. Consumers are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones and other devices to comparison shop, determine product availability and complete purchases online, a trend that has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, and which may continue thereafter. If consumers continue to purchase more products online and e-commerce continues to displace brick-and-mortar retail sales, there may be a decrease in the demand for certain of our services. Omni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving and we believe we will need to keep pace with the changing consumer expectations and new developments by our competitors.\nWhile we continue to seek to develop effective omni-channel solutions for our clients that support both their e-commerce and traditional retail needs, there can be no assurances that these efforts will result in revenue gains sufficient to offset potential decreases associated with a decline in traditional retail sales or that we will be able to maintain our position as a leader in our industry. If we are unable to provide, improve or develop innovative digital services and solutions in a timely manner or at all, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe may be unable to adapt to significant technological change, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe operate businesses that require sophisticated data collection, processing and software for analysis and insights. Some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly, particularly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will be required to continue to adapt to changing technologies, either by developing and marketing new services or by enhancing our existing services, to meet client demand.\nMoreover, the introduction of new services embodying new technologies, including automation of certain of our in-store services, and the emergence of new industry standards could render existing services obsolete. Our continued success will depend on our ability to adapt to changing technologies, manage and process increasing amounts of data and information and improve the performance, features and reliability of our existing services in response to changing client and industry demands. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful design, development, testing, introduction or marketing of our services. New services or enhancements to existing services may not adequately meet the requirements of current and prospective clients or achieve market acceptance.\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position depends on our ability to attract and retain talented executives.\nWe believe that our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts, abilities and relationships of our senior executives and the strength of our middle management team. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our senior executives, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time. The replacement of any of our senior executives likely would involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could therefore have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, we do not carry any \u201ckey person\u201d insurance policies that could offset potential loss of service under applicable circumstances. Furthermore, if we are unable to attract and retain a talented team of middle management executives, it may be difficult to maintain the expertise and industry relationships that our clients value, and they may terminate or reduce their relationship with us.\nClient procurement and fee reduction strategies could put additional operational and financial pressure on our services or negatively impact our relationships, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMany of our clients seek opportunities to reduce their costs through procurement strategies that reduce fees paid to third-party service providers. As a result, certain of our clients have sought, and may continue to seek, more aggressive terms from us, including with respect to pricing and payment terms. Such activities put operational and financial pressure on our business, which could limit the amounts we earn or delay the timing of our cash receipts. Such activities may also cause disputes with our clients or negatively impact our relationships or financial results. Our clients have experienced, and may continue to experience, increases in their expenses associated with materials and logistics, which may cause them to reduce expenses elsewhere. While we attempt to mitigate negative implications to client relationships and the revenue impact of any pricing pressure by aligning our revenues opportunity with satisfactory client outcomes, there can be no assurance as to the degree to which we will be able to do so successfully. Additionally, price concessions can lead to margin compression, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we fail to offer high-quality customer support, our business and reputation may suffer.\nHigh-quality education, training and customer support are important for successful marketing and sales and for the renewal of existing customers. Providing this education, training and support requires that our personnel who manage our online training resource or provide customer support have specific inbound experience domain knowledge and expertise, making it more difficult for us to hire qualified personnel and to scale up our support operations. The importance of high-quality customer support will increase as we expand our business and pursue new customers. If we do not help our customers use multiple applications and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional functionality and services to, or to retain, existing customers may suffer and our reputation with existing or potential customers may be harmed.\nWe may be adversely affected if clients reduce their outsourcing of sales and marketing functions.\nOur business and growth strategies depend in large part on companies continuing to elect to outsource sales and marketing functions. Our clients and potential clients will outsource if they perceive that outsourcing may provide quality services at a lower overall cost and permit them to focus on their core business activities and have done so in the past. We cannot be certain that the industry trend to outsource will continue or not be reversed or that clients that have historically outsourced functions will not decide to perform these functions themselves. Unfavorable developments with respect to outsourcing could adversely affect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nWe previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, investors\u2019 views of us could be harmed, and we could be subject to enforcement actions by the SEC.\nDuring 2021, we completed the remediation measures related to the material weaknesses previously identified and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.\nIf we are unable to identify attractive acquisition targets, acquire them at attractive prices or successfully integrate the acquired businesses, we may be unsuccessful in growing our business.\nA significant portion of our growth has been as a result of our acquisition of complementary businesses that grow our service offerings, expand our geographic reach and strengthen valuable relationships with clients. However, there can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition targets, that we will acquire them at attractive prices, that we will succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations or that such acquired businesses or technologies will be well received by our clients, potential clients or our investors. We could also encounter higher-than-expected earn-out payments, unforeseen transaction- and integration-related costs or delays or other circumstances such as disputes with or the loss of key or other personnel from acquired businesses, challenges or delays in integrating systems or technology of acquired businesses, a deterioration in our associate and client relationships, harm to our reputation with clients, interruptions in our business activities or unforeseen or higher-than-expected inherited liabilities. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies or the diversion of management time and attention.\nIn order for us to continue to grow our business through acquisitions we will need to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities and acquire them at attractive prices. We may choose to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. The sale of equity to finance any such acquisition could result in dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may encounter significant difficulties integrating acquired businesses.\nThe integration of any businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we have devoted, and will continue to devote, significant management attention and resources to integrating acquired businesses. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of our combined business and could adversely affect our results of operations. The difficulties of combining acquired businesses with our own include, among others:\n\u2022the diversion of management attention to integration matters;\n\u2022difficulties in integrating functional roles, processes and systems, including accounting systems;\n\u2022challenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the two companies;\n\u2022difficulties in assimilating, attracting and retaining key personnel;\n\u2022challenges in keeping existing clients and obtaining new clients;\n\u2022difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from an acquisition;\n\u2022difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex business;\n\u2022contingent liabilities, including contingent tax liabilities or litigation, that may be larger than expected; and\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences or unforeseen increased expenses associated with an acquisition, including possible adverse tax consequences to the combined business pursuant to changes in applicable tax laws or regulations.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control, and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreased expected revenues and diversion of management time and energy, all of which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. These difficulties have been enhanced further during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of our office closures and work-from home policies, which may hinder assimilation of key personnel.\nIf we are not able to successfully integrate an acquisition, if we incur significantly greater costs to achieve the expected synergies than we anticipate or if activities related to the expected synergies have unintended consequences, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur corporate culture has contributed to our success and, if we are unable to maintain it as we evolve, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe believe our corporate culture has been a significant factor in our success. However, as our company evolves, including through acquisitions and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as working remotely and reductions in workforce, it may be difficult to maintain our culture, which could reduce our ability to innovate and operate effectively. The failure to maintain the key aspects of our culture as our organization evolves could result in decreased employee satisfaction, increased difficulty in attracting top talent, increased turnover and compromised the quality of our client service, all of which are important to our success and to the effective execution of our business strategy. If we are unable to maintain our corporate culture as we evolve and execute our growth strategies, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nAcquiring new clients and retaining existing clients depends on our ability to avoid or manage business conflicts among competing brands.\nOur ability to acquire new clients and to retain existing clients, whether by expansion of our own operations or through an acquired business may in some cases be limited by the other parties\u2019 perceptions of, or policies concerning, perceived competitive conflicts arising from our other relationships. Some of our contracts expressly restrict our ability to represent competitors of the counterparty. These perceived competitive conflicts may also become more challenging to avoid or manage as a result of continued consolidation in the consumer goods and retail industries and our own acquisitions. If we are unable to avoid or manage business conflicts among competing manufacturers and retailers, we may be unable to acquire new clients or be forced to terminate existing client relationships, and in either case, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nLimitations, restrictions and business decisions involving our joint ventures and minority investments may adversely affect our growth and results of operations.\nWe have made substantial investments in joint ventures and minority investments and may use these and other similar methods to expand our service offerings and geographical coverage in the future. These arrangements typically involve other business services companies as partners that may be competitors of ours in certain markets. Joint venture agreements may place limitations or restrictions on our services. As part of our joint venture with, and investments in Smollan, we are restricted under certain circumstances from making direct acquisitions and otherwise expanding our service offerings into markets outside of North America and Europe. As a result of our acquisition of Daymon Worldwide Inc., or the Daymon Acquisition, pursuant to the terms of our arrangements with Smollan and our joint venture, Smollan and our joint venture may elect to purchase from us, and have purchased, certain Daymon business units that operate outside of North America. If Smollan or our joint venture do not elect to purchase those business units, we may, under certain circumstances, elect to retain, sell or discontinue those business units. The limitations and restrictions tied to our joint venture and minority investments limit our potential business opportunities and reduce the economic opportunity for certain prospective international investments and operations. Additionally, though we control our joint ventures, we may rely upon our equity partners or local management for operational and compliance matters associated with our joint ventures or minority investments. Moreover, our other equity partners and minority investments may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions, including actions or omissions, of a joint venture or other equity partner or management for a business unit may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us or adversely affect our growth and results of operations.\nOur international operations expose us to risks that could impede growth in the future, and our attempts to grow our business internationally may not be successful.\nWe continue to explore opportunities in major international markets. International operations expose us to various additional risks that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u2022costs of customizing services for clients outside of the United States;\n\u2022the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws;\n\u2022potential difficulty in enforcing contracts;\n\u2022being subject to U.S. laws and regulations governing international operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and sanctions regimes;\n\u2022being subject to foreign anti-bribery laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, such as the UK Bribery Act;\n\u2022reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022increased financial accounting and reporting complexity;\n\u2022additional legal compliance requirements, including custom and import requirements with respect to products imported to and exported across international borders;\n\u2022exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022exposure to local economic conditions;\n\u2022limitations on the repatriation of funds or profits from foreign operations;\n\u2022exposure to local political conditions, including adverse tax policies and civil unrest;\n\u2022the risks of a natural disaster, public health crisis (including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as the coronavirus), an outbreak of war, the escalation of hostilities and acts of terrorism in the jurisdictions in which we operate; and\n\u2022the disparate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the measures taken to mitigate its spread, across various jurisdictions.\nAdditionally, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d has created economic and political uncertainty, including volatility in global financial markets and the value of foreign currencies. The impact of Brexit may not be fully realized for several years. Additionally, in many countries outside of the United States, there has not been a historical practice of using third parties to provide sales and marketing services. Accordingly, while it is part of our strategy to expand into international markets, it may be difficult for us to grow our international business units on a timely basis, or at all.\nWe may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs.\nCurrently, none of our associates in the United States are represented by a union. However, our associates have the right under the National Labor Relations Act to choose union representation. If all or a significant number of our associates become unionized and the terms of any collective bargaining agreement were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could increase our costs and adversely impact our profitability. Moreover, if a significant number of our associates participate in labor unions, it could put us at increased risk of labor strikes and disruption of our operations or adversely affect our growth and results of operations. In December 2019, a union which commonly represents employees in the supermarket industry filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board to represent approximately 120 of our associates who work in and around Boston. An election was held, and based on certified results of the election we prevailed in this election. Notwithstanding this successful election, we could face future union organization efforts or elections, which could lead to additional costs, distract management or otherwise harm our business.\nIf goodwill or other intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions become impaired, we could take significant non-cash charges against earnings.\nWe have made acquisitions to complement and expand the services we offer and intend to continue to do so when attractive acquisition opportunities exist in the market. As a result of prior acquisitions, including the acquisition of our business in 2014 by our current parent entity, Karman Topco L.P. (\u201cTopco\u201d), we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet of $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021, as further described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nUnder accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually, whether the value of goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired. We have recognized non-cash goodwill and non-cash intangible asset impairment charges, and we can make no assurances that we will not record any additional impairment charges in the future. Any future reduction or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will similarly result in charges against earnings, which could adversely affect our reported financial results in future periods.\nFailures in, or incidents involving, our technology infrastructure could damage our business, reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nOur business is highly dependent on our ability to manage operations and process a large number of transactions on a daily basis. We rely heavily on our operating, payroll, financial, accounting and other data processing systems which require substantial support and maintenance, and may be subject to disabilities, errors, or other harms. If our data and network infrastructure were to fail, or if we were to suffer a data security breach, or an interruption or degradation of services in our data center, third-party cloud, and other infrastructure environments, we could lose important data, which could harm our business and reputation, and cause us to incur significant liabilities. Our facilities, as well as the facilities of third-parties that provide or maintain, or have access to our data or network infrastructure, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, cyber security attacks, terrorist attacks, power losses, telecommunications failures and similar events. In the event that our or any third-party provider\u2019s systems or service abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, our ability to operate may be impaired. Our information technology systems, and the information technology systems of our current or future third-party vendors, collaborators, consultants and service providers, could be penetrated by internal or external parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information, stealing intellectual property or trade secrets, or disrupting business processes. A third party\u2019s decision to close facilities or terminate services without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems, could adversely impact our operations. Any of the aforementioned risks may be augmented if our or any third-party provider\u2019s business continuity and disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate in preventing the loss of data, service interruptions, disruptions to our operations or damages to important systems or facilities. Our data center, third-party cloud, and managed service provider infrastructure also could be subject to break-ins, cyber-attacks (including through the use of malware, software bugs, computer viruses, ransomware, social engineering, and denial of service), sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct, from a spectrum of actors ranging in sophistication from threats common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries. Any security breach or incident, including personal data breaches, that we experience could result in unauthorized access to, or misuse, modification, destruction or unauthorized acquisition of, our internal sensitive corporate data, such as personal data, financial data, trade secrets, intellectual property, or other competitively sensitive or confidential data. Such unauthorized access, misuse, acquisition, or modification of sensitive data may result in data loss, corruption or alteration, interruptions in our operations or damage to our computer hardware or systems or those of our employees or customers. Our systems have been the target of cyber-attacks. Although we have taken and continue to take steps to enhance our cybersecurity posture, we cannot assure that future cyber incidents will not occur or that our systems will not be targeted or breached in the future. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in a disruption of the Company\u2019s operations, the theft, unauthorized use or publication of the Company\u2019s intellectual property, other proprietary information or the personal information of customers, employees, licensees or suppliers, a reduction of the revenues the Company is able to generate from its operations, damage to the Company\u2019s brand and reputation, a loss of confidence in the security of the Company\u2019s business and products, and significant legal and financial exposure. If any such incident results in litigation, we may be required to make significant expenditures in the course of such litigation and may be required to pay significant amounts in damages. We may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any events that cause interruptions in our service. Significant unavailability of our services due to attacks could cause us to incur significant liability, could cause users to cease using our services and materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use complex software in our technology infrastructure, which we seek to continually update and improve. Replacing such systems is often time-consuming and expensive and can also be intrusive to daily business operations. Further, we may not always be successful in executing these upgrades and improvements, which may result in a failure of our systems. We may experience periodic system interruptions from time to time. Any slowdown or failure of our underlying technology infrastructure could harm our business and reputation, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Our disaster recovery plan or those of our third-party providers may be inadequate, and our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for the losses that could occur.\nFailure to comply with federal, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nA variety of federal, state and foreign laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of personal information. The information, security and privacy requirements imposed by such governmental laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection are increasingly demanding, quickly evolving and may be subject to differing interpretations. These requirements may not be harmonized, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices. As a result, our practices may not have complied or may not comply in the future with all such laws, regulations, requirements and obligations. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in fines, investigations, enforcement actions, penalties, sanctions, claims for damages by affected individuals, and damage to our reputation, among other negative consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial performance.\nWe are subject to the California Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective in 2020 and regulates the collection, use and processing of personal information relating to California residents, and which grants certain privacy rights to California residents, including rights to request access to and to request deletion of personal information relating to such individuals under certain circumstances. Compliance with the new obligations imposed by the CCPA depends in part on how its requirements are interpreted and applied by the California attorney general and courts. Alleged violations of the CCPA may result in substantial civil penalties or statutory damages when applied at scale, up to $2,500 per violation or $7,500 per intentional violation of any CCPA requirement, which may be applied on a per-person or per-record basis. The CCPA also establishes a private right of action if certain personal information of individuals is subject to an unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft, or disclosure as a result of a business\u2019s violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices, which authorizes statutory damages $100 to $750 per person per incident even if there is no actual harm or damage to plaintiffs. This private right of action may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. Further, in November 2020, the State of California adopted the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (\u201cCPRA\u201d) which goes into effect January 1, 2023 and provides for expansion and amendment to the CCPA, including additional and strengthened privacy rights for California residents, new requirements regarding sensitive data and data sharing for digital advertising, and tripled damages for violations involving children\u2019s data. The CPRA establishes a dedicated privacy regulator under California law, with rulemaking and enforcement responsibilities. Regulations implementing the CPRA are expected in draft and final form in 2022, which will need to be accounted for in time for the CPRA\u2019s January 1, 2023 effective date.\nTwo other states, Virginia and Colorado, have passed their own comprehensive privacy laws to go into effect on January 1, 2023. Like the CCPA and CPRA, Virginia\u2019s Consumer Data Protection Act (\u201cCDPA\u201d) and the Colorado Privacy Act (\u201cCPA\u201d) regulates the collection, use and processing of personal information relating to Virginia and Colorado residents respectively, and grants certain privacy rights to those residents. The CDPA and CPA also have key differences, such as requiring affirmative consent before businesses may process sensitive personal information and requiring data protection assessments. Other states are expected to consider and potentially pass similar privacy laws in 2022.\nWe are also subject to international privacy laws and regulations, many of which, such as the General Data Privacy Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) and national laws implementing or supplementing the GDPR, such as the United Kingdom Data Protection Law 2018 (which retains key features of GDPR post-Brexit), are significantly more stringent than those currently enforced in the United States. The GDPR requires companies to meet requirements regarding the handling of personal data of individuals located in the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d). The GDPR imposes mandatory data breach notification requirements subject to a 72-hour notification deadline. The GDPR also includes significant penalties for noncompliance, which may result in monetary penalties of up to the higher of \u20ac20.0 million or 4% of a group\u2019s worldwide turnover for the preceding financial year for the most serious violations. The GDPR and other similar regulations require companies to give specific types of notice and informed consent is required for the placement of a cookie or similar technologies on a user\u2019s device for online tracking for behavioral advertising and other purposes and for direct electronic marketing, and the GDPR also imposes additional conditions in order to satisfy such consent, such as a prohibition on pre-checked tick boxes and bundled consents. Enforcement of the GDPR and related regulations varies by each EU Member State and is ongoing. Further laws and regulations on these topics are forthcoming, including the Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications (\u201cePrivacy Regulation\u201d), Digital Services Act (\u201cDSA\u201d), and Digital Markets Act (\u201cDMA\u201d). The GDPR may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process where that processing is subject to the GDPR. In addition, we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, including GDPR requirements as implemented by individual countries. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices.\nIn addition, under GDPR, transfers of personal data are prohibited to countries outside of the EEA that have not been determined by the European Commission to provide adequate protections for personal data, including the United States. There are mechanisms to permit the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States, but there is also uncertainty as to the future of such mechanisms, which have been under consistent scrutiny and challenge. In July 2020, decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, a means that previously permitted transfers of personal data from the EEA to companies in the United States that certified adherence to the Privacy Shield Framework. It is currently unclear what, if any, arrangement may replace the Privacy Shield Framework. Standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission to permit transfers from the EU to third countries currently remain as a basis on which to transfer personal data from the EEA to other countries. However, the standard contractual clauses are also subject to legal challenge, and in November 2020, the European Commission published a draft of updated standard contractual clauses. In January 2022, for example, Austria\u2019s data protection authority determined that the use of Google Analytics violated the GDPR and the Court of Justice of the European Union\u2019s \u201cSchrems II\u201d decision on international data transfers. We presently rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer personal data from EEA member countries, and we may be impacted by changes in law as a result of future review or invalidation of, or changes to, this mechanism by European courts or regulators. While we will continue to undertake efforts to conform to current regulatory obligations and evolving best practices, we may be unsuccessful in conforming to permitted means of transferring personal data from the European Economic Area. We may also experience hesitancy, reluctance, or refusal by European or multi-national customers to continue to use some of our services due to the potential risk exposure of personal data transfers and the current data protection\nobligations imposed on them by certain data protection authorities. Such customers may also view any alternative approaches to the transfer of any personal data as being too costly, too burdensome, or otherwise objectionable, and therefore may decide not to do business with us if the transfer of personal data is a necessary requirement.\nAlthough we take reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and have invested and continue to invest human and technology resources into data privacy compliance efforts, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory action, including fines, in the event of an incident or other claim. Data protection laws and requirements may also be enacted, interpreted or applied in a manner that creates inconsistent or contradictory requirements on companies that operate across jurisdictions. We or our third-party service providers could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our or our third-party service providers\u2019 business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our or our third-party service providers\u2019 business, results of operations or financial condition. For example, we may find it necessary to establish alternative systems to maintain personal data in the EEA, which may involve substantial expense and may cause us to divert resources from other aspects of our business, all of which may adversely affect our results from operations. Further, any inability to adequately address privacy concerns in connection with our solutions, or comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to us, and adversely affect our ability to offer our solutions. GDPR, CCPA, CPRA and other similar laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices. Our systems may not be able to satisfy these changing requirements and manufacturer, retailer and associate expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so.\nWe expect that new industry standards, laws and regulations will continue to be proposed regarding privacy, data protection and information security in many jurisdictions, including the European e-Privacy Regulation, which is currently in draft form, as well as at the U.S. federal and state levels. In addition, new data processes and datasets associated with emerging technologies are coming under increased regulatory scrutiny, such as biometrics and automated decision-making. We cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. Complying with these evolving obligations is challenging, time consuming and expensive, and federal regulators, state attorneys general and plaintiff\u2019s attorneys have been, and will likely continue to be, active in this space. Expanding definitions and interpretations of what constitutes \u201cpersonal data\u201d (or the equivalent) within the United States, the EEA and elsewhere may increase our compliance costs and legal liability. For example, various state privacy proposals have included a private right of action for basic privacy violations which, if passed, would dramatically increase both the legal costs of defending frivolous lawsuits and the penalties and costs associated with alleged violations.\nA data breach or any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any federal, state or foreign privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations or other principles or orders to which we may be subject or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection could adversely affect our reputation, brand and business, and may result in fines, enforcement actions, sanctions, claims (including claims for damages by affected individuals), investigations, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, or other penalties or liabilities or require us to change our operations and/or cease using certain data sets, among other negative consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, the proliferation of supply chain-based cyberattacks and vendor security incidents increases these potential risks and costs even in cases where the attack did not target us, occur on our systems, or result from any action or inaction by us. Depending on the nature of the information compromised, we may also have obligations to notify users, law enforcement, regulators, business partners or payment companies about the incident and provide some form of remedy, such as refunds or identity theft monitoring services, for the individuals affected by the incident.\nThe Take 5 Matter may lead to additional harms, risks and uncertainties for us, including litigation and governmental investigations, a reduction in revenue, a potential deterioration in our relationships or reputation and a loss in investor confidence.\nAs further described elsewhere in this Annual Report, we acquired the business of Take 5 Media Group in April 2018, and a result of an investigation into that business, we terminated all operations of the Take 5, including the use of its associated trade names and the offering of its services to its clients and offered refunds to clients of collected revenues attributable to the period after our acquisition. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Take 5 Matter\u201d and \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nAs a result of these matters, we may be subject to a number of additional harms, risks and uncertainties, including substantial costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement, potential lawsuits by clients or other interested parties who claim to have been harmed by the misconduct at Take 5, other costs and fees related to the Take 5 Matter (in excess of the amounts already being offered as refunds), potential governmental investigations arising from the Take 5 Matter, a reduction in our\ncurrent and anticipated revenue and a potential deterioration in our associate and client relationships or our reputation. In addition, if we do not prevail in any litigation or governmental investigation related to these matters, we could be subject to costs related to such litigation or governmental investigation, including equitable relief, civil monetary damages, treble damages, repayment or criminal penalties, which may not be covered by insurance or may materially increase our insurance costs. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional substantial defense and investigation costs regardless of the outcome of any such litigation or governmental investigation. In addition, there can be no assurance to what degree, if any, we will be able to recover any such costs or damages from the former owners of Take 5 or whether such former owners of Take 5 engaged in further unknown improper activities that may subject us to further costs or damages, including potential reputational harm. Likewise, such events have caused and may cause further diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention. Any adverse outcome related to these matters cannot be predicted at this time, and may materially harm our business, reputation, financial condition and/or results of operations, or the trading price of our securities.\nOur business is seasonal in nature and quarterly operating results can fluctuate.\nOur services are seasonal in nature, with the fourth fiscal quarter typically generating a higher proportion of our revenues than other fiscal quarters. Adverse events, such as deteriorating economic conditions, higher unemployment, higher gas prices, public transportation disruptions, public health crises (including the COVID-19 pandemic) or unanticipated adverse weather, could result in lower-than-planned sales during key revenue-producing seasons. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms, windstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for consumers to travel to retail stores or foodservice locations. Such events could lead to lower revenues, negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is competitive, and increased competition could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe sales, marketing and merchandising services industry is competitive. We face competition from a few other large, national or super-regional agencies as well as many niche and regional agencies. Remaining competitive in this industry requires that we closely monitor and respond to trends in all industry sectors. We cannot assure you that we will be able to anticipate and respond successfully to such trends in a timely manner. Moreover, some of our competitors may choose to sell services competitive to ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability or may be able to sell services competitive to ours at lower prices due to proprietary ownership of data or technical superiority, which could negatively impact the rates that we can charge. If we are unable to compete successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations. If certain competitors were to combine into integrated sales, marketing and merchandising services companies, additional sales, marketing and merchandising service companies were to enter the market or existing participants in this industry were to become more competitive, including through technological innovation such as social media and crowdsourcing, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDamage to our reputation could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reputation and the quality of our brand are critical to our business and success in existing markets and will be critical to our success as we enter new markets. We believe that we have built our reputation on the high quality of our sales and marketing services, our commitment to our clients and our performance-based culture, and we must protect and grow the value of our brand in order for us to continue to be successful. Any incident that erodes client loyalty to our brand could significantly reduce its value and damage our business. Also, there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices, including blogs, social media websites, Twitter and other forms of internet-based communications that provide individuals with access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. Information concerning us may be posted on such platforms at any time. Information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, each of which may harm our performance, prospects or business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\nWe rely on third parties to provide certain data and services in connection with the provision of our services.\nWe rely on third parties to provide certain data and services for use in connection with the provision of our services. For example, we contract with third parties to obtain the raw data on retail product sales and inventories. These suppliers of data may impose restrictions on our use of such data, fail to adhere to our quality control standards, increase the price they charge us for this data or refuse altogether to license the data to us. If we are unable to use such third-party data and services or if we are unable to contract with third parties, when necessary, our business, financial condition or our results of operations could be adversely affected. In the event that such data and services are unavailable for our use or the cost of acquiring such data and services increases, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to timely and effectively respond to changes in digital practices and policies, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges to practices and policies of operating systems, websites and other digital platforms, including, without limitation, Apple\u2019s or Android\u2019s transparency policies, may reduce the quantity and quality of the data and metrics that can be collected or used by us and our clients or reduce the value of our digital services. These limitations may adversely affect both our and our clients\u2019 ability to effectively target and measure the performance of our digital services. In addition, our clients and third party vendors routinely evaluate their digital practices and policies, and if in the future they determine to modify such practices and policies for any reasons, including, without limitation, privacy, targeting, age or content concerns, this could decrease the desire for our digital services as compared to other alternatives. If we are unable to timely or effectively respond to changes in digital practices and policies, or if our clients do not believe that our digital services will generate a competitive return on investment relative to alternatives, then our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which, in turn, could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trade names, service marks, trademarks, proprietary products and other intellectual property, including our name and logos. We rely on U.S. and foreign trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as license agreements, nondisclosure agreements and confidentiality and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. Nevertheless, these laws and procedures may not be adequate to prevent unauthorized parties from attempting to copy or otherwise obtain our processes and technology or deter our competitors from developing similar business solutions and concepts, and adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and other intellectual property.\nThe success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks to increase brand awareness and further develop our brand in both domestic and international markets. We have registered and applied to register our trade names, service marks and trademarks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. However, the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and in foreign countries may not be adequate, and third parties may misappropriate, dilute, infringe upon or otherwise harm the value of our intellectual property. If any of our registered or unregistered trademarks, trade names or service marks is challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks, it could have an adverse effect on our sales or market position. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions. This could make it difficult to stop the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions.\nWe rely upon trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. While it is our policy to enter into agreements imposing nondisclosure and confidentiality obligations upon our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, these obligations may be breached, may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, or adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized access, use or disclosure of our trade secrets and know-how. Furthermore, despite the existence of such nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, or other contractual restrictions, we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our confidential proprietary information or trade secrets by consultants, vendors and employees. In addition, others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other legal means.\nAny claims or litigation initiated by us to protect our proprietary technology could be time consuming, costly and divert the attention of our technical and management resources. If we choose to go to court to stop a third party from infringing our intellectual property, that third party may ask the court to rule that our intellectual property rights are invalid and/or should not be enforced against that third party. Even if the action that we take to protect our intellectual property rights is successful, any infringement may still have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights that are costly to defend, result in the diversion of management\u2019s time and efforts, require the payment of damages, limit our ability to use particular technologies in the future or prevent us from marketing our existing or future products and services.\nThird parties may assert that we infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their intellectual property, including with respect to our digital solutions and other technologies that are important to our business, and may sue us for intellectual property infringement. We may not be aware of whether our products or services do or will infringe existing or future patents or the intellectual property rights of others. In addition, there can be no assurance that one or more of our competitors who have developed competing technologies or our other competitors will not be granted patents for their technology and allege that we have infringed on such patents.\nAny claims that our business infringes the intellectual property rights of others, regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims, could incur substantial costs, and the time and attention of our management and other personnel may be diverted in pursuing these proceedings. An adverse determination in any intellectual property claim could require us to pay damages, be subject to an injunction, and/or stop using our technologies, trademarks, copyrighted works and other material found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights, and could prevent us from licensing our technologies to others unless we enter into royalty or licensing arrangements with the prevailing party or are able to redesign our products and services to avoid infringement. With respect to any third-party intellectual property that we use or wish to use in our business (whether or not asserted against us in litigation), we may not be able to enter into licensing or other arrangements with the owner of such intellectual property at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms. Any of the foregoing could harm our commercial success.\nWe are dependent on proprietary technology licensed from others. If we lose our licenses, we may not be able to continue developing our products.\nWe have obtained licenses that give us rights to third party intellectual property that is necessary or useful to our business. These license agreements may impose various royalty and other obligations on us. One or more of our licensors may allege that we have breached our license agreement with them, and could seek to terminate our license, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects. In addition, any claims brought against us by our licensors could be costly, time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nConsumer goods manufacturers and retailers, including some of our clients, are subject to extensive governmental regulation and we and they may be subject to enforcement in the event of noncompliance with applicable requirements.\nConsumer goods manufacturers and retailers, including some of our clients, are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations governing, among other things, the research, development, manufacture, distribution, marketing and post-market reporting of consumer products. These include laws administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d), the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities. For example, certain of our clients market and sell products containing cannabidiol (\u201cCBD\u201d). CBD products are subject to a number of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations restricting their use in certain categories of products and in certain jurisdictions. In particular, the FDA has publicly stated it is prohibited to sell into interstate commerce food, beverages or dietary supplements that contain CBD. These laws are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur costs associated with new or modified compliance requirements or require us or our clients to alter or limit our activities, including marketing and promotion, of such products, or to remove them from the market altogether.\nIf a regulatory authority determines that we or our current or future clients have not complied with the applicable regulatory requirements, our business may be materially impacted and we or our clients could be subject to enforcement actions or loss of business. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications of the laws, nor can we determine what effect additional laws, regulations or administrative policies and procedures, if and when enacted, promulgated and implemented, could have on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims for products for which we are the vendor of record or may otherwise be in the chain of title.\nFor certain of our clients\u2019 products, we become the vendor of record or otherwise may be in the chain of title. For these products, we could be subject to potential claims for misbranded, adulterated, contaminated, damaged or spoiled products, or could be subject to liability in connection with claims related to infringement of intellectual property, product liability, product recalls or other liabilities arising in connection with the sale or marketing of these products. As a result, we could be subject to claims or lawsuits (including potential class action lawsuits), and we could incur liabilities that are not insured or exceed our insurance coverage or for which the manufacturer of the product does not indemnify us. Even if product claims against us are not successful or fully pursued, these claims could be costly and time consuming and may require our management to spend time defending the claims rather than operating our business.\nA product that has been actually or allegedly misbranded, adulterated or damaged or is actually or allegedly defective could result in product withdrawals or recalls, destruction of product inventory, negative publicity and substantial costs of compliance or remediation. Any of these events, including a significant product liability judgment against us, could result in monetary damages and/or a loss of demand for our products, both of which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe generate revenues and incur expenses throughout the world that are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, and our results of operations may suffer due to currency translations.\nOur U.S. operations earn revenues and incur expenses primarily in U.S. dollars, while our international operations earn revenues and incur expenses primarily in Canadian dollars, British pounds or euros. Because of currency exchange rate fluctuations, including possible devaluations, we are subject to currency translation exposure on the results of our operations, in addition to economic exposure. There has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, especially between the U.S. dollar and the British pound. These risks could adversely impact our business or results of operations.\nFluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate and realization of our deferred tax assets may result in volatility of our operating results.\nWe are subject to taxes by the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities, and our tax liabilities will be affected by the allocation of expenses to differing jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which may include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions, and valuation allowances related to certain net deferred tax assets. At any one time, many tax years may be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these matters. We expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowance;\n\u2022tax effects of equity-based compensation;\n\u2022changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; or\n\u2022future earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by a variety of factors including but not limited to changes in the mix and level of earnings, varying tax rates in the different jurisdictions in which we operate, fluctuations in the valuation allowance, deductibility of certain items or changes to existing accounting rules or regulations. Further, tax legislation may be enacted in the future which could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates. We may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxing authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe are controlled by Topco, the Advantage Sponsors, and the CP Sponsor, whose economic and other interests in our business may be different from yours.\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 3,290,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and as of February 28, 2022, the Advantage Sponsors (as defined herein), Topco and Conyers Park II Sponsor LLC, an affiliate of Centerview Capital Management, LLC, which was Conyers Park\u2019s sponsor prior to the Merger (the \u201cCP Sponsor\u201d) collectively own 254,310,000 shares, or 79.94% (including 65.62% held by Topco), of our outstanding common stock. Subject to applicable law, the Advantage Sponsors, through their direct ownership of our common stock and their ownership of equity interests of Topco, and the CP Sponsor are able to exert significant influence in the election of our directors and control actions to be taken by our stockholders, including amendments to our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and approval of mergers, sales of substantially all of our assets, and other significant corporate transactions. It is possible that the interests of Topco, the Advantage Sponsors and the CP Sponsor may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders, including you.\nWe are a controlled company within the meaning of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC listing requirements and as a result, may rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. To the extent we rely on such exemptions, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such corporate governance requirements.\nBecause of the voting power over our company held by Topco, the Advantage Sponsors, and the CP Sponsor and the voting arrangement between such parties, we are considered a controlled company for the purposes of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) listing requirements. As such, we are exempt from the corporate governance requirements that our board of directors, compensation committee, and nominating and corporate governance committee meet the standard of independence established by those corporate governance requirements. The independence standards are intended to ensure that directors who meet the independence standards are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors.\nWe do not currently utilize the exemptions afforded to a controlled company, though we are entitled to do so. To the extent we utilize these exemptions, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq.\nThe anti-takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prevent or delay a change in control of us, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control of us, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. These include:\n\u2022authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022provision for a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022not permitting the use of cumulative voting for the election of directors;\n\u2022permitting the removal of directors only for cause;\n\u2022limiting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022requiring approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend, or repeal the proposed bylaws or repeal the provisions of the third amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors; and\n\u2022establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, although we have opted out of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), our certificate of incorporation contain similar provisions providing that we may not engage in certain \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d with any \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a three-year period following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, subject to certain exceptions. Generally, a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d includes a merger, asset, or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder.\nSubject to certain exceptions, an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is a person who, together with that person\u2019s affiliates and associates, owns, or within the previous three years owned, 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock.\nUnder certain circumstances, this provision will make it more difficult for a person who would be an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to effect various business combinations with us for a three-year period. These provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our board of directors and may make it more difficult to accomplish transactions which stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests.\nMoreover, our certificate of incorporation provides that Topco and its affiliates do not constitute \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d for purposes of this provision, and thus any business combination transaction between us and Topco and its affiliates would not be subject to the protections otherwise provided by this provision. Topco and its affiliates are not prohibited from selling a controlling interest in us to a third party and may do so without your approval and without providing for a purchase of your shares of common stock, subject to the lock-up restrictions applicable to Topco. Accordingly, your shares of common stock may be worth less than they would be if Topco and its affiliates did not maintain voting control over us.\nThe provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws requiring exclusive venue in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware or the federal district courts of the United States of America for certain types of lawsuits may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws require, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine will have to be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (or the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware if the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware does not have jurisdiction).\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws also require that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act; however, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provision, and investors cannot waive compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Although we believe these provisions benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of applicable law in the types of lawsuits to which they apply, the provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. These provisions do not apply to any suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts of the United States have exclusive jurisdiction.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on our Class A common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. The payment of cash dividends is also restricted under the terms of the agreements governing our debt and our ability to pay dividend may also be restricted by the terms of any future credit agreement or any securities we or our subsidiaries may issue.\nAn active, liquid trading market for our Class A common stock may not be available.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our company will lead to availability of a trading market on Nasdaq or otherwise in the future or how active and liquid that market may be for our Class A common stock. If an active and liquid trading market is not available, you may have difficulty selling any of our Class A common stock. Among other things, in the absence of a liquid public trading market:\n\u2022you may not be able to liquidate your investment in shares of Class A common stock;\n\u2022you may not be able to resell your shares of Class A common stock at or above the price attributed to them in the Transactions;\n\u2022the market price of shares of Class A common stock may experience significant price volatility; and\n\u2022there may be less efficiency in carrying out your purchase and sale orders.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe market prices for our Class A common stock are likely to be volatile and may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:\n\u2022quarterly variations in our operating results compared to market expectations;\n\u2022changes in preferences of our clients;\n\u2022announcements of new products or services or significant price reductions;\n\u2022the size of our public float;\n\u2022fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes;\n\u2022defaults on our indebtedness;\n\u2022changes in senior management or key personnel;\n\u2022the granting, vesting, or exercise of employee stock options, restricted stock, or other equity rights;\n\u2022the payment of any dividends thereon in shares of our common stock;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022negative earnings or other announcements by us;\n\u2022downgrades in our credit ratings;\n\u2022material litigation or governmental investigations;\n\u2022issuances of capital stock;\n\u2022global economic, legal, and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance, including the COVID-19 pandemic; or\n\u2022the realization of any risks described in this Annual Report under \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nIn addition, in the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation against companies following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nWe cannot provide any guaranty that we will continue to repurchase our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program.\nIn November 2021, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to $100 million of our outstanding Class A common stock (the \u201c2021 Share Repurchase Program\u201d). As of December 31, 2021, the remaining amount available for repurchase pursuant to the 2021 Share Repurchase Program is $87.4 million. However, we are not obligated to make any further purchases under the 2021 Share Repurchase Program and we may suspend or permanently discontinue this program at any time or significantly reduce the amount of repurchases under the program. Any announcement of a suspension, discontinuance or reduction of this program may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence.\nThe valuation of our private placement warrants could increase the volatility in our net income (loss) in our consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\nThe change in fair value of our private placement warrants is determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The change in fair value of warrant liability represents the mark-to-market fair value adjustments to the outstanding private placement warrants issued in connection with the initial public offering of Conyers Park. Significant changes in the input assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model including our stock price at the end of the reporting period, the implied volatility or other inputs to the model and the number of private placement warrants outstanding may adversely affect the volatility in our net income (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nRisks Related to Indebtedness\nWe need to continue to generate significant operating cash flow in order to fund acquisitions and to service our debt.\nOur business currently generates operating cash flow, which we use to fund acquisitions to grow our business and to service our substantial indebtedness. If, because of loss of revenue, pressure on pricing from customers, increases in our costs (including increases in costs related to servicing our indebtedness or labor costs), general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory conditions or other factors, including any acceleration of the foregoing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which are outside of our control our business generates less operating cash flow, we may not have sufficient funds to grow our business or to service our indebtedness.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the lenders under our credit facilities could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders under our credit agreements to avoid being in default. If we or any of our subsidiaries breach the covenants under our credit agreements and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under our credit agreements, the lenders could exercise their rights as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health, restrict our activities, and affect our ability to meet our obligations.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, we had total indebtedness of $2.1 billion, excluding debt issuance costs, with an additional $54.8 million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility. The agreements governing our indebtedness contain customary covenants that restrict us from taking certain actions, such as incurring additional debt, permitting liens on pledged assets, making investments, paying dividends or making distributions to equity holders, prepaying junior debt, engaging in mergers or restructurings, and selling assets, among other things, which may restrict our ability to successfully execute on our business plan. For a more detailed description of the covenants and material terms of our material indebtedness, please see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in this Annual Report.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur additional indebtedness, which could increase the risks associated with our indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future because the terms of our indebtedness do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so. Subject to covenant compliance and certain conditions, as of December 31, 2021, the agreements governing our indebtedness would have permitted us to borrow up to an additional $345.2 million under our revolving credit facility. In addition, we and our subsidiaries have, and will have, the ability to incur additional indebtedness as incremental facilities under our credit agreement and we or our subsidiaries may issue additional notes in the future. If additional debt is added to our current debt levels and our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the related risks that we and they now face could increase.\nFailure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, ability to hedge certain financial risks, borrowing costs, and access to capital markets.\nOur credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies, and such agencies have in the past downgraded, and could in the future downgrade, our ratings. Our credit rating may impact the interest rates on any future indebtedness as well as the applicability of certain covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and any additional, actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position, ability to hedge certain financial risks, and access to capital markets.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. On a pro forma basis, assuming no other prepayments of the credit facility and that our revolving credit facility is fully drawn (and to the extent that LIBOR is in excess of the 0.00% and 0.75% floors applicable to our revolving credit facility and our term loan credit facility, respectively), each one-eighth percentage point change in interest rates would result in an approximately $1.3 million change in annual interest expense on the indebtedness under our credit facilities. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating- for fixed-rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility or risk. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to any of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully or effectively mitigate our interest rate risk.\nWe are subject to risks related to recent proposals for reform regarding LIBOR.\nCertain of our financial arrangements, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities were made at variable rates that use the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR (or metrics derived from or related to LIBOR), as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. However, in November 2020, the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, announced that it intends to extend the cessation date for most LIBOR tenors to June 30, 2023. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the \u201cARRC\u201d) of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. On July 29, 2021, the ARRC formally recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative to LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. However, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the nature of potential changes to and future utilization of specific LIBOR tenors, the development and acceptance of alternative reference rates, and other reforms. These consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us. Changes in market interest rates may influence our financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce our earnings and cash flows.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur business and financial results may be affected by various litigation and regulatory proceedings.\nWe are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future. These proceedings have included, and in the future may include, matters involving personnel and employment issues, workers\u2019 compensation, personal and property injury, disputes relating to acquisitions (including contingent consideration), governmental investigations and other proceedings. Some historical and current legal proceedings and future legal proceedings may\npurport to be brought as class actions or representative basis on behalf of similarly situated parties including with respect to employment-related matters. We cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of any such claims, and resolution of these types of matters against us may result in significant fines, judgments or settlements, which, if uninsured, or if the fines, judgments and settlements exceed insured levels, could adversely affect our business or financial results. See \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nWe are subject to many federal, state, local and international laws with which compliance is both costly and complex.\nOur business is subject to various, and sometimes complex, laws and regulations, including those that have been or may be implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state, local and international governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. These costs could have an adverse impact on our business or results of operations. Moreover, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could lead to fines, penalties or management distraction or otherwise harm our business.\nOur insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims.\nWe believe that we maintain insurance customary for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. Further, insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, and, if available, coverage may not be adequate. If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms, we could be exposed to significant losses.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a public company.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, insurance, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules implemented by the SEC. The expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes generally have been increasing. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. In estimating these costs, we took into account expenses related to insurance, legal, accounting, and compliance activities, as well as other expenses not currently incurred. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on our board committees, or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our Class A common stock, fines, sanctions, and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nOur management has limited experience in operating a public company.\nOur executive officers have limited experience in the management of a publicly traded company. Our management team may not successfully or effectively manage our transition to a public company that will be subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under federal securities laws. Their limited experience in dealing with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies could be a significant disadvantage in that it is likely that an increasing amount of their time may be devoted to these activities which will result in less time being devoted to the management and growth of the Company. We may not have adequate personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience, and training in the accounting policies, practices or internal control over financial reporting required of public companies in the United States. The development and implementation of the standards and controls necessary for the Company to achieve the level of accounting standards required of a public company in the United States may require costs greater than expected. It is possible that we will be required to expand our employee base and hire additional employees to support our operations as a public company which will increase our operating costs in future periods.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our common stock, the price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If few analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price of our stock could be negatively affected. Even with analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of\nour Class A common stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our common stock, we could lose visibility in the market for our Class A common stock, which in turn could cause our Class A common stock price to decline.\nSubstantial future sales of our Class A common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares. Certain shares of our common stock are freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for any shares of our common stock that may be held or acquired by our directors, executive officers, and other affiliates, as that term is defined in the Securities Act, which are to be restricted securities under the Securities Act. Restricted securities may not be sold in the public market unless the sale is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available. Topco, the Advantage Sponsors, the CP Sponsor and members of our management have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering Topco\u2019s shares of our common stock or to include shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. In each of November 2019 and March 2021, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 under which certain of our shareholders may sell, from time to time, 50,000,000 shares and 255,465,000 shares of our Class A common stock, respectively, that, if sold, will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. In the event a large number of shares of Class A common stock are sold in the public market, such sales could reduce the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may also issue shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in ownership dilution to you as a stockholder and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 18953, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "CPAA"}
