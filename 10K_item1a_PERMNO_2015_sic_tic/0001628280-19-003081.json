{"cik": "350403", "company": "PHI INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of \u201crisk factors\u201d identifies the most significant risks or uncertainties that could (i) materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects or (ii) cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations. You should carefully consider these factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this report, when evaluating our business and whether to purchase, sell or hold our securities. Please note that the following discussion is not intended to comprehensively list all risks or uncertainties faced by us. Our operations or actual results\ncould also be similarly impacted by additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us, that we currently deem to be immaterial, or that are not specific to us or our industry, such as general economic conditions.\nRisks Relating to Chapter 11 Cases\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 Cases.\nOn March 14, 2019 (the \u201cPetition Date\u201d), the Company and its principal U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cDebtors\u201d) filed voluntary petitions (the \u201cChapter 11 Cases\u201d) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (the \u201cBankruptcy Court\u201d) seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the \u201cBankruptcy Code\u201d).\nFor the duration of our Chapter 11 Cases, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and ability to continue as a going concern, are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These risks include the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, confirm, consummate and implement a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain court approval of motions filed by us in Chapter 11 Cases from time to time;\n\u2022\nthe high costs of bankruptcy proceedings and related fees;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, represented employees, non-represented employees and other third parties;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, motivate and retain key employees;\n\u2022\nthe significant time and effort required to be spent by senior management in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and restructuring activities rather than focusing exclusively on business operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations on reasonably acceptable terms and conditions;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and execute our business plan and strategies;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain acceptable and appropriate future financing to the extent required;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate contracts and other agreements with us;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for us to propose and confirm a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee, to convert the Chapter 11 Cases to a Chapter 7 proceeding or to take other actions opposed by management; and\n\u2022\nthe actions and decisions of our creditors and other third parties who have interests in our Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with our plans.\nFurthermore, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of the Chapter 11 Cases on our various stakeholders and constituents. Even if a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is approved and implemented, our operating results may be adversely affected by the possible reluctance of third parties to do business with a company that recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases will have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or stakeholders, nor can we assure you of our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur businesses could suffer from a long and protracted restructuring.\nOur future results are dependent upon the timely and successful filing, confirmation and implementation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization. No assurance can be provided as to the length of time during which the Chapter 11 Cases will be pending. A long period of operations under Bankruptcy Court protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nSo long as the Chapter 11 Cases continue, our senior management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on our business operations. A prolonged period of operating under Bankruptcy Court protection also may make it more difficult to retain management and other key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. Further, the longer the Chapter 11 Cases continue, the more likely it is that our customers and suppliers will lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully and will seek to establish alternative commercial relationships.\nAdditionally, so long as the Chapter 11 Cases continue, we will be required to incur substantial costs for professional fees and other expenses associated with the administration of the Chapter 11 Cases. We have engaged the services of financial consultants and legal advisors for our Chapter 11 proceedings. In addition, pursuant to certain agreements, court orders, and applicable Chapter 11 law, we are required to pay for the services of financial consultants and legal advisors for certain of our creditors. These services are expensive and may impact our ability to restructure our organization.\nOperating under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nWhile we operate our businesses as a debtor-in-possession, we are required to obtain the approval of the Bankruptcy Court prior to engaging in activities or transactions outside the ordinary course of business. We must obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to, among other things:\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions outside the ordinary course of business\u037e\n\u2022\nbuy or sell assets or make capital investments outside the ordinary course of business\u037e\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets\u037e\n\u2022\ngrant liens; and\n\u2022\nborrow funds for our operations, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our best interest.\nBankruptcy Court approval of non-ordinary course activities entails preparation and filing of appropriate motions with the Bankruptcy Court and one or more hearings. Various third parties may raise objections with respect to these motions. This process may delay certain activities. Furthermore, in the event the Bankruptcy Court does not approve a proposed activity or transaction, we would be prevented from engaging in that activity or transaction.\nIn certain instances, any of the Chapter 11 Cases could be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, which we believe could result in significant smaller distributions to the Debtors' creditors than under a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization.\nIn order to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, we must develop and obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization by the Bankruptcy Court. The confirmation process can be subject to numerous, unanticipated potential delays. There can be no assurance that we will be able to confirm a plan of reorganization, so we urge caution with respect to existing and future investments in our securities.\nWe believe it is likely that we will receive objections to confirmation of any plan of reorganization from various stakeholders in the Chapter 11 proceedings. We cannot predict the impact that any objection to the plan or any third party motion filed during the Chapter 11 proceedings may have on a Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision to confirm a plan of reorganization or our ability to successfully implement a plan of reorganization.\nIf a plan of reorganization is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court the impact on our business and stakeholders is not clear.\nIf no plan of reorganization can be confirmed or if the Bankruptcy Court finds it appropriate to do so, the Bankruptcy Court may convert our Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases to cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate the Debtors' assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code.\nOur financial results may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends.\nDuring the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as asset impairments, asset dispositions, restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments could significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not indicative of our financial performance after the Petition Date.\nIn addition, if we emerge from Chapter 11 as anticipated, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may materially change relative to historical consolidated financial statements, including as a result of revisions to our operating plans pursuant to a plan of reorganization. We also may be required to adopt fresh start accounting, in which case our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date, which may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Accordingly, if fresh-start accounting rules apply, our financial condition and results of operations following emergence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results reflected in our historical financial statements.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Cases, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation. However, certain exceptions could apply. Any claims not ultimately discharged through\nthe Chapter 11 plan of reorganization could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on a post-reorganization basis.\nWe may experience increased levels of employee attrition as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we may experience increased levels of employee attrition, and our employees likely will face considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incentivize key employees to remain with us through the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases may be limited by restrictions on implementation of incentive and retention programs under the Bankruptcy Code. The competition for experienced personnel in our industry can be intense. The loss of services of members of our senior management team could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur senior management team and other key personnel may not be able to execute the business plans as currently developed, given the substantial attention required of such individuals by the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThe execution of our business plans is materially dependent on the efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel. It is impossible to predict with certainty the amount of time that we could spend in bankruptcy or to assure parties in interest that a plan of reorganization will be confirmed. The Chapter 11 proceedings may involve additional expense and our management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort focusing on the proceedings. This diversion of attention may materially adversely affect the conduct of our business, the ability of our senior management to execute our business plans and, as a result, our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the Chapter 11 proceedings are protracted. Accordingly, our business plan may not be implemented as anticipated, which may cause its financial results to materially deviate from those currently anticipated.\nWe could be materially adversely affected if our exclusivity period lapses or is terminated.\nAt the outset of a Chapter 11 proceeding, the Bankruptcy Code gives the debtor the exclusive right to propose a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization and prohibits creditors, equity security holders and others from proposing a plan. We currently expect to retain the exclusive right to propose a plan of reorganization with respect to the Chapter 11 Cases. However, if the Bankruptcy Court terminates that right or the exclusivity period expires, our ability to achieve confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization could be materially adversely affected.\nAny Chapter 11 plan of reorganization that we may implement will be based in large part upon assumptions and analysis developed by us. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, our plan may be unsuccessful in its execution.\nAny plan of reorganization we may implement could affect our capital structure and the ownership, structure and operation of our business and will reflect assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we consider appropriate under the circumstances. Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with our expectations and assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to: (i) our ability to change substantially our capital structure, (ii) our continued ability to obtain adequate liquidity and access financing sources, (iii) our ability to maintain customers\u2019 confidence in our viability as a continuing entity and to attract and retain sufficient business from them, (iv) our ability to retain key employees and (v) the overall strength and stability of the markets in which we operate, both domestic and international. The failure of any of these factors could materially adversely affect the successful reorganization of our business.\nIn addition, any Chapter 11 plan of reorganization will rely upon financial projections, including with respect to revenues, capital expenditures, debt service and cash flow. Financial forecasts are necessarily speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be accurate. In our case, the forecasts will be even more speculative than normal, because they may involve fundamental changes in the nature of our capital structure. Accordingly, we expect that our actual financial condition and results of operations will differ, perhaps materially, from what we have anticipated. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by any plan of reorganization we may implement will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on us and our subsidiaries or our business or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could materially adversely affect the successful execution of any plan of reorganization.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted by the loss of customers and suppliers.\nDifficulties of operating while attempting to reorganize our businesses in bankruptcy may make it more difficult to maintain and promote our services and attract customers to our services and to keep our suppliers. As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we may experience collection issues with otherwise valid receivables of certain customers. Adverse resolution of these disagreements may impact our revenues and other costs of services, both prospectively and retroactively. It is too soon for us to predict with any certainty the ultimate impact of any such disagreements. Vendors may be less willing to conduct business with us on customary trade terms during the pendency of our Chapter 11 Cases and, in some instances, could decline to do business with us altogether. Many of our suppliers, vendors and service providers may require stricter terms and conditions, and we may not find these terms and conditions acceptable.\nTrading in our equity securities during the pendency of our Chapter 11 Cases poses substantial risks and is highly speculative.\nBased on current information, we believe it is possible that all or most of the value of our equity securities will be extinguished in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, and that the holders thereof would not be entitled to receive, and would not receive or retain, any property or interest in property on account of such equity interests. In such event, amounts invested by the holders of such securities would not be recoverable and such securities would have no value.\nTrading prices for our equity or other securities may bear little or no relationship during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases to the actual recovery, if any, by the holders thereof at the conclusion of the Chapter 11 Cases. Trading in the company\u2019s securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. Accordingly, we urge extreme caution with respect to existing and future investments in our equity or other securities.\nWe anticipate that the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases could detrimentally affect the trading liquidity of our common stock.\nOn March 15, 2019, Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d), on which our common stock is currently listed, notified us of its determination to delist our common stock from Nasdaq under its applicable rules. We have the right to appeal this determination, but have not yet made a determination of whether to do so. If we do not appeal, we expect that our common stock will be delisted on March 26, 2019. If so, our common stock may become available for trading in alternative markets. However, we can neither assure you of this nor whether such alternative markets will provide sufficient trading liquidity, if any.\nSecurities traded on alternative markets generally have significantly less liquidity than securities traded on a national securities exchange due to factors such as the reduced number of (i) investors that will consider investing in the securities, (ii) market makers in the securities, and (iii) securities analysts that follow such securities. As a result, holders of shares of our common stock may find it difficult to resell their shares at prices quoted in the market or at all.\nFurthermore, because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in our common stock that could occur, the share price of our common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the markets perception of our business, and announcements made by us, our competitors, parties with whom we have business relationships or third parties with interests in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThe delisting of our common stock could impair our ability to incentivize key personnel through equity-based compensation or to use our equity for other strategic purposes. A number of institutional investors have investment policies that prohibit them from trading in securities listed on an over-the-counter market. Similarly, many brokers may be restricted from recommending over-the-counter securities to their customers due to their firm\u2019s trading policies or applicable regulations of self-regulatory agencies. As a result, investors may find it less convenient to sell, or to obtain accurate quotations in seeking to buy, our common stock on an over-the-counter market, which would significantly limit the liquidity of our capital stock and may adversely affect the demand for and market price of our capital stock.\nThe lack of liquidity in our common stock may also make it difficult for us to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or to otherwise arrange for any financing we may need in the future. For these and other reasons, we urge that extreme caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur substantial indebtedness and operating lease commitments could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business.\nWe currently have substantial obligations under finance agreements and operating leases, and expect this will continue to be the case even if we successfully emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our total senior indebtedness was $630 million, consisting of (i) $500.0 million principal amount of our 5.25% Senior Notes due March 15, 2019 and (ii) $130.0 million principal amount of borrowings under our two-year term loan\nwith the financing affiliate of our controlling shareholder (in each case excluding debt issuance costs). We also had $19.8 million of letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $159.5 million of aggregate lease commitments. As discussed further elsewhere herein, we borrowed an additional $70 million on March 13, 2019.\nThe commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default that accelerated the obligations under the following instruments and agreements:\n\u2022\nThe Indenture dated as of March 17, 2014, as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, by and among the Company, as issuer, the guarantors' party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association as trustee, and the Company\u2019s $500 million aggregate principal amount of our above-described senior notes issued thereunder.\n\u2022\nThe Loan Agreement, dated as of September 28, 2018, as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, by and among Thirty Two, L.L.C., as lender, the Company, as borrower and the guarantors party thereto, and the related Promissory Note dated as of September 28, 2018 by the Company, as borrower, in favor of Thirty Two, L.L.C., as lender, for the above-described $130 million term loan.\nThe instruments and agreements described above provide that as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the financial obligations thereunder, including any principal amount, together with accrued interest thereon, will be immediately due and payable. Any efforts to enforce payment of such financial obligations under such instruments and agreements are automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases and the holders\u2019 rights of enforcement in respect of such financial obligations are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\nFor additional information on our indebtedness and commitments, please see Items 7 and 8 of this report.\nThe degree to which we are leveraged or may become leveraged in the future could have important consequences to our equity and debt holders, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to access the capital markets, particularly if, as discussed further in the risk factor disclosure below, (i) the ratings assigned to our debt securities by nationally recognized credit rating organizations are revised downward, (ii) potential creditors are unwilling to extend credit to us on reasonable terms or at all, or (iii) we seek capital during periods of turbulent or unsettled market conditions;\n\u2022\nhindering our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to plan for or react to changing market, industry, competitive or economic conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting the amount of cash flow available for use in the business, including for working capital, capital expenditures, aircraft purchases, future operations, acquisitions, expansion or other uses, or to carry out other aspects of our business plan;\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns, including interest rate increases;\n\u2022\nincreasing our future borrowing costs;\n\u2022\nincreasing the risk that third parties will be unwilling or unable to engage in hedging or other financial or commercial arrangements with us;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors;\n\u2022\nincreasing the risk that we will need to sell securities or assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations; or\n\u2022\nincreasing the risk that we may not meet the financial covenants contained in our debt or lease agreements or timely make all required debt or lease payments, either of which could result in the acceleration of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness.\nSubject to the limits contained in our existing debt and lease instruments and under the Bankruptcy Code, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time. If we do so, the effects of each of these factors could be intensified.\nOur business requires us to incur substantial capital expenditures.\nOur business is capital intensive, and we anticipate that our capital requirements will continue to be significant in the future. Our capital expenditures relate primarily to the purchase of aircraft, including purchases of aircraft under purchase options, as well as capital improvements that enhance the value or safety of our aircraft and related infrastructure or that are necessitated by changes in technology or customer preferences. At December 31, 2018, we did not have any commitment to purchase aircrafts in 2019. If we fail to adequately invest in our aircraft and related infrastructure in the future, the competitiveness of our fleet and service offerings could suffer.\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations and other commitments will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors, many of which we are unable to control.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and under our operating leases and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to conditions in the oil and gas and air medical industries, general economic and financial conditions, the impact of legislative and regulatory actions on how we conduct our business, and several other factors, all or most of which are beyond our control. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt and operating lease obligations, or to obtain alternative financings, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFailure to comply with covenants in our future financing arrangements could adversely affect our business and ability to operate as a going concern.\nAlthough the terms of our future financing arrangements are unclear, we expect that they will contain negative covenants that may materially restrict our operations. Similarly, we expect that our future financing arrangements may contain financial covenants the same or similar to those contained in our Term Loan Agreement, dated March 13, 2019. Our ability to meet certain of these covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet them in the future. Any such failure to meet such covenants would constitute an event of default, which could potentially result in additional defaults or the acceleration of payment obligations under cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in other of our agreements. We may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by these restrictive covenants. These restrictions could also limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a downturn in our business or the economy in general, or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities.\nRisks Inherent in our Industry\nIf we fail to maintain our safety record, our ability to attract and retain customers could be seriously harmed.\nA favorable safety record is one of the primary factors a customer reviews in selecting an aviation provider. If we fail to maintain our safety and reliability record, our ability to attract new customers and maintain our current customers could be materially adversely affected.\nHelicopter operations are inherently risky, and our insurance may be insufficient to cover our losses.\nThe operation of helicopters inherently involves a high degree of risk. Aircraft accidents, collisions, fire, adverse weather, and other hazards may result in loss of life, serious injury to employees and third parties, damages to equipment or property owned by us or others, loss of revenues, termination of customer contracts, fines, penalties, restrictions on conducting business, increased insurance costs, or damage to our reputation or customer relationships. Accidents involving other helicopter companies could adversely impact us if they (i) cause governmental agencies to impose flight moratoriums or (ii) reduce demand for the specific model of helicopter involved in the accidents or for helicopter services generally.\nWe maintain hull and liability insurance on our aircraft, which insures us against physical loss of, or damage, to our aircraft and against certain legal liabilities to others. In addition, we carry war risk, expropriation, confiscation and nationalization insurance for our aircraft involved in international operations. We do not, however, carry insurance against all types of losses. For instance, we are not insured for loss of use of our aircraft, business interruption, or loss of flight hours.\nWhile we believe that our insurance and indemnification arrangements provide reasonable protection for a substantial portion of our foreseeable losses, they are subject to deductibles, retentions, coverage limits, and coverage exceptions, the aggregate impact of which could be material. Accordingly, our incurrence of severe casualty losses, the expropriation or confiscation of significant assets, or other events that are not partially or fully covered by insurance could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, access to affordable insurance, or cash flows.\nWe furnish to and receive from our customers indemnities relating to damages caused or sustained by us in connection with our operations. Our customers\u2019 changing views on risk allocation could cause us to accept greater risk to win new business or could result in us losing business if we are not prepared to take such risks. To the extent that we accept such additional risk, and seek to insure against it, our insurance premiums could rise.\nNegative publicity may adversely impact us.\nAdverse publicity or news coverage relating to us, including, publicity or news coverage in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, may negatively impact our efforts to establish and promote name recognition and a positive image after emergence from\nthe Chapter 11 Cases. In addition, accidents involving any aircraft operated by us or another operator could cause substantial adverse publicity affecting us specifically or our industry generally. In either case, media coverage and public statements that insinuate improper actions by us or other industry participants, regardless of their factual accuracy or truthfulness, may result in negative publicity, litigation, governmental investigations, or additional regulation. Various consumer interest groups have questioned the fairness of certain billing practices used in the air medical industry, which has generated negative industry publicity and various proposals to further regulate the industry. Addressing negative publicity and any resulting litigation, investigations or regulation may distract management, increase costs, and divert resources. Negative publicity may have an adverse impact on our reputation and the morale of our employees, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Our aircraft have been involved in accidents in the past, some of which have included the loss of life and property damages. We may experience similar accidents in the future.\nOur operations are affected by adverse weather conditions and seasonal factors.\nWe are subject to weather-related or seasonal factors, including primarily:\n\u2022\npoor weather conditions that often prevail during winter but can develop in any season;\n\u2022\nhurricanes, typhoons, cyclones or other tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico or our other tropical or sub-tropical markets; and\n\u2022\nreduced daylight hours during the winter months.\nPoor visibility, high winds and heavy precipitation can affect the operation of helicopters and significantly reduce our flight hours. A significant portion of our operating revenue is dependent on actual flight hours and a substantial portion of our direct costs is fixed. Thus, prolonged periods of adverse weather can materially and adversely affect our operating revenues and net earnings.\nIn most of our markets, the winter months generally have more days of adverse weather conditions than the other months of the year. Also, during the summer tropical storm season, we are unable to operate in the area of the storm and can incur significant expense in moving our aircraft to safer locations. In addition, as many of our offshore bases are located along coastal areas, hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones and other tropical storms may cause substantial damage to our property, including helicopters that we are unable to relocate.\nBecause the fall and winter months have fewer hours of daylight, our flight hours are generally lower at those times, which typically results in a reduction in operating revenues during those months. Currently, approximately 59% of the helicopters used in our Oil and Gas operations are equipped to fly under instrument flight rules (\u201cIFR\u201d), which enables these aircraft, when manned by IFR-rated pilots and co-pilots, to operate when poor visibility or darkness prevents flight by non-IFR aircraft.\nRecently, our Air Medical operations have been negatively impacted by a greater-than-anticipated number of days where adverse weather grounded flights. Some industry observers have speculated that changes in weather patterns have caused this situation, and that such adverse weather patterns could persist in the future. If those speculations prove to be true, our Air Medical segment will continue to be adversely affected thereby.\nOur helicopters may not always be profitably deployed.\nOur helicopters may not always be profitably deployed. Customers often require a specific type of helicopter, which may be different from those in our fleet. The duration of our typical customer contract is generally too short to recover our full cost of purchasing a helicopter, subjecting us to the risk that we will be unable to recoup our investment in the helicopter. Helicopters we acquire may not be covered by customer contracts when they are added to our fleet. Once a new helicopter is delivered to us, we generally spend between two and three months installing mission-specific or customer-specific equipment before we place it into service. As a result, there can be a significant delay between the delivery date for a new helicopter and the time that it is able to generate revenues for us. In addition, unscheduled maintenance or repairs can interrupt our service and adversely impact our operating results.\nAs discussed in greater detail elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the downturn in the oil and gas industry that began in mid-2014 significantly reduced the demand for and utilization of our fleet of offshore aircraft in the ensuing years.\nMoreover, we typically incur substantial fixed costs on our aircraft (including insurance, maintenance, crew wages and benefits, and lease costs, if applicable), regardless of whether they are operating. Accordingly, our inability to deploy aircraft has a substantial detrimental impact on the profitability of our operations.\nThe market for the sale of used aircraft is limited and volatile.\nIf we cannot find an acceptably profitable use for a helicopter, or if a helicopter no longer meets our strategic objectives, including due to age, we will frequently seek to sell it. Prices in the used helicopter market have been volatile over time, and we may incur gains or losses from the sale of helicopters. The number of aircraft sales and the amount of gains and losses recorded on these sales depends on a wide variety of factors, and is inherently unpredictable. Moreover, there may be limited or no demand for certain types of used aircraft, especially older medium or heavy helicopters. Recently, the demand for various types of used aircraft has diminished. Our inability to dispose of our aircraft in the secondary markets on acceptable terms or at all may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flow.\nOur contracts generally can be terminated or downsized by our customers without penalty.\nMost of our fixed-term contracts contain provisions permitting early termination by the customer, sometimes with as little as 30 days\u2019 notice for any reason and generally without penalty. In addition, many of our contracts permit our customers to decrease the number of aircraft under contract with a corresponding decrease in the fixed monthly payments without penalty. In light of weak offshore market conditions, certain of our customers over the past few years have requested reductions in the number of aircraft under contract, pricing concessions or both, and we may receive additional such requests in the future. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on the existence or current terms of our customer contracts.\nThe helicopter services business is competitive.\nAll segments of our business are highly competitive. We generally compete on the basis of safety, price, reliability, aircraft availability, experience, fleet configuration and quality of service.\nWe have two major competitors and several small competitors operating in the Gulf of Mexico, including leasing companies. We believe competition in our international offshore markets is as great as or greater than the competition we face in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, most of our customers and potential customers could operate their own helicopter fleets if they chose to do so.\nOur Air Medical segment competes for business primarily under the independent provider model and, to a lesser extent, under the traditional provider model. Under the independent provider model, we have no contracts and no fixed revenue stream, but must compete for transport referrals on a daily basis with other independent operators in the area. Under the traditional provider model, we contract directly with healthcare facilities to provide their transportation services, with the contracts typically awarded on a competitive bid basis. Under both models, we compete against national and regional companies, and there is usually more than one competitor in each local market. In addition, we compete against hospitals that operate their own helicopters. Demand for our Air Medical flight services would decrease if more hospitals in our operating areas develop their own aviation capability. Over the past several years, we believe the number of air medical helicopters operating in the U.S. has increased, thereby intensifying competitive pressures.\nWe depend on our ability to qualify as an eligible bidder under contract criteria and to compete successfully against other qualified bidders in order to obtain certain of our contracts.\nCertain of our customers in each of our segments conduct competitive processes for awarding certain contracts pursued by us. We typically face strong competition and pricing pressures for competitively bid contract awards, and we may be required to qualify or continue to qualify under applicable contract criteria. Our inability to qualify as an eligible bidder under contract criteria could preclude us from competing for certain contract awards. In addition, our inability to qualify as an eligible bidder, or to compete successfully when bidding for certain contracts and to win those contracts, could materially adversely affect us.\nOur customers might be able to obtain services comparable to ours through other forms of transportation.\nIn certain markets worldwide, oil and gas companies have elected to transport personnel and equipment to and from their offshore rigs and platforms through the use of marine transportation vessels, especially when such rigs and platforms are located close to shore. Technological improvements that increase the speed or efficiency of these vessels could reduce the demand for our oil and gas flight transportation services. For instance, the development and implementation of equipment that reduces the amount of time necessary to load personnel on and off offshore rigs and platforms could enhance the attractiveness of marine vessels and reduce demand for flight services.\nOur Air Medical operations compete in certain markets with ground-based ambulance services. The construction of additional hospitals and medical treatment centers in currently unserved areas would likely increase the ability of ground-based ambulances to provide services currently provided by air medical providers such as us. Consequently, the construction of additional medical facilities in our markets could under certain circumstances reduce demand for our Air Medical flight transportation services.\nThe offshore helicopter services industry is cyclical.\nThe offshore helicopter services industry has historically been cyclical and is affected by the volatility of oil and gas price levels. There have been periods of high demand for our offshore services, followed by periods of low demand for our offshore services. Changes in commodity prices can have a significant effect on demand for our offshore services, and periods of low activity intensify price competition in the industry and could result in our aircraft being idle for prolonged periods. As noted elsewhere in this report, the downturn in the oil and gas markets that began in mid-2014 impacted our operations by reducing our aircraft utilization rates and intensifying pricing pressures.\nThe market value of our offshore fleet of aircraft is cyclical.\nThe fair market value of each of our offshore aircraft is dependent upon a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions affecting the oil and gas industry, including commodity prices and the level of oil and gas exploration and production;\n\u2022\nthe number of comparable aircraft servicing the market;\n\u2022\nthe types and sizes of comparable aircraft available;\n\u2022\nthe specific age and attributes of the aircraft;\n\u2022\ndemand for the aircraft in different industries; and\n\u2022\nchanges in regulation or competition from other air transport companies and other modes of transportation.\nAs a result of the decline of demand for our offshore aircraft and services over the past few years, the fair market value of our offshore aircraft has declined in recent periods and may decline further in the future. Lower aircraft values can adversely impact us in several ways, including potential asset impairment charges, potential breaches of loan covenants or lower proceeds in the event of aircraft sales.\nWe depend on a small number of helicopter manufacturers for our supply of new helicopters.\nThere are a small number of helicopter manufacturers that can meet our needs for new aircraft to expand our fleet or replace aircraft that no longer meet our needs. These manufacturers have a limited capacity to produce new helicopters, particularly heavy helicopters. In addition, there is typically a substantial delay between the order and delivery dates for most new aircraft, especially new medium and heavy helicopters, which makes it more difficult to adjust quickly to changes in industry conditions. Significant unplanned delays could delay the implementation of our business strategies or materially increase our cost of meeting our commitments to our customers. If we are unable to obtain aircraft from these manufacturers with delivery dates, prices and other terms acceptable to us, our profitability and growth prospects could be adversely impacted, and the impact may be material.\nWe require aircraft components and parts for the maintenance and repair of aircraft, and supply constraints or cost increases could adversely affect our business.\nIn connection with maintaining and repairing our aircraft, we rely on a few key vendors for the supply and overhaul of components fitted to our aircraft. These vendors have historically worked at or near full capacity supporting the aircraft production lines and the maintenance requirements of a range of customers. From time to time, these vendors may experience backlogs in their delivery schedules, and some parts may be in limited supply. If we are unable to perform timely maintenance and repairs, our aircraft may be unable to meet contract demands or may be underutilized, which could have an adverse impact on our financial performance. Additionally, cost increases for critical aircraft components or repair services could also reduce the profitability of our operations. Supply constraints or cost increases for important aircraft components and services could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nObtaining supplies of aircraft components and parts can be more challenging or costly in our foreign operations. In connection with conducting operations in foreign locations, we typically attempt to store nearby a sufficient amount of key integral parts. If we store too few of these parts, we could incur the type of maintenance and repair delays described above. On the other hand, if we store too many parts in remote locations, a portion of them could become unusable or obsolete, causing us to record impairment charges.\nFailure to develop or implement new technologies could affect our results of operations.\nMany of the aircraft that we operate are characterized by changing technology and shifting client or regulatory demands, including technology preferences. Our future growth and financial performance will depend in part upon our ability to develop, market and integrate new services and to accommodate the latest technological advances and client preferences. If we are unable to upgrade our operations or fleet with the latest technological advances in a timely manner, or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nOur Air Medical operations expose us to numerous special risks, including collection risks and potential medical malpractice claims.\nOur Air Medical operations expose us to a number of risks that we do not encounter in our Oil and Gas operations. For instance, the fees for our Air Medical services generally are paid by insurance companies, government agencies under federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, or individual patients. Reimbursement rates vary among payor types, with commercial insurers typically reimbursing us at a higher rate than Medicare, Medicaid, and self- pay reimbursement rates. We respond to calls for emergency air medical transport without reviewing the creditworthiness or insurance coverage of the patient and are not permitted to refuse service to patients based on their inability to pay. As a result, the profitability of our Air Medical operations depends not only on our ability to generate an acceptable volume of patient transports, but also on our ability to collect our transport fees. Because our mix of customers is subject to change and their payment rates vary, the collection rates of our Air Medical invoices are more volatile than the collection rates of our Oil and Gas invoices.\nOur reliance on our ability to collect air medical transport fees gives rise to several risks. Because the mix of customers is subject to change due to a variety of factors and their payment rates vary significantly, the collection rate for our Air Medical invoices are more volatile than the collection rate of our Oil and Gas invoices. Complexity associated with patient billing typically causes delays in the collection process, which decreases our cash flows and frequently increases the risk of nonpayment. As noted further below, our collection rates are directly impacted by the number of payments we receive from third party payors and the rates they are willing or authorized by law to pay. Our collection rates may decline due to several factors beyond our control, including (i) an aging population that causes more patients to become eligible for Medicare coverage and (ii) continuing federal and state legislative action that increases the number of younger patients eligible for Medicaid coverage.\nWe employ paramedics, nurses, and other medical professionals for these operations, which can give rise to medical malpractice claims against us, which, if not fully covered by our medical malpractice insurance, could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In the normal course of transporting patients, we may come into contact with individuals suffering from an infectious disease, which could be transmitted to our employees or others. These transmissions could give rise to employee shortages, quarantines, or medical malpractice claims, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Regulatory Matters\nOur operations are heavily regulated, which restricts our flexibility and subjects us to various costs and compliance risks.\nThe aviation services industry is regulated by various laws and regulations that apply to the domestic and international markets in which we operate. Our domestic operations are heavily regulated by a number of federal and state agencies. All of our U.S. flight operations are regulated by the FAA. Aircraft accidents are subject to the jurisdiction of the National Transportation Safety Board. Standards relating to workplace health and safety are monitored by OSHA. We are also subject to various federal and state healthcare, communications, and other laws and regulations.\nThe FAA has jurisdiction over many aspects of our business, including personnel, aircraft, maintenance, training and ground facilities, and has the power to suspend or curtail the use of aircraft deemed unsafe. We are required to have an Air Taxi Certificate, granted by the FAA, to transport personnel and property domestically in our helicopters. This certificate contains operating specifications that allow us to conduct our present operations, but it is potentially subject to amendment, suspension, or revocation in accordance with procedures set forth in the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. In recent years, the FAA has imposed separate safety rules applicable to helicopter air ambulance service, which has increased our capital costs.\nFAA regulations currently require that at least 75% of our voting securities be owned or controlled by citizens of the U.S. or one of its possessions, and that our president and at least two-thirds of our directors be U.S. citizens. Currently, our president and each of our directors are U.S. citizens. Moreover, as noted further below under the heading \u201c- Other Risks Specific to our Company - Our articles of incorporation limit the ownership of voting securities by persons who are not U.S. Citizens, which could have adverse effects,\u201d our charter provides for the automatic reduction in voting power of each share of voting common stock owned or controlled by a non-U.S. citizen if necessary to comply with these regulations.\nWe are subject to significant regulatory oversight by OSHA and similar state agencies. We are also subject to the Communications Act of 1934 because of our ownership and operation of a radio communications network that we use to communicate with our pilots throughout our market territory.\nNumerous other federal statutes and rules extensively regulate our domestic offshore operations and those of our oil and gas customers. Under these statutes and rules, the federal government has broad discretion to establish the terms under which offshore properties are leased and operated, and to suspend, curtail, or modify certain or all offshore operations. A suspension or substantial\ncurtailment of offshore oil and gas operations for any prolonged period would have an immediate and materially adverse effect on us. A substantial modification of offshore operations could adversely affect the economics of such operations and result in reduced demand for our services. For additional related information, see \u201c- Other Risks Specific to our Company\u201d below.\nIn each of the international jurisdictions in which we operate, we typically must comply with a broad range of aviation and safety laws similar to those described above. In most of those markets, we must obtain approvals from civil aviation regulators to provide services. These regulatory requirements could delay, impede or prevent us from implementing plans to enter new international markets.\nAs noted in greater detail in the risk factors below, the healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal, state and local governments. Among other things, these laws and regulations govern our reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid and the privacy and security of the medical records of patients transported by us. Our domestic Air Medical operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service, and further require us to obtain, maintain and periodically renew various state ambulance licenses. If we cannot timely obtain and thereafter maintain and renew these licenses in our operating markets, our ability to conduct or expand our Air Medical operations could be adversely affected.\nMany of the principal governmental agencies that regulate us regularly conduct audits or inspections of our aircraft, facilities, training procedures, records or operations, and, if warranted by their findings, investigations of our affairs. Several of these agencies also require us to file reports confirming our continued compliance with applicable regulations. This continuous monitoring of our operations increases the risk that regulators will allege that we have failed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.\nIf we fail to comply with certain of the regulations cited above, we could lose our operating authority or participation rights under one or more of the above-described licenses, certificates, programs or laws. In addition, these detailed regulations increase our operating and compliance costs, limit our operational flexibility, and subject us to the risk of substantial fines and penalties in the event we fail to comply therewith.\nOur operations are subject to stringent and comprehensive environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. Inherent in our business is the risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities due to our (i) handling of petroleum products and generated wastes, (ii) air emissions and wastewater discharges, and (iii) historical operations and waste disposal practices. Environmental laws and regulations generally require us to obtain permits such as air emissions and wastewater permits, require us to remain in compliance with the permits, restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment in connection with regulated activities, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations. Several of these laws impose joint and several strict liability on responsible parties. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or the terms or conditions of required environmental permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations or corrective actions, and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In many cases, we would not be able to recoup our losses from insurance.\nWe currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties that have been used for many years by us or others for various aviation operational support and maintenance activities. Petroleum products and wastes may have been disposed or released on or under properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where we have arranged for such petroleum products or wastes to be taken for disposal or recycling. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of petroleum products or wastes were not under our control. Because operating and maintaining helicopters cause us to generate, handle and dispose of materials that may be classified as \u201chazardous substances,\u201d \u201chazardous wastes,\u201d or other types of regulated materials, we may incur joint and several strict liability under applicable federal laws, including the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also referred to as the Superfund Law, and the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as well as analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination, restore affected properties, or undertake measures to prevent future contamination. In addition, future spills or releases of regulated substances or the discovery of currently unknown contamination could expose us to material losses, expenditures and environmental liabilities, including liabilities resulting from lawsuits brought by private litigants or neighboring property owners or operators for personal injury or property damage related to our operations or the land on which our operations are conducted. We generally cannot recover these costs from insurance.\nOur Air Medical operations are governed by various federal and state laws and regulations concerning the disposal of medical wastes. Similar to the regulation of other hazardous substances, the regulation of the labeling, transportation and disposal of medical waste is rigorous, and subjects us to substantial potential penalties in the event we fail to comply therewith.\nChanges in any of the above-described laws, regulations or enforcement policies could require us to obtain more costly pollution control equipment or subject us to more stringent waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements or other unforeseen liabilities, any of which could require us to make significant expenditures. For example, certain domestic or foreign governmental bodies have pursued regulatory initiatives designed to restrict the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases. Any adoption of laws or regulations that limits emissions of greenhouse gases from equipment or operations could result in increased costs to reduce such emissions from our operations as well as those of our customers and could adversely affect demand for our services.\nThe healthcare industry is heavily regulated and if we fail to comply with these laws and government regulations, we could incur penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\nAs noted above, the healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by various federal, state and local governmental agencies. Comprehensive statutes and regulations govern the manner in which we provide and bill for services, our contractual relationships with our vendors and customers, our marketing activities and other aspects of our operations. Some of these laws are further described below. Failure to comply with these laws can result in civil and criminal penalties such as fines, damages and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The risk of us being found to be in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are sometimes open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nIn addition, certain state laws or regulations require our Air Medical operations to obtain and maintain accreditation with specified accreditation authorities. The accreditation process is rigorous, and any failure to obtain or maintain accreditation in any particular state could expose us to fines, penalties, loss of contracts or reputational harm.\nRecent changes in healthcare laws and regulation could have a material impact on our business.\nIn 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cPPACA\u201d), which comprehensively reformed the domestic healthcare regulatory system by introducing changes designed to expand the number of Americans with healthcare coverage and to control healthcare costs. The long-term impact of the continuing implementation of the PPACA on our Air Medical operations remains uncertain, because any benefits we may receive from serving fewer uninsured patients may be partly or fully offset by any resulting decrease in reimbursement rates per flight from Medicaid, Medicare and commercial insurance payors or by any increase in the number of Medicaid payors. Since the enactment of the PPACA, the U.S. Congress has taken additional steps impacting the availability of healthcare coverage in the U.S., which has further impacted our Air Medical operations. We anticipate that Congress, state legislatures and third-party payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems, which could result in additional fundamental changes in the U.S. healthcare system. Moreover, changes in the leadership of governmental agencies that regulate us could lead to changes in healthcare regulations or policies or changes in the manner in which they are interpreted or enforced. For all these reasons, we cannot currently assess the ultimate impact of prevailing and future healthcare laws and regulations on our business, operations, financial results or prospects.\nOur Air Medical operations are subject to comprehensive and complex laws and rules that govern the manner in which we bill and are paid for our services by third party payors, and our failure to comply with these rules could have serious consequences.\nLike most healthcare providers, the majority of our Air Medical services are paid for by private and governmental third party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid. These third party payors typically have differing and complex billing and documentation requirements that we must meet in order to receive payment for our services. Reimbursement to us is typically conditioned on our providing the correct codes and properly documenting the services, including the level of service provided, the medical necessity for the services, and the site of service.\nWe must also comply with numerous other laws applicable to our Air Medical documentation and the claims we submit for payment, including but not limited to (1) \u201ccoordination of benefits\u201d rules that dictate which payor we must bill first when a patient has potential coverage from multiple payors; (2) requirements that we timely repay any payor which pays us more than the amount to which we are entitled; (3) limitations on who we can bill for certain services; (4) requirements that our electronic claims for payment be submitted using certain standardized transaction codes and formats; and (5) laws requiring us to handle all health and financial information of our patients in a manner that complies with specified security and privacy standards. From time to time, the failure of the federal government to timely issue Medicare or Medicaid billing numbers has impeded our potential to expand operations.\nGovernmental and private third party payors and other enforcement agencies carefully audit and monitor our compliance with these and other applicable rules. Our failure to comply with the billing and other rules applicable to us could result in non-payment for services rendered or refunds of amounts previously paid for such services. In addition, non-compliance with these rules may cause us to incur civil and criminal penalties, including fines and exclusion from government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, under a number of state and federal laws.\nChanges in the rates or methods of third-party reimbursements may adversely affect Air Medical\u2019s revenue and operations.\nOur Air Medical segment derives most of its revenue from billings to third-party payors such as Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance companies. As a result, any unfavorable changes in the rates or methods of reimbursement for the services we provide could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and financial results. Over the past several years, the U.S. Congress has taken steps to reduce Medicare and Medicaid spending levels, which has resulted in lower reimbursement rates for our services and constrained our ability to charge higher amounts to cover cost increases. In addition to the above-described changes in reimbursement rates effected pursuant to the PPACA, in 2012 the U.S. Congress adopted legislation implementing \u201csequestration\u201d reductions in federal spending. Under these \u201csequestration\u201d budget cuts (as subsequently extended by Congress), Medicare provider payments have been reduced by 2% annually commencing April 1, 2013, and are scheduled to remain in effect through 2023.\nWe believe that regulatory trends in cost containment will continue, and that additional budget cuts might be imposed in the future. We cannot assure you that we will be able to offset reduced operating margins through cost reductions, increased volume, or otherwise. Future rate reductions could place downward pressure on the rates payable by private health insurance providers. Any such rate reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOngoing scrutiny of the air medical industry could lead to additional regulation.\nIn recent years, various consumer interest groups have questioned the billing practices used in the air medical industry, and proposed changes in billing practices designed to enhance customer protection. Certain provisions of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 are intended to promote further study of this issue, including the creation of an advisory committee tasked with studying certain industry issues. It is currently unclear whether these industry trends or studies will lead to additional regulation of the air medical industry. Any such regulation could heighten scrutiny of our operations, impact our billing practices, increase our costs or otherwise adversely impact our air medical segment.\nUnder federal privacy laws, our Air Medical operations are subject to more stringent penalties in the event we improperly use or disclose protected health information regarding our patients.\nCertain privacy regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, contain detailed requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information by our Air Medical operations. In addition to complying with these privacy requirements, we must implement certain administrative, physical, and technical security standards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of certain electronic health information received, maintained, or transmitted by us or our business associates. Subsequent federal legislation or regulations have increased both the risk and consequences of enforcement actions, and increased our obligations to notify patients, the federal government or the media in the event of certain specified breaches of protected health data.\nMany states in which we operate also have state laws that protect the privacy and security of confidential personal information. These laws may be similar to or even more protective than the federal provisions. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but some may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. California\u2019s patient privacy laws, for example, provide for substantial penalties and permit injured parties to sue for damages.\nOur relationships with our vendors and customers and our marketing practices are subject to the federal Anti- Kickback Statute and similar state laws.\nWe are subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of \u201cremuneration\u201d in return for, or to induce, the referral of business or ordering of services paid for by Medicare or other federal programs. \u201cRemuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to mean anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, credit arrangement and in-kind goods or services, as well as cash. Certain federal courts have held that the Anti-Kickback Statute can be violated if \u201cone purpose\u201d of a payment is to induce referrals. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in imprisonment, civil or criminal fines or exclusion from Medicare and other governmental programs. The PPACA amended the Anti-Kickback Statute in a manner that makes it easier for the government to demonstrate intent to violate the statute, which is an element of a violation.\nMany states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any payor, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Exclusions from liability differ from state to state, rendering compliance more difficult and uncertain.\nThe federal False Claims Act is used frequently by the government and private parties against healthcare providers in challenging the accuracy of their claims for reimbursement and other conduct related to such claims.\nThe federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The False Claims Act allows a private individual to bring \u201cqui tam\u201d actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program.\nCertain regulations dictate how we have structured our operations, and subject us to various costs and uncertainties.\nThe U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services require us to complete and periodically update enrollment forms in order to obtain and maintain certification to receive reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid. Under applicable regulations, relatively inconsequential changes in our corporate structure or ownership might require us to provide notice of the changes and to re-enroll or take other steps necessary to maintain our certification to participate in these programs. In addition, certain FAA regulations are designed to ensure that license holders can demonstrate their control of assets, services and competent personnel necessary to provide safe flight services. In response to these regulatory requirements, we have segregated the operations of our different operating segments, which in certain instances has increased our operating and administrative costs. Although we believe our organizational structure is substantially consistent with applicable governmental regulations, we cannot assure you of this.\nWe are exposed to risks arising out of laws, regulations and disclosure standards affecting all U.S. public companies.\nLaws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act adopted in 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act adopted in 2010, and related regulations implemented thereunder, have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time consuming. Any failure to successfully or timely complete annual assessments of our internal controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could subject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results or our reputation with investors, lenders and others.\nIf we are unable to effectively adapt to changes in the healthcare industry, our business may be harmed.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental change. As noted above, the long-term impact of the PPACA remains unknown, but could be substantial. We anticipate that Congress and state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare delivery system. We cannot assure you as to the ultimate content, timing or effect of changes, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of potential legislation. Similarly, changes in private payor reimbursement programs could lead to adverse changes in government payor programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in any of the above-described laws or regulations may limit our ability to plan and could subject us to further costs or constraints.\nFrom time to time, the laws or regulations governing us or our customers, or the government\u2019s policy of enforcing those laws or regulations, have changed frequently and materially, particularly in the recent past with respect to laws applicable to medical operations. The variability of these laws could hamper the ability of us and our customers to plan for the future or establish long-term strategies. Moreover, future changes in these laws or regulations could further increase our operating or compliance costs, or further restrict our operational flexibility, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, competitive position, financial condition or prospects.\nOther Risks Specific to our Company\nWe are highly dependent on the offshore oil and gas industry.\nApproximately 56% of our 2018 operating revenue was attributable to providing helicopter services for offshore oil and gas exploration and production companies. Our business is highly dependent on the level of exploration, development and production activity by oil and gas companies. The level of exploration, development and production activity is directly affected by trends in\noil and gas prices, which historically have been volatile and difficult to predict. Oil and gas prices are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand, economic growth trends, market uncertainty and a variety of other factors beyond our control. Lower oil and natural gas prices generally lead to decreased spending by our customers over time.\nThe level of prevailing oil and gas prices depends on various factors that we cannot control, including:\n\u2022\nthe supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas and market expectations regarding supply and demand;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing and producing oil and gas;\n\u2022\nweather-related or other natural causes;\n\u2022\nactions of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Middle Eastern and other oil producing countries to control prices or change production levels;\n\u2022\nchanges in exploration, development or production technologies relating to offshore or onshore oil and gas deposits;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels or energy sources;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which taxes, tax credits, environmental regulations, auctions of mineral rights, drilling permits, drilling concessions, drilling moratoriums (including actions similar to the moratorium imposed as a result of the Deepwater Horizon accident described below) or other governmental regulations, actions or policies affect the production, cost of production, price or availability of petroleum products and alternative energy sources;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions in the United States and worldwide; and\n\u2022\ngeo-political instabilities, including those resulting from war, civil unrest or terrorist activities.\nAny substantial or extended decline in the price of oil or natural gas, such as the one that commenced in mid-2014, depresses the level of helicopter activity in support of exploration and production activity and thus reduces the demand for our offshore flight services.\nMoreover, weakness in the oil and gas industry generally weakens the financial position of our customers, which in turn could cause them to fail to pay amounts owed to us in a timely manner or at all. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nThe Gulf of Mexico is generally considered to be a mature area for oil and gas exploration, which may result in a continuing decrease in activity over time. This could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the concentrated nature of our operations subjects us to the risk that a regional event could cause a significant interruption in our operations or otherwise have a material effect on our profitability.\nChanges in industry conditions that increase the prospects or profitability of onshore drilling, which generally does not require use of our helicopter services, could have an adverse effect on our operations. For instance, if onshore fracking continues to meaningfully increase the supply of hydrocarbons, it could reduce the level of domestic or foreign offshore exploration and production and the demand for our helicopter services.\nThe demand for oil and natural gas could be influenced by changes in technology or other events outside of our control. Increased use of battery-powered vehicles or other alternative energy sources could significantly reduce the demand for fossil fuels.\nThe implementation of cost-saving measures by our oil and gas customers could result in lower demand for our services.\nCompanies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry continually seek to implement cost-savings measures, especially when prevailing oil and gas prices are depressed. As part of these measures, oil and gas companies have attempted to improve operating efficiencies with respect to helicopter support services. For example, certain oil and gas companies have pooled helicopter services among operators, reduced staffing levels by using technology to permit unmanned production installations and decreased the frequency of transportation of employees offshore by increasing the lengths of shifts offshore. The continued implementation of such measures or any decision of these companies to initiate their own helicopter support services could reduce demand or prevailing prices for our helicopter services and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are substantially dependent on servicing deepwater facilities in the Gulf of Mexico with heavy aircraft.\nApproximately 38% of our oil and gas segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were attributable to our deepwater operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Consequently, our oil and gas operations are significantly dependent upon the availability of the heavy aircraft that we have purchased or leased to service this market segment. If regulatory authorities, PHI, or PHI\u2019s customers were to deem these aircraft unsafe and suspend or curtail their use, our operating activities, financial position, cash flow and prospects could be materially adversely effected. Industry experts expect more drilling platforms to be decommissioned than\ninstalled in shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico over the next 10 to 15 years, which would result in a systemic decline in the number of shallow water platforms that require flight services. If these market projections prove to be accurate, our domestic offshore operations will in the future be even more dependent than we are now on serving deepwater facilities in the Gulf of Mexico.\nMoreover, any reduction in deepwater drilling activities could significantly impact our operations. As a result of the well-publicized sinking of the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, the U.S. Department of the Interior imposed a moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico from May through October 2010. The moratorium had a significant adverse impact on our business, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first half of 2011. Any future accident or development that has a similar adverse impact on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico or other markets could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on a small number of large customers for a significant portion of our revenues.\nOur Oil and Gas segment derives a substantial portion of its operating revenues and income from a limited number of major and independent oil and gas companies. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 24.6% of our operating revenues were attributable to our two largest Oil and Gas customers and our largest Air Medical customer, in the aggregate. For the same period, approximately 38.1% of our operating revenues were attributable collectively to our top five largest customers. We cannot assure you that these customers will continue to contract with us on terms or at rates currently in effect, or will not elect to contract with our competitors or perform their own transportation services themselves. The loss of one of our top customers, if not offset by revenues from new or other existing customers, would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. In addition, our concentration of customers within the oil and gas industry may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions.\nConsolidation of our offshore customer base could adversely affect demand for our services and reduce our revenues.\nMany of our Oil and Gas customers are international, major integrated or independent oil and gas exploration, development and production companies. In recent years, these companies have undergone substantial consolidation, and additional consolidation is possible. Consolidation results in fewer companies to charter or contract for our offshore services. In the event one of our customers combines with a company that is using services of one of our competitors, the combined company could decide to use the services of that competitor or another provider. Further, merger activity could impact exploration, development and production activity in other ways, particularly if the combined company adopts a combined exploration and development budget that is lower than the total budget of both companies before consolidation.\nOur domestic pilot workforce is represented by a union, although we and the union do not have a current agreed upon collective bargaining agreement.\nOur domestic pilots are represented by the Office and Professional Employees International Union (the \u201cOPEIU\u201d). We have not had a collective bargaining agreement with the OPEIU in several years, and bargaining was deferred for years during the pendency of OPEIU\u2019s suit against us, which was terminated in late 2013. At this time, we cannot predict the impact of future negotiations with the OPEIU, or when or whether a new agreement might be reached. If an agreement is reached, such agreement may cause us to incur additional expenses related to our employees, thereby reducing our profits and impacting our financial results negatively. Additionally, if an agreement is not reached and there are labor disputes, including strikes, our operations and flight services could suffer, thereby negatively impacting our financial results.\nApproximately 100 of our Australian pilots and ground staff are represented by two unions pursuant to bargaining agreements, one of which recently lapsed. We are also a party to one other agreement covering a limited number of our New Zealand pilots. We cannot assure you that these agreements will be extended in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nOur ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to our future success, and, in certain instances, could be influenced by events beyond our control.\nWe are materially reliant on the skills, experience and performance of a limited number of senior officers. If we lose the services of key managers and cannot attract equally qualified replacement personnel, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nSimilarly, our ability to attract and retain qualified pilots, mechanics, technicians, nurses, paramedics, and other highly-trained personnel is an important factor in determining our future success. The market for these experienced and highly-trained personnel is competitive and may become more competitive. Several of our Air Medical operating bases are located in rural areas, which potentially increases the difficulty of locating qualified personnel. Many of our customers require pilots of aircraft that service them to have extremely high levels of flight experience. Accordingly, we cannot be assured that we will be successful in our efforts\nto attract and retain such personnel in the future. A limited supply of qualified applicants may contribute to wage increases that increase our operating costs.\nA substantial portion of our helicopter pilots previously served in the U.S. military. Reductions in the pool of ex-military pilots, whether caused by retirements or other factors, will reduce the pool of pilots qualified to fly our helicopters. This could adversely impact our ability to provide services or increase the compensation necessary to attract and retain our pilots.\nMoreover, several of our pilots are subject, under certain circumstances, to being called upon to provide additional military services or National Guard services. If a substantial number of our pilots were called upon within a short period of time or during a time of pilot shortages, our operations could be disrupted or adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to potential security breaches or other system failures.\nAs service providers, we rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, to bill our customers, to monitor the flights of our aircraft, to communicate with our pilots, employees, suppliers, customers and others, to manage or support a variety of our other business operations, transactions and processes, and to maintain various records, which may include personally identifiable information of customers, employees or other third parties. Additionally, this information may include medical information that is subject to and regulated by privacy laws, as described further in the risk factors referenced above.\nSystem failures could materially disrupt our ability to conduct operations and security breaches could compromise the confidentiality of our data or our customer\u2019s data. We make significant efforts to maintain the integrity and continuity of our systems and to safeguard the security of these types of information, including maintaining contingency plans in the event of security breaches or other system failures. We cannot assure you that our security efforts and measures will prevent service disruptions, unauthorized access to our systems, loss or destruction of data, account takeovers, or other forms of cyber-attacks or similar events, whether caused by mechanical failures, human error, aging equipment or accidental technological failure. These threats may also stem from fraud, malice or sabotage on the part of employees, third parties or foreign nations, including attempts by outside parties to fraudulently induce our employees or customers to disclose or grant access to our data or our customers\u2019 data, potentially including information subject to stringent domestic and foreign data protection laws governing personally identifiable information, protected health information or other similar types of sensitive data. Each of these risks could further intensify to the extent we maintain information in digital form stored on servers connected to the Internet. The frequency, scope and sophistication of cyber-attacks continue to grow, which increases the possibility that our security measures will be unable to prevent our systems\u2019 improper functioning or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information (including medical information). Any failure of our information or communications systems, whether caused by attacks, mechanical failures, natural disasters or otherwise, could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, or subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties, any of which could materially and adversely affect us. Although we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions (including self-insured deductibles, coverage restrictions and monetary coverage caps), cover certain aspects of our cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our losses.\nOur Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer is also one of our principal shareholders and has voting control of the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Al A. Gonsoulin, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned stock representing over 70.9% of the total voting power of our capital stock. As a result, he exercises control over the election of all of our directors and the outcome of all matters requiring a shareholder vote. This ownership also may delay or prevent a change in our management or a change in control of us, even if such changes would benefit our other shareholders and were supported by a majority of our shareholders.\nAs a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules, we qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements designed to protect investors.\nAs a result of Mr. Gonsoulin\u2019s controlling interest, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of NASDAQ. As a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we may elect to forgo compliance with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that we (i) maintain a board of directors comprised of a majority of independent directors, (ii) maintain a compensation committee comprised entirely of independent directors, and (iii) authorize independent directors to select or recommend our director nominees.\nCurrently, outside directors are not overseeing our director nomination process. Although currently we voluntarily maintain a board comprised of a majority of independent directors and a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors,\nwe cannot assure you that this will continue to be the case in the future. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ.\nOur international operations are subject to political, economic and regulatory uncertainty.\nOver the past several years, we commenced operations in several foreign countries and in late 2017 we acquired additional overseas operations from HNZ. Our international operations represented approximately 23.3% of our total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 239 aircraft located in 8 countries outside of the U.S.\nOur international operations are subject to U.S. and other laws and regulations regarding operations in foreign jurisdictions in which we provide services. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include anti-corruption laws, anti-competition laws, anti-boycott laws, tax laws, immigration laws, privacy laws and accounting requirements. Regulations that require the awarding of contracts to local contractors or the employment of local citizens may adversely affect our competitiveness in these jurisdictions. Local laws and regulations, and their interpretation and enforcement, differ significantly among those jurisdictions, and can change significantly over time. There is a risk that these laws or regulations may materially restrict our ability to deliver services in various foreign jurisdictions or could be breached through inadvertence or mistake, fraudulent or negligent behavior of our employees or agents, failure to comply with certain formal documentation or technical requirements, or otherwise. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us or our personnel, or prohibitions on the conduct of our business or our ability to operate in one or more countries, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.\nIn addition to these international regulatory risks, some of the other risks inherent in conducting business internationally include:\n\u2022\ntax, licensing, political or other business restrictions or requirements;\n\u2022\nproblems collecting accounts receivable in a timely manner or at all;\n\u2022\nuncertainties concerning import and export restrictions, including the risk of fines or penalties assessed for violating export restrictions by the Office of Foreign Assets Controls of the U.S. Department of Treasury;\n\u2022\nembargoes or other restrictive governmental actions that could limit our ability to operate in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nadditional U.S. and other regulation of non-domestic operations, including regulation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, as well as other anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022\neconomic, social and political instability, with the attendant risks of terrorism, kidnapping, extortion, civic unrest and potential seizure or nationalization of assets;\n\u2022\ncurrency and repatriation restrictions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nthe ability to secure and maintain the necessary physical infrastructure supporting operations;\n\u2022\npotential submission of disputes to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel;\n\u2022\nthe inability to enforce our contract rights, either due to under-developed legal systems or government actions that result in a deprivation of contract rights;\n\u2022\npandemics or epidemics that disrupt our ability to transport people, fly our aircraft or otherwise conduct operations;\n\u2022\nlimitations in the availability, amount or terms of insurance coverage;\n\u2022\nlaws, policies or practices that restrict with whom we can contract or otherwise limit the scope of operations that can legally or practicably be conducted within any particular country;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of unanticipated or increased taxes, increased environmental and safety regulations or other forms of public or governmental regulation that increase our operating expenses; and\n\u2022\nchallenges in staffing and managing foreign operations, including logistical and communication challenges.\nMany of these risks are beyond our control, and we cannot predict the nature or the likelihood of the occurrence or corresponding effect of any such events, each of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in certain international areas through foreign entities that we do not control, which subjects us to a variety of risks.\nIn order to effectively compete in certain foreign jurisdictions, it is frequently necessary or required to establish joint ventures, strategic alliances or marketing arrangements with local operators, partners or agents. Frequently, we elect or are required by law to hold non-controlling investments in entities governed by foreign laws. As a result of not owning a majority interest in our unconsolidated affiliates, we do not have the ability to control their policies, management or operations, including the scope and quality of the services provided by these affiliates. Moreover, in certain instances, these local operators, partners or agents may have interests that are not always aligned with ours. Reliance on local operators, partners or agents could expose us to the risk of being held liable under the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws for actions taken by our strategic or local partners or agents even though these partners or agents may not themselves be subject to the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws. Any\ndetermination that we have violated the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation or prospects.\nIn certain foreign jurisdictions, we are subject to governmental regulation that limits foreign ownership of aircraft companies in favor of domestic ownership. Based on regulations in various markets in which we operate, our aircraft may be subject to deregistration and we may lose our ability to operate within these countries if certain levels of local ownership are not maintained. Any such actions could materially harm our ability to operate in such jurisdictions.\nRegional instability in the Middle East and other of our overseas markets could adversely affect business conditions and disrupt our operations.\nWe currently operate in several foreign regions, including in the Middle East, the Mediterranean Sea and West Africa. Many of these areas, particularly in the Middle East, have experienced political, economic and social uncertainties. Adjoining or nearby countries have experienced civil war, military campaigns, civil unrest, terrorist activities, political turbulence or other forms of unrest. Any of these forms of unrest in areas in which we operate could adversely impact our operations in several ways, including endangering the safety of our personnel in the region, interfering with our ability to transport parts or personnel to the region, disrupting our operations, increasing our operating costs, and subjecting us to the risk of expropriation or other substantial changes in laws or regulations governing our overseas operations. Any of these could materially and adversely affect our overseas business or operations.\nOur attempts to enter new international markets may not be successful.\nTo diversify our operations and maximize usage of our fleet, we periodically seek to enter new international markets, particularly to provide offshore services. To enter new markets, we typically must obtain an operating license and develop new procedures, practices and logistics to accommodate the geographic, weather, competitive and regulatory conditions of the new market. These efforts may be time consuming or costly, and may be opposed by incumbent operators. Moreover, as noted above, we frequently must establish joint ventures or similar arrangements with local partners. For all these reasons, we cannot assure you that our attempts to enter new international markets will succeed.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws and Louisiana law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of us, which could discourage a takeover of our company and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nAlthough an attempted hostile takeover of our company is unlikely by virtue of our Chief Executive Officer\u2019s controlling voting interest, there are also provisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would result in the purchase of our company\u2019s securities at a premium to the market price or would otherwise be beneficial to you. For example, our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us.\nIn addition, provisions of our by-laws, such as giving the board the exclusive right to fill all board vacancies, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. For a complete understanding of our by-laws, you should read them in their entirety.\nOur articles of incorporation limit the ownership of voting securities by persons who are not U.S. citizens, which could have certain adverse effects.\nWe must comply with certain securities ownership requirements in order to assure that we will be permitted to hold operating certificates issued by the FAA pursuant to regulations promulgated under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended. Failure to comply with these requirements could jeopardize our continued ability to hold FAA operating certificates. To assure such compliance, our articles of incorporation (our \u201cArticles\u201d) include certain provisions designed to enable us to regulate the ownership of our capital stock by persons who are not citizens of the United States.\nOur Articles provide that if at any time the voting interest of Non-Citizen Owned Shares (as defined in our Articles) exceeds the Permitted Percentage (as defined in our Articles, and which such percentage is currently 24%), then (i) the voting power otherwise attributable to each Non-Citizen Owned Share will be immediately and automatically reduced on a pro rata basis in the manner prescribed therein without any further action by us so that the maximum number of votes that may be cast by the holders of all Non-Citizen Owned Shares shall equal the Permitted Percentage and (ii) the total voting power of any affected class or series of voting securities will also be immediately and automatically reduced without any further action by us to give effect to such above-described change.\nThese foreign ownership restrictions could limit the trading liquidity of our common stock by reducing our pool of potential shareholders. In addition, if we were to seek to sell any portion of our business that requires holding an FAA operating certificate, we would have fewer potential purchasers, since some potential purchasers might be unable or unwilling to satisfy the foreign ownership restrictions described above. As a result, the sales price for that portion of our business may not attain the amount that could be obtained in an unregulated market.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited if we experience an ownership change, including in connection with our Chapter 11 Cases.\nAs described in Note 9 - Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report, we have substantial net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) available to offset future taxable income. Our ability to use our federal NOLs could be substantially limited if we were to experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d). Generally, an ownership change occurs when the percentage of a corporation\u2019s stock (by value) owned by all of the corporation\u2019s 5% shareholders (as determined pursuant to the IRC), as a group, has increased by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock (by value) owned by the 5% shareholders, as a group, at any time during the past three years. A corporation must test to determine whether it has had an ownership change on any date that a 5% shareholder acquires stock. Changes in ownership of our stock are generally not within our control. If an ownership change were to occur, the use of our federal NOLs would be subject to an annual limit, generally equal to the value of the company multiplied by the long-term tax exempt rate, which could substantially limit our ability to use the NOLs each year and could result in NOLs expiring unused. Use of our state NOLs may also be limited by an ownership change. Following the implementation of a plan of reorganization, it is possible that an \u201cownership change\u201d may be deemed to occur. In addition, the NOLs can be reduced from the amount of discharge of indebtedness arising in the Chapter 11 Cases under Section 108 of the IRC.\nTax audits or changes in tax laws could adversely affect us.\nLike all large businesses, we are subject to frequent and regular audits by the Internal Revenue Service as well as state and local tax authorities. These audits could subject us to tax liabilities if adverse positions are taken by these tax authorities. We believe that we have adequately provided for tax contingencies. However, our tax audits and examinations may result in tax liabilities that differ materially from those that we have recognized in our consolidated financial statements. Because the ultimate outcomes of all of these matters are uncertain, we can give no assurance as to whether an adverse result from one or more of them will have a material effect on our financial results.\nRisks Relating to Our 2017 Acquisition of HNZ\u2019s Offshore Business\nWe may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nWe continue to devote management attention and resources to integrating certain of our business practices and operations with those of HNZ\u2019s offshore business. We may encounter difficulties in the integration process, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe complexities associated with managing the combined businesses out of several different locations and integrating personnel from the two companies, while at the same time attempting to provide consistent, high quality services under a unified culture;\n\u2022\nthe additional complexities of combining businesses with different markets, customer bases, histories and regulatory restrictions;\n\u2022\nthe failure to retain key employees of either of the two companies;\n\u2022\nthe inability to successfully integrate HNZ\u2019s offshore business in a manner that permits the us to achieve anticipated cost savings, which would result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisition not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or regulatory conditions associated with the acquisition; and\n\u2022\nperformance shortfalls at one or both of the two companies as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by completing the acquisition and integrating the companies\u2019 operations.\nFor all these reasons, you should be aware that it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of the our management, the disruption of the our ongoing business or inconsistencies in our services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, or could otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.\nFollowing the acquisition of HNZ\u2019s offshore business, we may be unable to retain key employees.\nOur success after the acquisition of HNZ\u2019s offshore aviation services business will depend in part upon our ability to retain key PHI and HNZ offshore employees. Key employees may depart either before or after the acquisition because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us following the acquisition. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to retain key employees to the same extent that we or HNZ have been able to in the past.", "PERMNO": 62376, "SIC": 4522, "TIC": "PHIKQ"}
