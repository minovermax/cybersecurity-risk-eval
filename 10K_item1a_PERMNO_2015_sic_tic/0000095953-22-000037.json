{"cik": "95953", "company": "SYNALLOY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business that could adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that we believe to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described are not the only risks and uncertainties that could affect our business. Reference should be made to \"Forward-Looking Statements\" above, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 below.\nIndustry and Segment Risks\nThe demand for our products may be cyclical, creating uncertainty regarding future profitability.\nVarious changes in general economic conditions affect (or disproportionately affect) the industries in which our customers operate. These changes include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers\u2019 products due to economic downturns. Other factors causing fluctuation in our customers\u2019 positions are changes in market demand, capital spending, tariff induced price changes, lower overall pricing due to domestic and international overcapacity, lower priced imports, currency fluctuations, and increases in use or decreases in prices of substitute materials. As a result of these factors, our profitability has been and may in the future be subject to significant fluctuation.\nDomestic competition and excess manufacturing capacity could force lower product pricing and may have an adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nFrom time-to-time, intense competition and excess manufacturing capacity in the commodity stainless and galvanized steel industry have resulted in reduced selling prices, excluding raw material surcharges, for many of our stainless steel products sold by the Metals Segment. In such situations, in order to maintain market share, we would have to lower our prices to match the competition. These factors have had and may in the future have a material adverse impact on our revenues, operating results and financial condition.\nOvercapacity and overproduction by foreign producers in our industry could result in lower domestic prices, which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability.\nOur business is susceptible to the import of products from other countries, particularly in our Metals Segment. Import levels of various products are affected by, among other things, overall world-wide demand, lower cost of production in other countries, the trade practices of foreign governments, government subsidies to foreign producers, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and government-imposed trade restrictions in the United States, such as imposed in 2018 under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (section 232 tariffs). Although imports from certain countries have been curtailed by anti-dumping duties, imported products from other countries could significantly reduce prices. Increased imports of certain products, whether illegal dumping or legal imports, could reduce demand for our products or cause us to lower our prices to maintain demand for our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, or results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our sales in the Specialty Chemicals Segment is dependent upon a limited number of customers. The top 15 customers in the Specialty Chemicals Segment accounted for approximately 60% and 63% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with the top customer accounting for approximately 15% of revenues for 2021 and 16% of revenues for 2020. An adverse change in, or termination of, the relationship with one or more of our top customers could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOperations and Supply Chain Risks\nAny interruption in our ability to procure raw materials, or significant volatility in the price of raw materials, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWhile the Company believes that raw materials for both segments are (in general) readily available from numerous sources, some of our raw material needs are met by a sole supplier or only a few suppliers and many such relationships are terminable by either party. If any key supplier that we rely on for raw materials ceases or limits production, we may incur significant additional costs, including capital costs, in order to find alternate, reliable raw material suppliers. We may also experience significant production delays while locating new supply sources, which could result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers.\nIn addition, purchase prices and availability of these critical raw materials are subject to volatility which may negatively impact financial performance due to decreased sales volume and /or decreased profitability. At any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials on a timely basis, at acceptable prices and other terms, or at all. If suppliers increase the price of critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. As well, though we attempt to pass changes in the prices of raw materials along to our customers, we cannot always do so due to market competition, among other reasons, or price increases to customers may occur on a delayed basis. In addition, although raw materials may remain available, volatility in raw material pricing may negatively impact customer ordering patterns.\nThe loss of or reduced supply from one or more key suppliers in either segment, or any other material change in our current supply channels, could materially affect the Company\u2019s ability to meet the demand for its products and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. In addition, any limitations (or delay) on our ability to pass through any price increases in raw materials could have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nLoss of a key supplier or lack of product availability from suppliers could adversely affect our sales and earnings.\nOur Specialty Chemicals Segment depends on maintaining an immediately available supply of various products to meet customer demand. Many of our relationships with key product suppliers are longstanding but are terminable by either party. The loss of key supplier authorizations, or a substantial decrease in the availability of their products, could put us at a competitive disadvantage and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Supply interruptions could arise from raw material shortages, inadequate manufacturing capacity or utilization to meet demand, financial difficulties, tariffs and other regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries, labor disputes, weather conditions affecting suppliers' production, transportation disruptions or other reasons beyond our control.\nOur operating results are sensitive to the availability and cost of energy and freight, which are important in the manufacture and transport of our products.\nOur operating costs increase when energy or freight costs rise. During periods of increasing energy and freight costs, we might not be able to fully recover our operating cost increases through price increases without reducing demand for our products. In addition, we are dependent on third party freight carriers to transport many of our products, all of which are dependent on fuel to transport our products. The prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil, diesel fuel and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by political and economic factors beyond our control. Disruptions in the supply of energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture products for customers and may result in the decline of freight carrier capacity in our geographic markets, or make freight carriers unavailable or more expensive. Further, increases in energy or freight costs that cannot be passed on to customers, or adverse changes in our costs relative to energy and freight costs paid by competitors, has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our profitability.\nWe are dependent upon the continued operation of our production facilities, which are subject to a number of hazards.\nOur manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures. In addition, our production facilities are subject to hazards associated with the manufacture, handling, storage and transportation of materials and products, including leaks and ruptures, explosions, fires, inclement weather and natural disasters, unscheduled downtime and environmental hazards. As well, some of our production capabilities are highly specialized, which limits our ability to shift production to another facility. The occurrence of incidents in the future may result in production delays, failure to timely fulfill customer orders or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations present significant risk of injury and other liabilities.\nThe industrial activities conducted at our facilities present significant risk of serious injury or even death to our employees or other visitors to our operations, notwithstanding our safety precautions, including our material compliance with federal, state and local employee health and safety regulations, and we may be unable to avoid material liabilities for any such incidents. We maintain various forms of insurance, including insurance covering claims related to our properties and risks associated with our operations, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be applicable and adequate, or will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liability to us for any injuries or deaths.\nWe may not be able to make the operational and product changes necessary to continue to be an effective competitor.\nWe must continue to enhance our existing products, develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities, and accurately predict future customer needs and preferences in order to continue to be an effective competitor in our business markets. In addition, we must anticipate and respond to changes in industry standards, including government regulations, that affect our products and the needs of our customers. The success of any new or enhanced products will depend on a number of factors, such as technological innovations, increased manufacturing and material costs, customer acceptance, and the performance and quality of the new or enhanced products. We cannot predict the level of market acceptance or the amount of market share these new or enhanced products may achieve, and we may experience delays or problems in the introduction of new or enhanced products. Any failure in our ability to effectively and efficiently launch new or enhanced products could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nGovernment Regulation Risks\nOur operations expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities and obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other things:\n\u2022the generation, use, storage, treatment, transportation, disposal and management of hazardous substances and wastes;\n\u2022emissions or discharges of pollutants or other substances into the environment;\n\u2022investigation and remediation of, and damages resulting from, releases of hazardous substances; and\n\u2022the health and safety of our employees.\nUnder certain environmental laws, we can be held strictly liable for hazardous substance contamination of any real property we have ever owned, operated or used as a disposal site. We are also required to maintain various environmental permits and licenses, many of which require periodic modification and renewal. Our operations entail the risk of violations of those laws\nand regulations, and we may not have been in the past or will be at all times in the future, in compliance with all of these requirements. In addition, these requirements and their enforcement may become more stringent in the future.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional capital expenditures (in addition to ordinary or other costs and capital expenditures) to comply with applicable environmental laws. Our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and permit requirements could result in civil and/or criminal fines or penalties, enforcement actions, and regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, such as the installation of pollution control equipment, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are currently, and may in the future be, required to investigate, remediate or otherwise address contamination at our current or former facilities. Many of our current and former facilities have a history of industrial usage for which additional investigation, remediation or other obligations could arise in the future and that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we are currently, and could in the future be, responsible for costs to address contamination identified at any real property we used as a disposal site.\nAlthough we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with any of the requirements described above, the costs could be material. Non-compliance could subject us to material liabilities, such as government fines, third-party lawsuits or the suspension of non-compliant operations. We also may be required to make significant site or operational modifications at substantial cost. Future developments also could restrict or eliminate the use of or require us to make modifications to our products, which could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations. At any given time, we are (or may be) involved in claims, litigation, administrative proceedings and investigations of various types involving potential environmental liabilities, including cleanup costs associated with hazardous waste disposal sites at our facilities. We cannot assure you that the resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The occurrence and ultimate costs and timing of environmental liabilities are difficult to predict. Liability under environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis. We could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, civil or criminal fines and sanctions and third-party claims, as a result of past or future violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws.\nWe could be subject to third party claims for property damage, personal injury, nuisance or otherwise as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental, health or safety laws in connection with releases of hazardous or other materials at any current or former facility. We could also be subject to environmental indemnification claims in connection with assets and businesses that we have acquired or divested.\nThere can be no assurance that any future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws, as well as costs incurred to address contamination or environmental claims, will not exceed any current estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any unanticipated liabilities or obligations arising, for example, out of discovery of previously unknown conditions or changes in laws or regulations, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing, as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in delays or eliminate new wells from being started, thus reducing the demand for our pressure vessels and heavy walled pipe and tube.\nHydraulic fracturing (\u201cfracking\u201d) is currently an essential and common practice to extract oil from dense subsurface rock formations, and this lower cost extraction method is a significant driving force behind the surge of oil exploration and drilling in several locations in the United States. However, the Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Congress and state legislatures have considered adopting legislation to provide additional regulations and disclosures surrounding this process. In the event that new legal restrictions surrounding the fracking process are adopted in the areas in which our customers operate, we may experience a decrease in revenue, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, including profitability.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers.\nOn August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), the SEC adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These regulations require companies to conduct annual due diligence and disclose whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. Tungsten and tantalum are designated as conflict minerals under the Dodd-Frank Act. These metals are used to varying degrees in our welding materials and are also present in specialty alloy products. These new requirements\ncould adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in our products. In addition, we could incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who could require that all of the components of our products are conflict mineral-free.\nHuman Capital Risks\nCertain of our employees in the Metals Segment are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and the failure to renew these agreements could result in labor disruptions and increased labor costs.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 342 employees represented by unions at our Bristol, Tennessee, Mineral Ridge, Ohio, Munhall, Pennsylvania and Danville, Virginia facilities, which is approximately 48% of the aggregate number of Company employees. These employees are represented by three local unions affiliated with the USW and one local affiliated with the UFCW. Collective bargaining contracts for the USW locals expire at various dates between 2023 and 2024. Collective bargaining contracts for the UFCW local expires in 2024. Although we believe that our present labor relations are strong, our failure to renew these agreements on reasonable terms as the current agreements expire could result in labor disruptions and increased labor costs, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nFailure to attract and retain key personnel may adversely impact our strategy and execution and financial results.\nOur ability to successfully operate, grow our business and implement our business strategies is largely dependent on the efforts, abilities and services of our employees. The loss of employees or our inability to attract, train and retain additional personnel could reduce the competitiveness of our business or otherwise impair our operations. Our future success will also depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel who have experience in the application of our products and are knowledgeable about our business, markets and products.\nWe also face risks associated with the actions taken in response to COVID-19, including those associated with workforce reductions, and may experience difficulties with hiring additional employees or replacing employees following the pandemic, which may be exacerbated by the tight labor market. In addition, COVID-19 has, and may again result in quarantines of our personnel or an inability to access facilities, which could adversely affect our operations.\nFinancial and Strategic Risks\nThere are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $67.9 million of total outstanding indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. We have customary restrictive covenants in our current debt agreements, which may limit our flexibility to operate our business. Failure to comply with this covenant could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\nOur Credit Agreement with BMO Harris Bank N.A. (as amended, the \"Credit Agreement\") bears interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"). LIBOR is currently in the process of being phased out. The Credit Agreement includes provisions intended to provide for the replacement of LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") upon the cessation of LIBOR or the occurrence of other triggering events, with corresponding adjustments to the applicable interest rate margins. However, uncertainty as to the timing and nature of such modifications could cause the interest rate calculated for the Credit Agreement to be materially different than expected, and there is no guarantee that a transition from LIBOR to an alternative will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates, or borrowing costs to borrowers, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our failure to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness, and our inability to obtain capital on satisfactory terms or at all may have an adverse impact on our operations and our financial results.\nIf we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions, we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under the Credit Agreement. Our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. We may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we may\nhave substantial debt, our current receivable and inventory balances do not support additional debt availability or because we may not have sufficient cash flows to service or repay our existing or future debt. In addition, depending on market conditions and our financial performance, equity financing may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all. If we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions, this could have an adverse impact on our operations and our financial results.\nOur strategy of using acquisitions and dispositions to position our businesses may not always be successful, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial results and profitability.\nWe have historically utilized acquisitions and dispositions in an effort to strategically position our businesses and improve our ability to compete. We plan to continue to do this by seeking specialty niches, acquiring businesses complementary to existing strengths and continually evaluating the performance and strategic fit of our existing business units. We consider acquisitions, joint ventures and other business combination opportunities as well as possible business unit dispositions. From time-to-time, management holds discussions with management of other companies to explore such opportunities. As a result, the relative makeup of the businesses comprising our Company is subject to change. Acquisitions, joint ventures and other business combinations involve various inherent risks, such as: assessing accurately the value, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition or other transaction candidates; the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business; significant transaction costs that were not identified during due diligence; our ability to achieve identified financial and operating synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition or other transaction; impairments of goodwill; and unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquisition or other transaction. The amount and type of consideration and deal charges paid could have an adverse or dilutive effect on our profitability and other financial results, despite having anticipated long-term economic benefit to the Company. If acquisition opportunities are not available, or if one or more acquisitions are not successfully integrated into our operations, this could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and profitability.\nImpairment in the carrying value of our fixed assets, intangible assets, or goodwill could adversely affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identified net assets of businesses acquired. We review goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever circumstances change in a way which could indicate that impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level. We identify potential goodwill impairments by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, which includes goodwill and other intangible assets. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, an impairment exists. The amount of the impairment is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment exists. Factors may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors would have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. We are required to record a non-cash impairment charge if the testing performed indicates that goodwill has been impaired.\nWe evaluate the useful lives of our fixed assets and intangible assets to determine if they are definite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the lease term, future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of goodwill, fixed assets or intangible assets become impaired, there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nOur inability to sufficiently or completely protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to compete effectively in both of our business segments will depend on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of the intellectual property used in our businesses. These intellectual property rights consist largely of trade-secrets and know-how. We rely on a combination of trade secrets and non-disclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our rights in our intellectual property. We also depend upon confidentiality agreements with our officers, employees, consultants and subcontractors, as well as collaborative partners, to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property. These measures may not afford us sufficient or complete protection, and others may independently\ndevelop intellectual property similar to ours, otherwise avoid our confidentiality agreements or produce technology that would adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by global public health epidemics and pandemics, including the COVID-19 outbreak.\nOur business and operations expose us to risks associated with global health epidemics or pandemics, such as the global outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19). The outbreak has resulted in governments around the world implementing varying measures to help the control of the spread of the virus, including quarantines, \"shelter in place\" and \"stay at home\" orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments, and school closures among others. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may in the future have, a significant impact on the global economy, including supply chains, financial markets, and labor markets.\nWe are a company operating in a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Consistent with federal guidelines and with state and local orders to date, we currently continue to operate across our business footprint. Notwithstanding our continued operations, COVID-19 has had and may continue to have negative impacts on our operations and customers, which may compress our margins, including as a result of preventative and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, and governments are taking. Any future economic downturn could adversely affect the demand for our products and contribute to volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for our products and raw materials. The continued progression of the outbreak could also negatively impact our business or results of operations through the temporary closure or suspension of manufacturing operations at our operating locations or those of our customers or suppliers.\nIn addition, the ability of our employees to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to COVID-19, and as a result, may impact our production throughout our supply chain and constrict sales channels. Our customers may be directly impacted by business curtailments or weak market conditions and may not be able to fulfill their contractual obligations.\nWe encounter significant competition in all areas of our businesses and may be unable to compete effectively, which could result in reduced profitability and loss of market share.\nWe actively compete with companies producing the same or similar products and, in some instances, with companies producing different products designed for the same uses. We encounter competition from both domestic and foreign sources in price, delivery, service, performance, product innovation, and product recognition and quality, depending on the product involved. For some of our products, our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be better able to withstand a change in conditions within the industries in which we operate, a change in the prices of raw materials or a change in the economy as a whole. Our competitors can be expected to continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products and more efficient production capabilities, which could cause a decline in market acceptance of our products. Current and future consolidation among our competitors and customers also may cause a loss of market share as well as put downward pressure on pricing. Our competitors could cause a reduction in the prices for some of our products as a result of intensified price competition. Competitive pressures can also result in the loss of major customers. If we cannot compete successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.\nWe may discover weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, which may adversely affect investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and consequently the market price of our securities.\nWe may discover weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, which may adversely affect investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and consequently the market price of our securities.\nAs a public company, we are required to design and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal controls over financial reporting, which, when required, must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm. If we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated.\nThe process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is challenging and costly. In the future, we may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or if, when required, our independent registered public accounting firm\nis unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our securities could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nCybersecurity risks and cyber incidents could adversely affect our business and disrupt operations.\nCyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. The result of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, disrupted operations, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cyber security protection costs, litigation and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence. We have taken steps to address these concerns and have implemented internal control and security measures to protect our systems and networks from security breaches; however, there can be no assurance that a system or network failure, or security breach, will not impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 43334, "SIC": 3317, "TIC": "SYNL"}
