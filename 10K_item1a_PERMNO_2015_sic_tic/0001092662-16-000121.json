RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information provided in this Form 10-K before purchasing our Common Stock. The risks described below are those we currently believe may materially affect us. An investment in our Company involves a high degree of risk, and should be considered only by persons who can afford the loss of their entire investment.\nRisks related to our industry, business and strategy\nBecause we may not be able to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for some of our products, we may not generate revenues in the amounts we expect, or in the amounts necessary to continue our business. Our existing products as well as our manufacturing facility must meet quality standards and are subject to inspection by a number of domestic regulatory and other governmental and non-governmental agencies.\nAll of our proposed and existing products are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and/or other domestic and international governmental, public health agencies, regulatory bodies or non-governmental organizations. In particular, we are subject to strict governmental controls on the development, manufacture, labeling, distribution and marketing of our products. The process of obtaining required approvals or clearances varies according to the nature of, and uses for, a specific product. These processes can involve lengthy and detailed laboratory testing, human or animal clinical trials, sampling activities, and other costly, time-consuming procedures. The submission of an application to a regulatory authority does not guarantee that the authority will grant an approval or clearance for that product. Each authority may impose its own requirements and can delay or refuse to grant approval or clearance, even though a product has been approved in another country.\nThe time taken to obtain approval or clearance varies depending on the nature of the application and may result in the passage of a significant period of time from the date of submission of the application. Delays in the approval or clearance processes increase the risk that we will not succeed in introducing or selling the subject products, and we may determine to devote our resources to different products.\nChanges in government regulations could increase our costs and could require us to undergo additional trials or procedures, or could make it impractical or impossible for us to market our products for certain uses, in certain markets, or at all.\nChanges in government regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations because we may have to incur additional expenses if we are required to change or implement new testing, manufacturing and control procedures. If we are required to devote resources to develop such new procedures, we may not have sufficient resources to devote to research and development, marketing, or other activities that are critical to our business.\nWe can manufacture and sell our products only if we comply with regulations and quality standards established by government agencies such as the FDA and the USDA as well as by non-governmental organizations such as the ISO and WHO. We have implemented a quality system that is intended to comply with applicable regulations. Although FDA approval is not required for the export of our products, there are export regulations promulgated by the FDA that specifically relate to the export of our products that require compliance with FDA quality system regulation (\"QSRs\") and that also require meeting certain documentary requirements regarding the approval of the product in export markets. Although we believe that we meet the regulatory standards required for the export of our products, these regulations could change in a manner that could adversely impact our ability to export our products.\nOur products may not be able to compete with new diagnostic products or existing products developed by well-established competitors, which would negatively affect our business.\nThe diagnostic industry is focused on the testing of biological specimens in a laboratory or at the point-of-care and is highly competitive and rapidly changing. Some of our principal competitors may have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Several companies produce diagnostic tests that compete directly with our testing product line, including but not limited to, OraSure Technologies, Alere and Trinity Biotech. Furthermore these and/or other companies have or may have products incorporating molecular and/or other advanced technologies that over time could directly compete with our testing product line. As new products incorporating new technologies enter the market, our products may become obsolete or a competitor's products may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold.\nThere are competing products that could significantly reduce our U.S. sales of rapid HIV tests.\nIn 2006 Alere, Inc. acquired a division from Abbott Diagnostic located in Japan that manufactured and marketed a rapid HIV test product line called Determine\u00ae. The Determine\u00ae format was developed for the developing world and remote settings and, central to the needs of that market. The format is essentially a test strip that is integrated into a thin foil wrapper. When opened, the underside of the wrapper serves as the test surface for applying the blood sample and performing the test. This design reduces costs and shipping weights and volumes and provides an advantage for the developing world markets it serves. Some of the disadvantages of the platform are the amount of blood sample that is needed (50 microliters versus 2.5, 5 and 10 for our lateral flow barrel, lateral flow cassette, and DPP\u00ae products respectively), the open nature of the test surface, and the absence of a true control that differentiates biological from other kinds of samples.\nThe so-called \"3rd generation\" version of this product has been marketed for many years and is the leading rapid HIV test that is used in a large majority of the national algorithms of countries funded by PEPFAR and the Global Fund, as well as many other countries in the world. That product is not FDA-approved though it is CE marked. The newest Determine\u00ae HIV version, which was developed and manufactured by Alere's subsidiary in Israel, Orgenics, is the so-called \"4th Generation\" version Determine\u00ae test. According to its claims, this product detects HIV antibodies and P24 HIV antigens. Because the P24 antigen is known to occur in HIV-positive individuals' blood samples before antibodies do, the 4th generation Determine\u00ae test is designed to detect HIV infection earlier than tests that solely rely on antibody detection. Chembio's tests, as well as all of the other currently FDA-approved rapid HIV tests, only detect antibodies. There are however laboratory tests that are FDA-approved that are \"4th generation\" tests, but they are of course neither rapid nor point-of-care.\nThe initial \"4th generation\" Alere Determine\u00ae rapid test product that was also CE marked and that Alere launched internationally some years ago has not been successfully commercialized to the best of our knowledge and at least certain published studies were not favorable for this product. However the 4th generation product that is now FDA-approved was apparently modified as compared to the initial international version, and it may perform more satisfactorily. Alere received FDA approval of this modified product in August 2013 and CLIA waiver for it in December 2014. Alere is also aggressively pursuing development of the market for this product. Moreover there is support by a number of key opinion leaders for the public health value of such 4th generation tests, and this product represents a significant competitive threat to Chembio as well as to each of the other rapid HIV test manufacturers (OraSure and Trinity primarily).\nDuring 2011, Biolytical, Inc. of Vancouver, Canada received FDA approval and in 2012 received CLIA waiver of a flow-through rapid HIV test called \"INSTI\". The flow-through technology used in the INSTI test is older than lateral flow, and requires handling of multiple components (3 vials of solution) to perform the test in multiple steps. However, these steps can be accomplished in less than ten minutes, and the actual test results occur in only one minute after those steps are completed. Therefore sample-to-result time is shorter than any of the competitive products. The product also has good performance claims. There are settings where that reduced total test time, despite the multiple steps required, may be a distinct advantage, and we believe Biolytical has made some progress in penetrating certain public health markets.\nTherefore, even though our lateral flow products currently enjoy a substantial market share in the U.S. rapid HIV test market, and we have an additional rapid HIV test, the DPP\u00ae HIV 1/2 Assay, there a number of risks and uncertainties concerning current and anticipated developments in this market. Although we have no specific knowledge of any other new product that is a significant competitive threat to our products, or that will render our products obsolete, if we fail to maintain and enhance our competitive position or fail to introduce new products and product features, our customers may decide to use products developed by our competitors, which could result in a loss of revenues and cash flow.\nMore generally, the point-of-care diagnostics industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. As new technologies become introduced into the point-of-care diagnostic testing market, we may be required to commit considerable additional efforts, time and resources to enhance our current product portfolio or develop new products. We may not have the available time and resources to accomplish this, and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers, which would materially harm our operating results.\nAlthough we own our DPP\u00ae patent, lateral flow technology is still a competitive platform to DPP\u00ae, and lateral flow technology has a lower cost of manufacture than DPP\u00ae products. Although the DPP\u00ae platform has shown improved sensitivity as compared with conventional lateral flow platforms in a number of studies, several factors go into the development and performance attributes of products. Therefore the ability of our products to successfully compete will depend on several other factors, including but not limited to our having a patented rapid test platform technology that differentiates DPP\u00ae from lateral flow as well as from other diagnostic platform technologies.\nWe believe that our DPP\u00ae is outside of the scope of currently issued patents in the field of lateral flow technology, thereby offering the possibility of greater freedom to operate. However there can be no assurance that our patents or our products incorporating the patent claims will not be challenged at some time in the future.\nOur use of third-party suppliers, some of which may constitute our sole supply source, for certain important product components presents a risk that could have negative consequences for other business.\nA number of our components and critical raw materials are provided by third-party suppliers, some of which may be sole-source suppliers, which impacts our ability to manufacture or sell product if our suppliers cannot or will not deliver those materials in a timely fashion, or at all, due to an interruption in their supply, quality or technical issues, or any other reason. If this occurs, we could incur substantial expense and time to be able to reestablish the appropriate quality, cost, regulatory and market-acceptance circumstances needed for commercial success. Even with the needed expense and time, we may not be able to reestablish any or all of these factors. The absence of any one or more of these factors could prevent us from being able to commercially produce and market the affected product or products.\nNew developments in health treatments or new non-diagnostic products may reduce or eliminate the demand for our products.\nThe development and commercialization of products outside of the diagnostics industry could adversely affect sales of our products. For example, the development of a safe and effective vaccine to HIV or treatments for other diseases or conditions that our products are designed to detect, could reduce or eventually eliminate the demand for our HIV or other diagnostic products and result in a loss of revenues.\nWe may not have sufficient resources to effectively introduce and market our products, which could materially harm our operating results.\nIntroducing and achieving market acceptance for our rapid HIV tests and other new products will require substantial marketing efforts and will require us and/or our contract partners, sales agents, and/or distributors to make significant expenditures of time and money. In some instances we will be significantly or totally reliant on the marketing efforts and expenditures of our contract partners, sales agents, and/or distributors. If they do not have or commit the expertise and resources to effectively market the products that we manufacture, our operating results will be materially harmed.\nThe success of our business depends on, in addition to the market success of our products, our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity or through borrowing, and we may not be able to raise capital or borrow funds on attractive terms and/or in amounts necessary to continue our business, or at all.\nWe were profitable for five consecutive years through 2013. Nevertheless, prior to 2009 we sustained significant operating losses since 2004, and we incurred an operating loss for 2014 and 2015. We estimate that our resources are sufficient to fund our needs through the end of 2016 and beyond. Nevertheless we have already made, and may continue to make, significant financial commitments to invest in our sales and marketing organization, regulatory approvals, research and development including new technologies, and production capacity, including expanded facilities.\nOur liquidity and cash requirements will depend on several factors. These factors include (1) the level of revenues; (2) the extent to which, if any, that revenue level improves operating cash flows; (3) our investments in research and development, facilities, marketing, regulatory approvals, and other investments we may determine to make; and (4) our investment in capital equipment and the extent to which it improves cash flow through operating efficiencies. There are no assurances that we will generate positive cash flow for 2016 or, in the alternative, be successful in raising sufficient capital to fund our needs after 2016.\nOur U.S. market sales are difficult to predict in 2016 given (i) our early June 2014 termination of the agreement with a third party for exclusive distribution of our cassette product in the U.S; and (ii) the impending May 31, 2016 termination of the agreement with a third party for exclusive distribution of our barrel product in the U.S. As a result of these terminations, we expect to continue to experience higher average revenue per unit, and a lower volume of U.S. sales, of the cassette and barrel products. Higher revenue per unit is anticipated because we previously sold these products to the exclusive U.S. distributor at a significantly lower price than the price at which the distributor resold these products to customers (including re-sellers and distributors) in the United States. However at this point with respect to the barrel product, this can occur only after any inventory that the exclusive U.S. distributor has accumulated is consumed, which may take several months. In addition, in marketing these products directly, we are incurring substantial costs associated with developing our sales and marketing organization and channel distribution partners.\nWe believe that underlying demand for HIV rapid testing in the United States remains strong, and that the restoration of some of the funding cutbacks from sequestration and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and of the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendations will have a positive impact on the development of the market. Further, our products are well established and relied upon by a large installed base of customers over many years of use in the U.S. global market, and we believe this is a strong advantage. We also believe that our DPP\u00ae HIV 1/2 Assay for which CLIA waiver was obtained in October 2014, for use with oral fluid or bloods samples will be able to serve new customers that were previously unavailable to us with our lateral flow blood tests. However, development of new customers with this product is costly and time-consuming.\nWe are attempting to increase international sales of our products, and we have invested in additional resources in connection with this effort; but as we have experienced, the nature of international business is such that it can be volatile from period to period, depending on ordering patterns of donor-funded programs.\nFurthermore, a number of factors can slow or prevent sales increases or cause sales decreases, or substantially increase the cost of achieving sales assuming they are achieved. These factors include:\n\u00b7\neconomic conditions and the absence of or reduction in available funding sources;\n\u00b7\nregulatory requirements and customs regulations;\n\u00b7\ncultural and political differences;\n\u00b7\nforeign exchange rates, currency fluctuations and tariffs;\n\u00b7\ndependence on and difficulties in managing international distributors or representatives;\n\u00b7\nthe creditworthiness of foreign entities;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in foreign accounts receivable collection;\n\u00b7\ncompetition\n\u00b7\npricing; and\n\u00b7\nany inability we may have in maintaining or increasing revenues.\nIf we are unable to maintain or increase our revenues from domestic and/or international customers, our operating results will be materially harmed.\nAlthough we have an ethics and anti-corruption policy in place, and have no knowledge or reason to know of any practices by our employees, agents or distributors that could be construed as in violation of such policies, our business includes sales of products to countries where there is or may be widespread corruption.\nChembio has a policy in place prohibiting its employees, distributors and agents from engaging in corrupt business practices, including activities prohibited by the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"). Nevertheless, because we work through independent sales agents and distributors (and do not have any employees or subsidiaries) outside the United States, we do not have control over the day-to-day activities of such independent agents and distributors. In addition, in the donor-funded markets in Africa where we sell our products, there is significant oversight from PEPFAR, the Global Fund, and advisory committees comprised of technical experts concerning the development and establishment of national testing protocols. This is a process that includes an overall assessment of a product which includes extensive product performance evaluations including five active collaborations and manufacturer's quality systems, as well as price and delivery. In Brazil, where we have had a total of six product collaborations with FIOCRUZ, the programs through which our products may be deployed are all funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Although FIOCRUZ is affiliated with the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and is its sole customer, FIOCRUZ is not the exclusive supplier for the Ministry of Health. However, because each of our previous collaborations with FIOCRUZ incorporates a technology transfer aspect, we believe we have a competitive advantage versus other suppliers to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, assuming other aspects of our product offering through FIOCRUZ are otherwise competitive in comparison. We have no knowledge or reason to know of any activities by our employees, distributors or sales agents of any actions which could be in violation of the FCPA, although there can be no assurance of this.\nWe rely on trade secret laws and agreements with our key employees and other third parties to protect our proprietary rights, and we cannot be sure that these laws or agreements adequately protect our rights.\nWe believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, strategic relationships, new product developments, frequent product enhancements and name recognition are essential to our success. All of our management personnel are bound by non-disclosure agreements. If personnel leave our employment, in some cases we would be required to protect our intellectual property rights pursuant to common law theories which may be less protective than provisions of employment, non-competition or non-disclosure agreements.\nWe seek to protect our proprietary products under trade secret and copyright laws, enter into license agreements for various materials and methods employed in our products, and enter into strategic relationships for distribution of the products. These strategies afford only limited protection. We currently have some foreign patents issued, and we are seeking additional patent protection in several other foreign jurisdictions for our DPP\u00ae technology. We have licenses to reagents (antigens and peptides) used in several of our products and products under development. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary assets, and respect the intellectual property rights of others, we participate in several markets where intellectual property rights protections are of little or no value. This can place our products and our company at a competitive disadvantage.\nDespite the efforts we make to protect our confidential information, such as entering into confidentiality agreements in connection with new business opportunities, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain information that we regard as proprietary. We may be required to expend substantial resources in asserting or protecting our intellectual property rights, or in defending suits related to intellectual property rights. Disputes regarding intellectual property rights could substantially delay product development or commercialization activities because some of our available funds would be diverted away from our business activities. Disputes regarding intellectual property rights might include state, federal or foreign court litigation as well as patent interference, patent reexamination, patent reissue, or trademark opposition proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\nTo facilitate development and commercialization of a proprietary technology base, we may need to obtain additional licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from other parties. Obtaining and maintaining these licenses, which may not be available, may require the payment of up-front fees and royalties. In addition, if we are unable to obtain these types of licenses, our product development and commercialization efforts may be delayed or precluded.\nOur continued growth depends on retaining our current key employees and attracting additional qualified personnel, and we may not be able to do so.\nOur success will depend to a large extent upon the skills and experience of our executive officers, management and sales, marketing, operations and scientific staff. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among medical products businesses, geographic considerations, our ability to offer competitive compensation, relocation packages, benefits, and/or other reasons.\nIf we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to effectively manufacture, sell and market our products to meet the demands of our strategic partners in a timely fashion, or to support internal research and development programs. Although we believe we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, competition for experienced scientists and other personnel from numerous companies and academic and other research institutions may limit our ability to do so on acceptable terms.\nWe have entered into employment contracts with our Chief Executive Officer, John Sperzel, our Chief Operating Officer, Sharon Klugewicz, and our Chief Scientist & Technology Officer, Javan Esfandiari. Due to the specific knowledge and experience of these executives regarding the industry, technology and market, the loss of the services of any one of them could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The contract with Mr. Sperzel has a term of three years ending March 2017. The contract with Ms. Klugewicz has a term of two years ending May 2017. The contract with Mr. Esfandiari has a term of three years ending March 2016. The Company and Mr. Esfandiari currently are discussing terms for renewal of his employment agreement. The Company has obtained a key man insurance policy on Mr. Esfandiari. The contract with Mr. Sperzel provides that Mr. Sperzel will serve as the Chief Executive Officer and as a Director of the Company through March 13, 2017.\nWe believe our success depends in part on the continued funding of and our ability to participate in large testing programs in the U.S. and worldwide. Funding of these and or similar programs may be reduced, discontinued and/or we may not be able to participate for other reasons.\nWe believe it to be in our best interests to meaningfully participate in large testing programs. Moreover many of these programs are funded by governments and other donors, and there can be no assurance that funding will not be reduced or completely discontinued. Participation in these programs also requires alignment and engagement with the many other participants in these programs, including the World Health Organization, U.S. Center for Disease Control, U.S. Agency for International Development, foreign governments and their agencies, non-governmental organizations, and HIV service organizations. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to participate in these programs, our operating results could be materially harmed.\nIn December 2013 President Obama signed into law the PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Act, which is the most recent reauthorization of PEPFAR. However, unlike the 2008 PEPFAR authorization, which authorized approximately $45 billion in funding, the new law does not authorize a specific dollar amount for funding. Nevertheless it is widely anticipated that PEPFAR will continue to enjoy strong funding; the FY14 budget has $6 billion for global HIV/AIDS assistance, including $4 billion for PEPFAR.\nTo the extent that we are unable to collect our outstanding accounts receivable, our operating results could be materially harmed.\nThere may be circumstances and timing that require us to accept payment terms, including delayed payment terms, from distributors or customers, which, if not satisfied, could cause financial losses.\nWe generally accept payment terms which require us to ship product before the contract price has been paid fully, and there also are circumstances pursuant to which we may accept further delayed payment terms pursuant to which we may continue to deliver product. To the extent that these circumstances result in significant accounts receivables and those accounts receivables are not paid on a timely basis, or are not paid at all, especially if concentrated in one or two customers, we could suffer financial losses.\nAlthough we were profitable from 2009 through 2013, we incurred a net loss for 2014 and 2015 and cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain profitability in the future.\nFrom the inception of Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Inc. in 1985 through the period ended December 31, 2008, we incurred net losses. We were then profitable each year from 2009 through 2013. In 2014 and 2015, we made substantial expenditures for sales and marketing, regulatory submissions, product development, production and warehouse capacity, and other purposes, and we incurred a net operating loss. Our ability to re-achieve profitability in the future will primarily depend on our ability to increase sales of our products based on having made the aforementioned expenditures to reduce production and other costs, and to successfully introduce new products and enhanced versions of our existing products into the marketplace. If we are unable to increase our revenues at a rate that is sufficient to achieve profitability, or adequately control and reduce our operating costs, our operating results would be materially harmed.\nTo the extent that we are unable to obtain sufficient product liability insurance or that we incur product liability exposure that is not covered by our product liability insurance, our operating results could be materially harmed.\nWe may be held liable if any of our products, or any product which is made with the use or incorporation of any of the technologies belonging to us, causes injury of any type or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing, sale or use. We have obtained product liability insurance even though we have never received a product liability claim, and have generally not seen product liability claims for screening tests that are accompanied by appropriate disclaimers. Nevertheless, in the event there is a claim, this insurance may not fully cover our potential liabilities. In addition, as we attempt to bring new products to market, we may need to increase our product liability coverage which could be a significant additional expense that we may not be able to afford. If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost to protect us, we may be forced to abandon efforts to commercialize our products or those of our strategic partners, which would reduce our revenues.\nRisks related to our Common Stock\nOur Common Stock continues to be illiquid, so investors may not be able to sell as much stock as they want at prevailing market prices.\nThe average daily trading volume of our Common Stock on the NASDAQ market was approximately 21,600 shares per day over the three months ended December 31, 2015 as compared with approximately 109,000 shares per day over the three months ended December 31, 2014. The liquidity of our stock depends on several factors, including but not limited to the financial results of the Company and overall market conditions, so it is not possible to predict whether this level of liquidity will continue, be sustained, or decrease.\nDecreased trading volume in our stock would make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices. Our management and larger stockholders exercise significant control over the Company.\nOur management and larger stockholders exercise significant control over the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our named executive officers, directors and 5% stockholders beneficially owned approximately 24.0% of our voting power, which includes two large investors that beneficially owns approximately 11.4% and 9.2%, respectively of the outstanding stock. For the foreseeable future, and assuming these ownership percentages continue to apply, to the extent that these parties vote similarly, they may be able to exercise significant control over many matters requiring approval by the board of directors or our stockholders. As a result, they may be able to:\n\u00b7\ncontrol the composition of our board of directors;\n\u00b7\ncontrol our management and policies;\n\u00b7\ndetermine the outcome of significant corporate transactions, including changes in control that may be beneficial to stockholders; and\n\u00b7\nact in each of their own interests, which may conflict with or differ from the interests of each other or the interests of the other stockholders.", "PERMNO": 13453, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "CEMI"}
