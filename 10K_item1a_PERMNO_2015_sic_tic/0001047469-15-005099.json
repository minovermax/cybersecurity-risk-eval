{"cik": "1610250", "company": "Boot Barn Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-05-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this annual report, including our consolidated financial statements, and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nOur sales could be severely impacted by declines in consumer confidence and decreases in consumer spending or by changes in consumer preferences.\nWe depend upon consumers feeling confident about spending discretionary income on our products to drive our sales. Consumer spending may be adversely impacted by economic conditions, such as consumer confidence in future economic conditions, interest and tax rates, employment levels, salary and wage levels, general business conditions, the availability of consumer credit and the level of housing, energy and food costs. These risks may be exacerbated for retailers like us who focus on specialty footwear, apparel and accessories. Our financial performance is particularly susceptible to economic and other conditions in California and other western states where we have a significant number of stores. Our financial performance may also be susceptible to economic and other conditions relating to output and employment in the oil and gas industries, the construction sector, domestic manufacturing and the transportation and warehouse sectors because we believe that growth in these industries and sectors have driven the growth of our work wear business. In addition, our financial performance may be negatively affected if the popularity of the western and country lifestyle subsides, or if there is a general trend in consumer preferences away from boots and other western or country products in favor of another general category of footwear or attire. If this were to occur or if periods of decreased consumer spending persist, our sales could decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur continued growth depends upon successfully opening a significant number of new stores as well as integrating any acquired stores, and our failure to successfully open new stores or integrate acquired stores could negatively affect our business and stock price.\nWe have grown our store count rapidly in recent years, both organically and through strategic acquisitions of competing chains. However, we must continue to open and operate new stores to help maintain our revenue and profit growth. Our ability to successfully open and operate new stores is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, such as:\n\u2022 identifying suitable store locations, the availability of which is beyond our control;\n\u2022 obtaining acceptable lease terms;\n\u2022 sourcing sufficient levels of inventory;\n\u2022 selecting the appropriate merchandise to appeal to our customers;\n\u2022 hiring, training and retaining store employees;\n\u2022 assimilating new store employees into our corporate culture;\n\u2022 marketing the new stores' locations and product offerings effectively;\n\u2022 avoiding construction delays and cost overruns in connection with the build out of new stores;\n\u2022 avoiding other costs in opening new stores, such as rebranding acquired locations and environmental liabilities;\n\u2022 managing and expanding our infrastructure to accommodate growth; and\n\u2022 integrating the new stores with our existing buying, distribution and other support operations.\nOur failure to successfully address these challenges could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We opened or acquired 33 stores in fiscal 2013, 39 stores in fiscal 2014 and 18 stores in fiscal 2015. We plan to open at least 22 new stores in fiscal 2016. However, there can be no assurance that we will open the planned number of new stores in fiscal 2016 or thereafter, or that any such stores will be profitable. This expansion will place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources. These increased demands could cause us to operate our existing business less effectively, which in turn could cause the financial performance of our existing stores to deteriorate. In addition, we currently plan to open some new stores within existing markets. Some of these new stores may open close enough to our existing stores that a segment of customers will stop shopping at our existing stores and instead shop at the new stores, causing sales and profitability at those existing stores to decline. If this were to occur with a number of our stores, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to opening new stores, we may acquire stores. Acquiring and integrating stores involves additional risks that could adversely affect our growth and results of operation. Newly acquired stores may be unprofitable and we may incur significant costs and expenses in connection with any acquisition including in remerchandising and rebranding the acquired stores. Integrating newly acquired stores may divert our senior management's attention from our core business. Our ability to integrate newly acquired stores will depend on the successful expansion of our existing financial controls, distribution model, information systems, management and human resources and on attracting, training and retaining qualified employees.\nOur business largely depends on a strong brand image, and if we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand image, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition, we may be unable to increase or maintain our level of sales.\nWe believe that our brand image and brand awareness has contributed significantly to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand image, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition, is important to maintaining and expanding our customer base. Our ability to successfully integrate new stores into their surrounding communities, to expand into new markets or to maintain the strength and distinctiveness of our brand image in our existing markets will be adversely impacted if we fail to connect with our target customers. Maintaining and enhancing our brand image may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as merchandising, marketing, store operations, community relations, store graphics and employee training, which could adversely affect our cash flow and which may ultimately be unsuccessful. Furthermore, our brand image could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality, if we fail to comply with local laws and regulations or if we experience negative publicity or other negative events that affect our image and reputation. Some of these risks may be beyond our ability to control, such as the effects of negative publicity regarding our suppliers. Failure to successfully market and maintain our brand image in new and existing markets could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to adapt to new challenges that arise when expanding into new geographic markets could adversely affect our ability to profitably operate those stores and maintain our brand image.\nOur expansion into new geographic markets could result in competitive, merchandising, distribution and other challenges that are different from those we encounter in the geographic markets in which we currently operate. In addition, as the number of our stores increases, we may face risks associated with market saturation of our product offerings and locations. Our suppliers may also\nrestrict their sales to us in new markets to the extent they are already saturating that market with their products through other retailers or their own stores. There can be no assurance that any newly opened stores will be received as well as, or achieve net sales or profitability levels comparable to those of, our existing stores in the time periods estimated by us, or at all. If our stores fail to achieve, or are unable to sustain, acceptable net sales and profitability levels, our business may be materially harmed, we may incur significant costs associated with closing those stores and our brand image may be negatively impacted.\nWe face intense competition in our industry and we may be unable to compete effectively.\nThe retail industry for western and work wear is highly fragmented and characterized by primarily regional competitors. We estimate that there are thousands of independent specialty stores scattered across the country. We believe that we compete primarily with smaller regional chains and independents on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, price, customer service and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer demand. However, we also compete with farm supply stores, online retailers and, to a lesser degree, mass merchants. Competition with some or all of these retailers could require us to lower our prices or risk losing customers. In addition, significant or unusual promotional activities by our competitors may force us to respond in-kind and adversely impact our operating cash flow. As a result of these factors, current and future competition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of the mass merchants that sell some western or work wear products have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we currently do, and therefore may be able to devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of these products, generate national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage if they decide to expand their offerings of these product lines. Moreover, we do not possess exclusive rights to many of the elements that comprise our in-store experience and product offerings. Our competitors may seek to emulate facets of our business strategy and in-store experience, which could result in a reduction of some competitive advantages or special appeal that we might possess. In addition, most of our suppliers sell products to us on a non-exclusive basis. As a result, our current and future competitors may be able to duplicate or improve on some or all of the product offerings that we believe are important in differentiating our stores and our customers' shopping experience. If our competitors were to duplicate or improve on some or all of our in-store experience or product offerings, our competitive position and our business could suffer.\nWe depend on cash generated from our existing store operations to support our growth, which could strain our cash flow.\nWe primarily rely on cash flow generated from existing stores to fund our current operations and our growth. It typically takes several months and a significant amount of cash to open a new store. For example, our new store model requires an average net cash investment of approximately $0.8 million. If we continue to open a large number of stores relatively close in time, the cost of these store openings and the cost of continuing operations could reduce our cash position. An increase in our net cash outflow for new stores could adversely affect our operations by reducing the amount of cash available to address other aspects of our business.\nIn addition, as we expand our business, we will need significant amounts of cash from operations to pay our existing and future lease obligations, build out new store space, purchase inventory, pay personnel, pay for the increased costs associated with operating as a public company and, if necessary, further invest in our infrastructure and facilities. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund these activities, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available from our new credit facility or future credit facilities, we may need additional equity or debt financing. If such financing is not available to us on satisfactory terms, our ability to operate and expand our business or\nto respond to competitive pressures would be limited and we could be required to delay, curtail or eliminate planned store openings. Moreover, if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, your ownership may be diluted. Any debt financing we may incur may impose covenants that restrict our operations, and will require interest payments that would create additional cash demands and financial risk for us.\nWe have expanded rapidly in recent years and have limited operating experience at our current size.\nWe have significantly expanded our operations in the last three years, increasing our locations from 85 stores in eight states as of March 31, 2012 to 169 stores in 26 states as of March 28, 2015. If our operations continue to grow, we will be required to expand our sales, marketing and support services and our administrative personnel, and we may decide to change our distribution model. This expansion could increase the strain on our existing resources, causing operational difficulties such as difficulties in hiring, obtaining adequate levels of merchandise, delayed shipments and decreased levels of customer service. These difficulties could cause our brand image to deteriorate and lead to a decrease in our revenues and income and the price of our common stock.\nAny significant change in our distribution model could initially have an adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations.\nDuring fiscal 2015, our suppliers shipped approximately 91% of our in-store merchandise units directly to our stores and approximately 46% of our e-commerce merchandise units directly to our e-commerce customers. In the future, as part of our long-term strategic planning, we may change our distribution model to increase the amount of merchandise that we self-distribute through a centralized distribution center. We recently hired a leading supply chain consulting firm to study our current network, supplier structure and likely sources of growth and to recommend an optimal distribution model for our future operations. Changing our distribution model to increase distributions from a centralized distribution center to our stores and customers would initially involve significant capital expenditures, which would increase our borrowings and interest expense or temporarily reduce the rate at which we open new stores. In addition, if we are unable to successfully integrate a new distribution model into our operations in a timely manner, our supply chain could experience significant disruptions, which could reduce our sales and adversely impact our results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain good relationships with our suppliers or if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to provide us with sufficient quantities of merchandise at acceptable prices, our business and operations may be adversely affected.\nOur business is largely dependent on continued good relationships with our suppliers, including suppliers for our third-party branded products and manufacturers for our private brand products. During fiscal 2015, merchandise purchased from our top three suppliers accounted for approximately 20%, 10% and 10% of our sales. We operate on a purchase order basis for our private brand and third-party branded merchandise and do not have long-term written agreements with our suppliers. Accordingly, our suppliers can refuse to sell us merchandise, limit the type or quantity of merchandise that they sell to us, enter into exclusivity arrangements with our competitors or raise prices at any time, which could have an adverse impact on our business. Deterioration in our relationships with our suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our business, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on terms acceptable to us in the future. Also, some of our suppliers sell products directly from their own retail stores or e-commerce websites, and therefore directly compete with us. These suppliers may decide at some point in the future to discontinue supplying their merchandise to us, supply us less desirable merchandise or raise prices on the products they do sell us. If we lose key suppliers and are unable to find alternative\nsuppliers to provide us with substitute merchandise for lost products, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur plans to improve and expand our exclusive product offerings may be unsuccessful, and implementing these plans may divert our operational, managerial, financial and administrative resources, which could harm our competitive position and reduce our revenue and profitability.\nIn addition to our store expansion strategy, we currently plan to grow our business by improving and expanding our exclusive product offerings, which includes introducing new brands and growing and expanding our existing brands. The principal risks to our ability to successfully carry out our plans to improve and expand our product offering are that:\n\u2022 introduction of new products may be delayed, which may allow our competitors to introduce similar products in a more timely fashion, which could hinder our ability to be viewed as the exclusive provider of certain western and work apparel brands and items;\n\u2022 the third-party suppliers of our exclusive product offerings may not maintain adequate controls with respect to product specifications and quality, which may lead to costly corrective action and damage to our brand image;\n\u2022 if our expanded exclusive product offerings fail to maintain and enhance our distinctive brand identity, our brand image may be diminished and our sales may decrease; and\n\u2022 implementation of these plans may divert our management's attention from other aspects of our business and place a strain on our operational, managerial, financial and administrative resources, as well as our information systems.\nIn addition, our ability to successfully improve and expand our exclusive product offerings may be affected by economic and competitive conditions, changes in consumer spending patterns and changes in consumer preferences. These plans could be abandoned, cost more than anticipated and divert resources from other areas of our business, any of which could impact our competitive position and reduce our revenue and profitability.\nAny inability to balance our private brand merchandise with the third-party branded merchandise that we sell may have an adverse effect on our net sales and gross margin.\nOur private brand merchandise represented approximately 10% of our net sales in fiscal 2015. Our private brand merchandise generally has a higher gross margin than the third-party branded merchandise that we offer. As a result, we intend to attempt to increase the penetration of our private brands in the future. However, carrying our private brands limits the amount of third-party branded merchandise we can carry and, therefore, there is a risk that our customers' perception that we offer many major brands will decline or that our suppliers of third-party branded merchandise may decide to discontinue supplying, or reduce the supply of, their merchandise. If this occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on net sales and profitability.\nWe purchase merchandise based on sales projections and our purchase of too much or too little inventory may adversely affect our overall profitability.\nWe must actively manage our purchase of inventory. We generally order our seasonal and private brand merchandise several months in advance of it being received and offered for sale. If there is a significant decrease in demand for these products or if we fail to accurately predict consumer demand, including by disproportionately increasing the penetration of our private brand merchandise, we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess inventory. This could have an adverse effect on our margins and operating income. Conversely, if we fail to purchase a sufficient quantity of merchandise, we may not have an adequate supply of products to meet consumer demand,\nthereby causing us to lose sales or adversely affecting our customer relationships. Any failure on our part to anticipate, identify and respond effectively to changing consumer demand and consumer shopping preferences could adversely affect our results of operations.\nA rise in the cost of fabrics and raw materials or the cost of labor and transportation could increase our cost of merchandise and cause our results of operations and margins to decline.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of fabrics and raw materials, such as cotton and leather, that our suppliers use to manufacture our products, as well as the cost of labor and transportation, could have adverse impacts on our cost of merchandise and our ability to meet our customers' demands. In particular, because key components of our products are cotton and leather, any increases in the cost of cotton or leather may significantly affect the cost of our products and could have an adverse impact on our cost of merchandise. We may be unable to pass all or any of these higher costs on to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nMost of our merchandise is produced in foreign countries, making the price and availability of our merchandise susceptible to international trade risks and other international conditions.\nMany of our private brand products are manufactured in foreign countries. In addition, we purchase most of our third-party branded merchandise from domestic suppliers that have a majority of their merchandise made in foreign countries. Some foreign countries can be, and have been, affected by political and economic instability, public health emergencies and natural disasters, negatively impacting trade. The countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future could become subject to trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or other foreign governments. Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes and customs restrictions, against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our merchandise supply could be impacted if our suppliers' imports become subject to existing or future duties and quotas, or if our suppliers face increased competition from other companies for production facilities, import quota capacity or shipping capacity. Any increase in the cost of our merchandise or limitation on the amount of merchandise we are able to purchase could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, there is a risk that our suppliers could fail to comply with applicable regulations, which could lead to investigations by U.S. or foreign government agencies responsible for international trade compliance. Resulting penalties or enforcement actions could delay future imports or exports or otherwise negatively affect our business.\nIf our suppliers and manufacturers fail to use acceptable labor or other practices, our reputation may be harmed, which could negatively impact our business.\nWe purchase merchandise from independent third-party suppliers and manufacturers. If any of these suppliers have practices that are not legal or accepted in the U.S., consumers may develop a negative view of us, our brand image could be damaged and we could become the subject of boycotts by our customers or interest groups. Further, if the suppliers violate labor or other laws of their own country, these violations could cause disruptions or delays in their shipments of merchandise. For example, much of our merchandise is manufactured in China and Mexico, which have different labor practices than the U.S. We do not independently investigate whether our suppliers are operating in compliance with all applicable laws and therefore we rely upon the suppliers' representations set forth in our purchase orders and supplier agreements concerning the suppliers' compliance with such laws. If our goods are manufactured using illegal or unacceptable labor practices in these countries, or other countries from which our suppliers source the products we purchase, our ability to supply merchandise\nfor our stores without interruption, our brand image and, consequently, our sales may be adversely affected.\nIf we lose key management personnel, our operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe depend upon the leadership and experience of our executive management team. If we are unable to retain existing management personnel who are critical to our success, it could result in harm to our supplier and employee relationships, the loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. The loss of the services of any of our key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, and could be viewed negatively by investors and analysts, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. We may be unable to find qualified individuals to replace key management personnel on a timely basis, without incurring increased costs or at all. We do not intend to purchase key person life insurance covering any employee. If we lose the services of any of our key management personnel or we are unable to attract additional qualified personnel, we may be unable to successfully manage our business.\nIf we cannot attract, train and retain qualified employees, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends upon the quality of the employees we hire. We recruit people who are welcoming, friendly and service-oriented, and who often live the western lifestyle or have a genuine affinity for it. Employees in many positions must have knowledge of our merchandise and the skill necessary to excel in a customer service environment. The turnover rate in the retail industry is typically high and finding qualified candidates to fill positions may be difficult. Our planned growth will require us to hire and train even more personnel. If we cannot attract, train and retain corporate employees, district managers, store managers and store associates with the qualifications we deem necessary, our ability to effectively operate and expand may be adversely affected. In addition, we rely on temporary and seasonal personnel to staff our distribution center. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to find adequate temporary or seasonal personnel to staff our operations when needed, which may strain our existing personnel and negatively impact our operations.\nThe concentration of our stores and operations in certain geographic locations subjects us to regional economic conditions and natural disasters that could adversely affect our business.\nOur corporate headquarters and distribution center are in a single location in Irvine, California. If we encounter any disruptions to our operations at this building or if it were to shut down for any reason, including due to fire or other natural disaster, then we may be prevented from effectively operating our stores and our e-commerce business. Furthermore, the risk of disruption or shutdown at this building is greater than it might be if it were located in another region, as southern California is prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes and wildfires. Any disruption or shutdown at this location could significantly impact our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, most of the 169 stores that we operated as of March 28, 2015 were concentrated in the western U.S., with 81 of those stores located in Arizona, California and Texas. The geographic concentration of our stores may expose us to economic downturns in those states where our stores are located. For example, a recession in any area where we own several stores could adversely affect our ability to generate or increase operating revenues. In addition, our stores located in North Dakota and surrounding areas are likely to be adversely impacted by the recent economic downturn affecting the oil and gas industry. Any negative impact upon or disruption to the operations of stores in these states could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to make significant lease payments for our stores, corporate headquarters and distribution center, which may strain our cash flow.\nWe do not own any real estate. Instead, we lease all of our retail store locations as well as our corporate headquarters and distribution center. The store leases generally have a base lease term of five or 10 years, with multiple renewal periods of five years, on average, exercisable at our option. Many of our leases have early cancelation clauses which permit us to terminate the lease if certain sales thresholds are not met in certain periods of time. Our costs under these leases are a significant amount of our expenses and are growing rapidly as we expand the number of locations and the cost of leasing existing locations rises. In fiscal 2015, our total operating lease expense was $27.3 million, and we expect this amount to continue to increase as we open more stores. We are required to pay additional rent under many of our lease agreements based upon achieving certain sales thresholds for each store location. We are generally responsible for the payment of property taxes and insurance, utilities and common area maintenance fees. Many of our lease agreements also contain provisions which increase the rent payments on a set time schedule, causing the cash rent paid for a location to escalate over the term of the lease. In addition, rent costs could escalate when multi-year leases are renewed at the expiration of their lease term. These costs are significant, recurring and increasing, which places a consistent strain on our cash flow.\nWe depend on cash flows from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under our new credit facility, future credit facilities or from other sources, we may be unable to service our operating lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or to fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would harm our business.\nAdditional sites that we lease are likely to be subject to similar long-term leases. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. We may fail to identify suitable store locations, the availability of which is beyond our control, to replace such closed stores. In addition, as our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations. Seventeen of our 169 store leases will reach their termination date during fiscal 2016, and none of these leases contain an option to automatically extend the lease term. If we are unable to enter into new leases or renew existing leases on terms acceptable to us or be released from our obligations under leases for stores that we close, our business, profitability and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe may be unable to maintain same store sales or net sales per square foot, which may cause our results of operations to decline.\nThe investing public may use same store sales or net sales per square foot projections or results, over a certain period of time, such as on a quarterly or yearly basis, as an indicator of our profitability growth. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation for further discussion of \"same store sales\". Our same store sales can vary significantly from period to period for a variety of reasons, such as the age of stores, changing economic factors, unseasonable weather, pricing, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events and increased competition. These factors could cause same store sales or net sales per square foot to decline period to period or fail to grow at expected rates, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cause the price of our common stock to be volatile during such periods.\nIf our management information systems fail to operate or are unable to support our growth, our operations could be disrupted.\nWe rely upon our management information systems in almost every aspect of our daily business operations. For example, our management information systems serve an integral part in enabling us to order merchandise, process merchandise at our distribution center and retail stores, perform and track sales transactions, manage personnel, pay suppliers and employees, operate our e-commerce business and report financial and accounting information to management. In addition, we rely on our management information systems to enable us to leverage our costs as we grow. If our management information systems fail to operate or are unable to support our growth, our store operations and e-commerce business could be severely disrupted, and we could be required to make significant additional expenditures to remediate any such failure.\nWe rely on UPS and the United States Postal Service to deliver our e-commerce merchandise to our customers and our business could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the operations of these third-party service providers.\nWe rely on UPS and the United States Postal Service to deliver our e-commerce merchandise to our customers. Relying on these third-party delivery services puts us at risk from disruptions in their operations, such as employee strikes, inclement weather and their inability to meet our shipping demands. If we are forced to use other delivery services, our costs could increase and we may be unable to meet shipment deadlines. Moreover, we may be unable to obtain terms as favorable as those received from the transportation providers we currently use, which would further increase our costs. In addition, if our products are not delivered to our customers on time, our customers may cancel their orders or we may lose business from these customers in the future. These circumstances may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nUse of social media may adversely impact our reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties.\nThere has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms, including blogs, social media websites and other forms of Internet-based communication, which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Negative commentary regarding us or the brands that we sell may be posted on social media platforms or similar devices at any time and may harm our reputation or business. Consumers value readily available information concerning retailers and their goods and services and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. In addition, social media platforms provide users with access to such a broad audience that collective action against our stores, such as boycotts, can be more easily organized. If such actions were organized, we could suffer reputational damage as well as physical damage to our stores and merchandise.\nWe also use social media platforms as marketing tools. For example, we maintain Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts. As laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices, the failure by us, our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations or subject us to fines or other penalties.\nOur e-commerce business subjects us to numerous risks that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur e-commerce business and its continued growth subject us to certain risks that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, including:\n\u2022 diversion of traffic from our stores;\n\u2022 liability for online content;\n\u2022 government regulation of the Internet; and\n\u2022 risks related to the computer systems that operate our e-commerce website and related support systems, including computer viruses, electronic data theft and similar disruptions.\nIn addition, as we expand our e-commerce operations, we face the risk of increased losses from credit card fraud. We do not carry insurance against the risk of credit card fraud, so under current credit card practices, we may be liable for fraudulent credit card transactions even though the associated financial institution has approved payment of the orders. If we are unable to deter or control credit card fraud, or if credit card companies require more burdensome terms or refuse to accept credit card charges from us, our net income could be reduced. A breach of our e-commerce security measures could also reduce demand for our services.\nOur sales can significantly fluctuate based upon shopping seasons, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate disproportionately on a quarterly basis.\nBecause of a traditionally higher level of sales during the Christmas shopping season, our sales are typically higher in the third fiscal quarter than they are in the other fiscal quarters. We also incur significant additional costs and expenses during our third fiscal quarter due to increased staffing levels and higher purchase volumes. Accordingly, the results of a single fiscal quarter should not be relied on as an indication of our annual results or future performance. In addition, any factors that harm our third fiscal quarter operating results could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year.\nWe buy and stock merchandise based upon seasonal weather patterns and therefore unseasonable or extreme weather could negatively impact our sales, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe buy and stock merchandise for sale based upon expected seasonal weather patterns. If we encounter unseasonable weather, such as warmer winters or cooler summers than would be considered typical, these weather variations could cause some of our merchandise to be inconsistent with what consumers wish to purchase, causing our sales to decline. In addition, weather conditions affect the demand for our products, which in turn has an impact on prices. In past years, weather conditions, including unseasonably warm weather in winter months, and extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme rain and droughts, have affected our sales and results of operations both positively and negatively. Furthermore, extended unseasonable weather conditions in the western U.S., particularly in California, will likely have a greater impact on our sales because of our store concentration in that region. Our strategy is to remain flexible and to react to unseasonable and extreme weather conditions by adjusting our merchandise assortments and redirecting inventories to stores affected by the weather conditions. Should such a strategy not be effective, unseasonable or extreme weather may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to obtain and retain high-visibility sponsorship or endorsement arrangements with celebrities, or if the reputation of any of the celebrities that we partner with is impaired, our business may suffer.\nA principal component of our marketing program is to partner with well-known country music artists and other celebrities for sponsorship and endorsement arrangements. Although we have partnered with several well-known celebrities in this manner, some of these persons may not continue their endorsements, may not continue to succeed in their fields or may engage in activities which could bring disrepute on themselves and, in turn, on us and our brand image and products. We also may not be able to attract and partner with new celebrities that may emerge in the future. Competition for endorsers is significant and adverse publicity regarding us or our industry could make it more difficult to attract and retain endorsers. Any of these failures by us or the celebrities that we partner with could adversely affect our business and revenues.\nOur internal operations or management information systems could be disrupted by system security failures, cyber threats or by the failure of, or lack of access to, our Enterprise Resource Planning system. These disruptions could negatively impact our sales, increase our expenses, harm our reputation and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nHackers, computer programmers and internal users may be able to penetrate our network security and create system disruptions, cause shutdowns and misappropriate our confidential information or that of our employees and third parties, including our customers. Therefore, we could incur significant expenses addressing problems created by security breaches to our network. This risk is heightened because we collect and store customer information for marketing purposes, as well as debit and credit card information. We must, and do, take precautions to secure customer information and prevent unauthorized access to our database of confidential information. However, if unauthorized parties, including external hackers or computer programmers, gain access to our database, they may be able to steal this confidential information. Our failure to secure this information could result in costly litigation, adverse publicity or regulatory action, or result in customers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores, or customers not shopping in our stores or on our e-commerce website altogether. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture that could unexpectedly interfere with our operations. The cost to alleviate security risks and defects in software and hardware and to address any problems that occur could negatively impact our sales, distribution and other critical functions, as well as our financial results.\nWe operate our Enterprise Resource Planning system on a software-as-a-service platform, and we use this system for integrated point-of-sale, merchandising, planning, sales audit, customer relationship management, inventory control, loss prevention, purchase order management and business intelligence. Accordingly, we depend on this system, and the third-party provider of this service, for many aspects of our operations. If this service provider or this system fails, or if we are unable to continue to have access to this system on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, our operations would be severely disrupted until an equivalent system could be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated into our operations. This disruption would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our financial results may be negatively impacted.\nOur success depends in large part on our brand image. Our name, logo, domain name and our private brands and other intellectual property are valuable assets that differentiate us from our competitors. We currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade dress and unfair competition laws to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, but the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation and misappropriation of our brand. Additional obstacles may arise as we expand our product lines and geographic scope. Moreover, litigation may be necessary to protect or enforce these intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The unauthorized use or misappropriation of our intellectual property or our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could damage our brand image and the goodwill we have created, which could cause our sales to decline.\nWe have not registered any of our intellectual property outside of the U.S. and cannot prohibit other companies from using our trademarks in foreign countries. Use of our trademarks in foreign countries could negatively impact our identity in the U.S. and cause our sales to decline.\nWe may be subject to liability if we, or our suppliers, infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe may be subject to claims that our activities or the products that we sell infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Any such claims can be time consuming and costly to defend, and may divert our management's attention and resources, even if the claims are meritless. If we were to be found liable for any such infringement, we could be required to enter into costly settlements or license agreements and could be subject to injunctions preventing further infringement. Such infringement claims could harm our brand image. In addition, any payments that we are required to make and any injunction with which we are required to comply as a result of such infringement actions could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe purchase merchandise from suppliers that may be subject to design copyrights or design patents, or otherwise may incorporate protected intellectual property. We are not involved in the manufacture of any of the merchandise we purchase from our suppliers for sale to our customers, and we do not independently investigate whether these suppliers legally hold intellectual property rights to merchandise that they are manufacturing or distributing. As a result, we rely upon the suppliers' representations set forth in our purchase orders and supplier agreements concerning their right to sell us the products that we purchase from them. If a third party claims to have licensing rights with respect to merchandise we purchased from a supplier, or if we acquire unlicensed merchandise, we could be obligated to remove such merchandise from our stores, incur costs associated with destruction of such merchandise if the distributor or supplier is unwilling or unable to reimburse us and be subject to liability under various civil and criminal causes of action, including actions to recover unpaid royalties and other damages and injunctions. Any of these results could harm our brand image and have a material adverse effect on our business and growth.\nThe terms of our credit facility may restrict our current and future operations, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and to manage our operations.\nOur credit facility contains, and any additional debt financing we may incur would likely contain, covenants requiring us to maintain or adhere to certain financial ratios or limits and covenants that restrict our operations, which include limitations on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 create liens on property;\n\u2022 engage in mergers, consolidations and other fundamental changes;\n\u2022 dispose of assets;\n\u2022 make investments, loans or advances;\n\u2022 make certain acquisitions;\n\u2022 engage in certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 declare or pay dividends on, or repurchase, our stock; and\n\u2022 change our lines of business or fiscal year.\nComplying with these covenants could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations. In addition, these covenants could affect our ability to invest capital in our new stores and fund capital expenditures for existing stores. Our ability to comply with these covenants and other provisions in our new credit facility and any future credit facilities or debt instruments may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance, changes in general business and economic conditions, adverse regulatory developments or other events beyond our control.\nA failure by us to comply with the financial ratios and restrictive covenants contained in our new credit facility and any future credit facilities or debt instruments could result in an event of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be due and payable and exercise other remedies as set forth in our new credit facility and any future credit facilities or debt instruments. In addition, if we are in default, we may be unable to borrow additional amounts under any such facilities to the extent that they would otherwise be available and our ability to obtain future financing may also be impacted negatively. If the indebtedness under our new credit facility and any future credit facilities or debt instruments were to be accelerated, it would have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition.\nLitigation costs and the outcome of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is characterized by a high volume of customer traffic and by transactions involving a wide variety of product selections, each of which exposes us to a higher risk of consumer litigation than companies operating in other industries. From time to time we may be subject to litigation claims through the ordinary course of our business operations regarding, but not limited to, employment matters, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, footwear, apparel and accessory safety standards, security of customer and employee personal information, contractual relations with suppliers, marketing and infringement of trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Litigation to defend ourselves against claims by third parties, or to enforce any rights that we may have against third parties, may be necessary, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nUnion attempts to organize our employees could negatively affect our business.\nCurrently, none of our employees are represented by a union. However, if some or all of our workforce were to unionize and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could increase our costs and adversely impact our profitability. Moreover, participation in labor unions could put us at increased risk of labor strikes and disruption of our operations. Responding to unionization attempts may distract management and our workforce. Any of these changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nViolations of or changes in laws, including employment laws and laws related to our merchandise, could make conducting our business more expensive or change the way we do business.\nWe are subject to numerous regulations, including labor and employment, customs, truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, environmental and occupational safety requirements and zoning and occupancy laws and ordinances that regulate retailers generally, that govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and/or that regulate the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. If these regulations were violated by our management, employees or suppliers, the costs of certain goods could increase, or we could experience delays in shipments of our goods, be subject to fines or penalties or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and hurt our business and results of operations.\nSimilarly, changes in laws could make operating our business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business. For example, changes in laws related to employee health care, hours, wages, job classifications and benefits could significantly increase operating costs. In addition, changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs for certain merchandise, or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale. It may be difficult for us to foresee regulatory changes impacting our business and our actions needed to respond to changes in the law could be costly and may negatively impact our operations.\nHealth care reform could adversely affect our business.\nThe enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as well as other health care reform legislation considered by Congress and state legislatures, could significantly impact our health care cost structure and increase our health care-related expenses. We expect that we will be required to modify our programs and operations in future fiscal years as a result of health care reform legislation. If we cannot effectively modify our programs and operations in response to the new legislation, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions that could negatively impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management.\nWe have made strategic acquisitions in the past and may in the future consider strategic transactions and business arrangements, including, but not limited to, acquisitions, asset purchases, partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures and investments. The success of such a transaction is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation, operations, growth potential, integration and other factors relating to the respective business. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities. We may be unable to successfully integrate operations that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could harm our operations and financial results.\nTerrorism or civil unrest could negatively affect our business.\nTerrorist attacks, threats of terrorist attacks or civil unrest involving public areas could cause people to avoid visiting some areas where our stores are located. Further, armed conflicts or acts of war throughout the world may create uncertainty, causing consumers to spend less on discretionary purchases, including on footwear, apparel and accessories, or disrupt our ability to obtain merchandise for our stores. Such decreases in consumer spending or disruptions in our ability to obtain merchandise would likely decrease our sales and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. Our goodwill balance as of March 28, 2015 of $93.1 million was generated by the initial acquisition of Boot Barn Holding Corporation and the subsequent acquisitions of RCC and Baskins. Our indefinite lived intangible asset balance as of March 28, 2015 was $50.1 million. We test goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets are considered to be impaired when the net book value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. No impairment losses have been recorded in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. However, an impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related To Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market for specialty retail stocks can be highly volatile. Prior to the initial public offering of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock, there had been no public market for our stock. Shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in October 2014 at a price of $16.00 per share. From October 30, 2014 to March 28, 2015, our common stock has traded as high as $25.50 and as low as $16.88. An active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our common stock or cause it to be highly volatile or subject to wide fluctuations. The market price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate or may decline significantly in the future and you could lose all or part of your investment. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u2022 variations in our quarterly or annual financial results and operating performance and the performance of our competitors;\n\u2022 publication of research reports or recommendations by securities or industry analysts about us, our competitors or our industry, or a lack of such securities analyst coverage;\n\u2022 our failure or our competitors' failure to meet analysts' projections or guidance;\n\u2022 ratings downgrades by any securities analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u2022 our levels of same store sales;\n\u2022 sales or anticipated sales of large blocks of our common stock;\n\u2022 changes to our management team;\n\u2022 regulatory developments negatively affecting our industry;\n\u2022 changes in stock market valuations of our competitors;\n\u2022 the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock;\n\u2022 the public's response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022 the performance and successful integration of any new stores that we open or acquire;\n\u2022 actions by competitors;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of new product offerings or significant acquisitions;\n\u2022 short selling of our common stock by investors;\n\u2022 limited \"public float\" in the hands of a small number of persons whose sales or lack of sales of our common stock could result in positive or negative pricing pressure on the market price for our common stock;\n\u2022 fluctuations in the stock markets generally; and\n\u2022 changes in general market and economic conditions.\nFurther, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation, should it materialize, could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources, and could also require us to\nmake substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation. The threat or filing of class action litigation could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nFreeman Spogli & Co. holds a significant amount of our common stock, which may prevent other stockholders from influencing corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest that cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nFreeman Spogli & Co. controls approximately 48.1% of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, Freeman Spogli & Co. is in a position to dictate, or significantly influence, the outcome of any corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and mergers, acquisitions and other significant corporate transactions. Freeman Spogli & Co., acting alone or in conjunction with other stockholders, may be able to delay or prevent a change of control from occurring, even if the change of control would benefit our stockholders. It is also possible that the interests of Freeman Spogli & Co. may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of our stockholders. This ownership concentration may adversely impact the trading of our common stock because of a perceived conflict of interest that may exist, thereby depressing the value of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions renouncing our interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities identified by or presented to Freeman Spogli & Co.\nFreeman Spogli & Co. and its affiliates are in the business of providing capital to growing companies, and they may acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that Freeman Spogli & Co. and its affiliates will not have any duty to refrain from (1) engaging, directly or indirectly, in our line of business or (2) doing business with any of our customers or suppliers. In the event that Freeman Spogli & Co. or its affiliates (other than in the capacity as one of our officers or directors) acquires knowledge of a potential business opportunity which may be a corporate opportunity for us, then Freeman Spogli & Co. does not have any duty to communicate or offer such business opportunity to us and may take any such opportunity for itself or offer it to another person. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that Freeman Spogli & Co. and its officers, directors and employees will not be liable to us or to any of our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary or other duty by engaging in any such activity and we will waive and renounce any claim based on such activity. This provision applies even if the business opportunity is one that we might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects if attractive business opportunities are allocated by Freeman Spogli & Co. to itself or its other affiliates instead of to us.\nFuture sales of our common stock by existing stockholders could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nThe market price for our common stock may decline as a result of sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market after this offering, or the perception that such sales might occur. As of May 27, 2015, we had 25,824,100 shares of common stock outstanding. Each of our executive officers and directors and the selling stockholders have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, to be bound by a lock-up agreement that prevents us and them from selling or transferring shares of our common stock until May 27, 2015. However, these shares will be freely tradable, subject to the limitations of Rule 144, in the public markets after the expiration of the lock-up period, which could depress the value of our common stock. Moreover, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Piper Jaffray & Co. and Jefferies LLC may, in their sole discretion, release any of the shares held by our executive officers or directors or other current stockholders from the restrictions of the lock-up agreement at any time\nwithout notice, which would allow the immediate sale of these shares in the market, subject to the limitations of Rule 144.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our corporate organizational documents and new credit facility and under Delaware law may delay, deter or prevent a takeover of us and the replacement or removal of our management, even if such a change of control would benefit our stockholders.\nThe anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, as well as the provisions contained in our corporate organizational documents, may make an acquisition of us more difficult. For example:\n\u2022 our amended and restated certificate of incorporation includes a provision authorizing our board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock without stockholder approval, which, if issued, would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and make it more difficult for a stockholder to acquire us;\n\u2022 our amended and restated bylaws provide that director vacancies and newly created directorships can only be filled by an affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office;\n\u2022 our amended and restated bylaws require advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations;\n\u2022 our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors may adopt, amend, add to, modify or repeal our amended and restated bylaws without stockholder approval;\n\u2022 our amended and restated bylaws do not permit our stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting unless that action is taken with regard to a matter that has been approved by our board of directors or requires the approval only of certain classes or series of our stock;\n\u2022 our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a requirement that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, certain proceedings against or involving us or our directors, officers or employees must be brought exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum;\n\u2022 our amended and restated bylaws do not permit our stockholders to call special meetings; and\n\u2022 the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL, may prevent any stockholder or group of stockholders owning at least 15% of our common stock from completing a merger or acquisition of us.\nOur debt instruments also contain provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult or less attractive for a third party to acquire control of us. Our new credit facility provides that a change of control constitutes an event of default under such credit facility and would permit the lenders to declare the indebtedness incurred thereunder to be immediately due and payable. Our future credit facilities may contain similar provisions. The need to repay all such indebtedness may deter potential third parties from acquiring us.\nUnder these various provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and new credit facility, a takeover attempt or third-party acquisition of us, including a takeover attempt that may result in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock, could be delayed, deterred or prevented. In addition, these provisions may prevent the market price of our common stock from increasing in response to actual or rumored takeover attempts and may also prevent changes in our management. As a result, these anti-takeover and change of control provisions may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur failure to maintain adequate internal controls over our financial and management systems may cause errors in our financial reporting. These errors may cause a loss of investor confidence and result in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nOur public company reporting obligations and our anticipated growth may place additional burdens on our financial and management systems, internal controls and employees. In addition, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which we refer to as Section 404, we are required to complete the process of documentation currently underway, and the testing of our internal controls so that our management can certify the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting by the time our annual report for fiscal 2016 is due and annually thereafter.\nWe are currently taking the necessary steps to comply with Section 404. However, this process is time consuming and costly. If, during this process, we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls, it is possible that our management may be unable to certify that our internal controls are effective by the certification deadline. We cannot be certain we will be able to successfully complete the implementation and certification requirements of Section 404 within the time period allowed.\nMoreover, if we identify any material weaknesses or deficiencies that aggregate to a material weakness in our internal controls, we will have to implement appropriate changes to these controls, which may require specific compliance training for our directors, officers and employees, require the hiring of additional finance, accounting, legal and other personnel, entail substantial costs to modify our existing accounting systems and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to prevent fraud. As a result, our failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 on a timely basis could result in us being subject to regulatory action and a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, both of which in turn could cause the market value of our common stock to decline and affect our ability to raise capital.\nWe will continue to incur significant expenses as a result of being a publicly traded company, which may negatively impact our earnings.\nAs a public company we incur and expect to continue to incur significant incremental legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses. Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules implemented by the SEC and the stock exchanges required changes to our corporate governance practices that did not apply to us before we became a public company. In addition, the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act require, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. Our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has increased, and will continue to increase, our expenses, including legal and accounting costs, and has made, and will continue to make, some of our operations more costly and time consuming. In addition, it may also be more difficult for us to find and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. Further, any additional expenses in legal, accounting, insurance and other related expenses could reduce our earnings and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research and reports or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research and reports about our business, the price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If securities or industry analyst coverage of one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or\nunfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause the price of our common stock and trading volume to decline.\nWe do not currently intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock, which may make our common stock less desirable to investors and decrease its value.\nWe intend to retain all of our available funds for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, legal requirements and restrictions that may be imposed by the terms of our new credit facility and in any future financing instruments. Therefore, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price increases above the price at which you purchased it, which may never occur.\nWe take advantage and will continue to take advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \"emerging growth companies\", which may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nThe JOBS Act provides that, so long as a company qualifies as an \"emerging growth company\", it will, among other things:\n\u2022 be exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that its independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting;\n\u2022 be exempt from the \"say on pay\" and \"say on golden parachute\" advisory vote requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act;\n\u2022 be exempt from certain disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to compensation of its executive officers and be permitted to omit the detailed compensation discussion and analysis from proxy statements and reports filed under the Exchange Act; and\n\u2022 be permitted to provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation and be exempt from any rules that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotations or a supplement to the auditor's report on the financial statements.\nIf we remain an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of these exemptions. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we elect to rely on these exemptions, or if taking advantage of these exemptions would result in less active trading or more volatility in the price of our common stock. Also, as a result of our taking advantage of some or all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are available to us as long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that fully comply with regulatory and reporting requirements upon the public company effective dates.", "PERMNO": 14953, "SIC": 5661, "TIC": "BOOT"}
