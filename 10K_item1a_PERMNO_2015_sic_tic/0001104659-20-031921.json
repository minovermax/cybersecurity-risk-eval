The following discussion highlights the risks that management believes are material for the Registrant, but does not necessarily include all the risks that we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known or that management does not currently deem material could also have a material adverse impact on our business, results of our operations and financial condition. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose some or all of your investment. You should carefully consider the risk factors and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this Report in evaluating an investment in the Registrant\u2019s common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may experience unexpected credit losses in connection with the loans we make, which could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs a lender, we face the risk that our borrowers will not repay their loans and guarantors or other related parties will also fail to perform in accordance with the loan terms. A borrower\u2019s failure to repay us is usually preceded by missed monthly payments. In some instances, however, a borrower may declare bankruptcy prior to missing payments, and, following a borrower filing bankruptcy, a lender\u2019s recovery of the credit extended is often limited. Since many of our loans are secured by collateral, we may attempt to seize the collateral if and when a borrower defaults on a loan. However, the value of the collateral might not equal the amount of the unpaid loan, and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from our borrower. The resolution of nonperforming assets, including the initiation of foreclosure proceedings, requires significant commitments of time from management, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities, and which expose us to additional legal costs. Elevated levels of loan delinquencies and bankruptcies in our market areas, generally, and among our borrowers specifically, can be precursors of future charge-offs and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. Higher charge-off rates, delays in the foreclosure process or in obtaining judgments against defaulting borrowers or an increase in our allowance for loan losses may negatively impact our overall financial performance, may increase our cost of funds, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur allowance for loan losses may be insufficient and significant loan losses could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses through a charge to earnings.\nTo account for the risk that our borrowers will not repay their loans, we maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a charge to earnings. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; loan loss experience; current loan portfolio quality and trends; present economic, political, and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. We might underestimate the loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio and have loan losses in excess of the amount recorded in our allowance for loan losses. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. There may be a significant increase in the number of borrowers who are unable or unwilling to repay their loans, resulting in our charging off more loans and increasing our allowance. Furthermore, when real estate values decline, the potential severity of loss on a real estate-secured loan can increase significantly, especially in the case of loans with high combined loan-to-value ratios. Downturns in the national economy and the local economies of the areas in which our loans are concentrated could result in an increase in loan delinquencies, foreclosures or repossessions resulting in increased charge-off amounts and the need for additional loan loss provisions in future periods. If charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for probable loan losses; we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n- 19 -\nIn addition, our determination as to the amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by our primary regulators, the FDIC and the Commissioner, as part of their examination process, which may result in the establishment of an additional allowance based upon the judgment of either of these regulators after a review of the information available at the time of their examination. Our allowance for loan losses amounted to $8.3 million and $8.7 million, or 0.81% and 0.88% of total loans outstanding and 69% and 75% of nonperforming loans, at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Item 7 of Part II, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note E to our consolidated financial statements presented under Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K, for further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for probable loan losses.\nAn increase in our nonperforming assets will negatively affect our earnings.\nOur nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on non-accrual loans or other real estate owned. We must reserve for probable losses, which is established through a current period charge to the provision for loan losses, and, from time to time as appropriate, write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to our other real estate owned. Further, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract them from other responsibilities. Finally, if our estimate for the recorded allowance for loan losses proves to be incorrect and our allowance is inadequate, we will have to increase the allowance accordingly, which would decrease our net income and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe geographic concentration of our loan portfolio and lending activities makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy.\nNearly all of our loans are secured by real estate or made to businesses in our market area, which includes portions of central and eastern North Carolina, southeastern Virginia and northwestern South Carolina. As a result of this geographic concentration, our results may correlate to the economic conditions in these areas. Declines in these markets\u2019 economic conditions may adversely affect the quality of our loan portfolio and the demand for our products and services, and accordingly, our results of operations. Adverse conditions in the local economy such as inflation, unemployment, recession or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nA decline in local economic conditions could adversely affect the values of real property used as collateral for our loans. Consequently, a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse. At December 31, 2019, approximately 91.9% of the Bank\u2019s loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. If the value of real estate in our market area were to decline materially, a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under-collateralized and/or cause us to realize a loss in the event of a foreclosure. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected.\n- 20 -\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio consists of loans for commercial real estate and construction, which carry greater historical credit risk than residential mortgage loans.\nWe originate commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans, most often secured by commercial properties and construction loans primarily within our market area. These loans tend to involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers, more complex underlying collateral, and are most susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. These loans also have historically had greater credit risk than residential real estate loans for the following reasons:\n\u00b7 Commercial Real Estate Loans. Repayment is dependent on income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. These loans also involve greater risk because they are generally not fully amortizing over a loan period, but rather have a balloon payment due at maturity. A borrower\u2019s ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to either refinance the loan or timely sell the underlying property. As of December 31, 2019, commercial real estate loans were approximately 44.6% of the Bank\u2019s total loan portfolio.\n\u00b7 Construction Loans. Repayment is dependent on completion of the project and the subsequent financing of the completed project as a commercial real estate or residential real estate loan, and in some instances on the rent or sale of the underlying project. The risk of loss is largely dependent on our initial estimate of whether the property\u2019s value at completion equals or exceeds the cost of property construction and the availability of take-out financing. During the construction phase, a number of factors can result in delays or cost overruns. If our estimate is inaccurate or if actual construction costs exceed estimates, the value of the property securing our loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed through a permanent loan, sale of the property, or by seizure of collateral. As of December 31, 2019, construction loans were approximately 21.6% of the Bank\u2019s total loan portfolio.\n\u00b7 Commercial and Industrial Loans. Repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower\u2019s business. In addition, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, be difficult to appraise, be more difficult to liquidate than residential real estate, or fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. As of December 31, 2019, commercial and industrial loans were approximately 7.4% of the Bank\u2019s total loan portfolio.\nOur commercial real estate loans include both owner and non-owner occupied properties. Non-owner occupied properties expose us to a greater risk of non-payment and loss than loans secured by owner-occupied properties because repayment of such loans depends primarily on the tenant\u2019s continuing ability to pay rent to the property owner, who is our borrower, or, if the property owner is unable to find a tenant, the property owner\u2019s ability to repay the loan without the benefit of a rental income stream, or other events beyond the borrower\u2019s control. In addition, the physical condition of non-owner-occupied properties is often below that of owner-occupied properties due to lax property maintenance standards, which has a negative impact on the value of the collateral properties. Furthermore, some of our non-owner-occupied borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us, which may expose us to a greater risk of loss compared to residential and commercial borrowers with only one loan.\nWe are exposed to risks in connection with residential mortgage loans.\nWe originate fixed and adjustable rate loans secured by one-to-four family residential real estate. As of December 31, 2019, we had $151.7 million in residential mortgage loans, which represented 14.7% of our total loan portfolio. The residential loans in our loan portfolio are sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. Residential loans with high combined loan-to-value ratios generally are more sensitive and may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses. In addition, if the borrowers sell their homes, the borrowers may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale proceeds. As a result, these loans may experience higher rates of delinquencies, defaults and losses, which could in turn adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n- 21 -\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to clients, we may assume that a customer\u2019s audited financial statements conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. Our earnings are significantly affected by our ability to properly originate, underwrite and service loans. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we incorrectly assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers, fail to detect or respond to deterioration in asset quality in a timely manner, or rely on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or are materially misleading.\nWe may be forced to foreclose on the collateral property securing our loans and own the underlying real estate, which may subject us to the increased risks and costs associated with the ownership of real property.\nWe originate loans secured by real estate and from time to time are forced to foreclose on the collateral property to protect our investment and may thereafter own and operate such property, which exposes us to the inherent risks of real property ownership. The amount that we, as a lender, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 general or local economic conditions;\n\u00b7 environmental cleanup liability;\n\u00b7 neighborhood values;\n\u00b7 interest rates;\n\u00b7 real estate tax rates;\n\u00b7 operating expenses of the mortgaged properties;\n\u00b7 supply of and demand for rental units or properties;\n\u00b7 ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties;\n\u00b7 zoning laws;\n\u00b7 governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies; and\n\u00b7 natural or other disasters.\nCertain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes and maintenance costs, may adversely affect the income from the real estate. Therefore, the cost of operating real property may exceed the rental income earned from such property, and we may have to advance funds in order to protect our investment or we may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss. This may result in reduced net income, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n- 22 -\nOur expansion strategy may expose us to additional risks related to our acquisition of other financial institutions.\nOur acquisition of other financial institutions, or parts of other institutions, such as with branch acquisitions, involves a number of risks, including the risk that:\n\u00b7 we may incur substantial costs in identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners, or in evaluating new markets, hiring experienced, local managers, and opening new offices;\n\u00b7 our estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks relating to target institutions may not be accurate;\n\u00b7 the institutions we acquire may have distressed assets and there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the value we predict from those assets or that we will make sufficient provisions or have sufficient capital for future losses;\n\u00b7 we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment, or other charges related to the institutions we acquire that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u00b7 there may be substantial lag-time between completing an acquisition and generating sufficient assets and deposits to support costs of the expansion;\n\u00b7 our management\u2019s attention in negotiating a transaction and integrating the operations and personnel of the combining businesses may be diverted from our existing business and we may not be able to successfully integrate such operations and personnel;\n\u00b7 we may enter new markets where we lack local experience or that introduce new risks to our operations, or that otherwise result in adverse effects on our results of operations;\n\u00b7 we may introduce new products and services we are not equipped to manage or that introduce new risks to our operations, or that otherwise result in adverse effects on our results of operations;\n\u00b7 we may incur intangible assets in connection with an acquisition, or the intangible assets we incur may become impaired, which could result in adverse short-term effects on our results of operations;\n\u00b7 we may assume liabilities in connection with an acquisition, including unrecorded liabilities that are not discovered at the time of the transaction, and the repayment of those liabilities may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and stock price; or\n\u00b7 we may lose key employees and customers that were part of the reason we pursued an acquisition.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate any banks or banking offices that we acquire into our operations or retain the customers that we acquire in any acquisition. If any of these risks occur in connection with our expansion efforts, it may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face additional risk of litigation due to our acquisition strategy.\nIn addition to the ordinary risk of litigation that we face in connection with our day-to-day banking activities, we also face litigation risk in connection with our strategy to grow through acquisition of other financial institutions or parts of other institutions, such as with branch acquisitions. The Company, as well as our directors and officers and the companies we seek to acquire, may face claims from shareholders related to transaction disclosures or alleged breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with entering into such acquisition transactions. The defense or settlement of any such lawsuit or claims, or the delay that any such lawsuit may cause on the strategic acquisitions that we pursue, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to environmental liability associated with our lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on nonresidential real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n- 23 -\nChanges in interest rates affect our profitability and the value of our interest-earning assets.\nThe Bank derives its income primarily from the difference or \u201cspread\u201d between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, and interest paid on deposits, borrowed funds and other interest-bearing liabilities. In general, the larger the spread, the more the Bank earns. When market rates of interest change, the interest the Bank receives on its assets and the interest the Bank pays on its liabilities will fluctuate. Changes in market interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread and, as a result, our net interest income. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our interest rate spread to expand or contract. Our liabilities are shorter in duration than our assets, so they will adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates. As a result, when interest rates rise, our funding costs generally will rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets, causing our interest rate spread to contract until the yield catches up. Changes in the slope of the \u201cyield curve\u201d-or the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates-will also reduce our interest rate spread. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates. Because our liabilities are shorter in duration than our assets, when the yield curve flattens or even inverts, we will experience pressure on our interest rate spread as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets. In addition, our mortgage banking income is sensitive to changes in interest rates. During periods of rising and relatively higher interest rates, mortgage originations for purchased homes can decline considerably and refinanced mortgage activity can severely decrease. During periods of falling and relatively lower interest rates, the opposite effects can occur.\nChanges in market interest rates could reduce the value of the Bank\u2019s financial assets. Fixed-rate investments, mortgage-backed and related securities and mortgage loans generally decrease in value as interest rates rise. In addition, interest rates affect how much money the Bank lends. For example, when interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases and the loan originations tend to decrease.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits. If the Bank is unsuccessful in managing the effects of changes in interest rates, the financial condition and results of operations could suffer. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHurricanes or other adverse weather events could disrupt our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nNorth Carolina\u2019s coastal region and inland areas of eastern North Carolina are affected, from time to time, by adverse weather events, particularly hurricanes. We cannot predict whether, or to what extent, damage caused by future hurricanes or other weather events will affect our operations. Weather events could cause a disruption in our day-to-day business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n- 24 -\nWe are subject to extensive regulation that could restrict our activities, have an adverse impact on our operations, and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various regulatory agencies. The Company is subject to Federal Reserve Board regulation, and the Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by the FDIC and the Commissioner. In addition, as a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, the Bank must comply with applicable regulations of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the FHLB. The Bank\u2019s activities are also regulated under consumer protection laws applicable to our lending, deposit, and other activities. A claim against us under these laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRegulation by these agencies is intended primarily for the protection of our depositors and the deposit insurance fund and not for the benefit of our shareholders. Federal and state regulators have the ability to impose substantial sanctions, restrictions, and requirements on us if they identify violations of laws with which we must comply or weaknesses or failures with respect to general standards of safety and soundness. Such enforcement may be formal or informal and can include directors\u2019 resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written supervisory agreements, cease-and-desist orders, civil money penalties and termination of deposit insurance and bank closures. Enforcement actions may be taken regardless of the capital levels of the institutions, and regardless of prior examination findings. Any of these consequences could damage our reputation, restrict our ability to expand our business or could require us to raise additional capital or sell assets on terms that are not advantageous to us or our shareholders and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, such violations may occur despite our best efforts.\nChanges in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations.\nCongress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes and is one example of how legislative changes can greatly impact our business. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including, among other things, subjecting us to increased capital requirements, liquidity and risk management requirements, creating additional costs, limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products. While we cannot predict the extent to which additional legislation will be enacted or the extent we will become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny by any of these regulatory agencies, any regulatory changes or scrutiny could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand our permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, and other institutions.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the \u201cPatriot Act\u201d) and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs, conduct enhanced customer due diligence, and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. Federal and state bank regulators also focus on compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\n- 25 -\nFederal, state and local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans and could increase our cost of doing business.\nFederal, state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered \u201cpredatory.\u201d These laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products, selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers, repeatedly refinancing loans and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property. Loans with certain terms and conditions and that otherwise meet the definition of a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d may be protected from liability to a borrower for failing to make the necessary determinations. It is our policy not to make predatory loans and to determine borrowers\u2019 ability to repay in accordance with regulatory standards, but the law and related rules create the potential for increased liability with respect to our lending and loan investment activities. They increase our cost of doing business and, ultimately, may prevent us from making certain loans and impact the cost and pricing of loans that we make.\nWe are subject to federal and state fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nFederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to our performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our rating under the Community Reinvestment Act and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Federal Reserve Board may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nThe Federal Reserve Board requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine, the Federal Reserve Board may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the federal bank regulators to require that all companies that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution serve as a source of strength for the institution. Under these requirements, in the future, we could be required to provide financial assistance to our Bank if the Bank experiences financial distress.\nA capital injection may be required at times when we do not have the resources to provide it, and therefore we may be required to borrow the funds. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding company\u2019s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n- 26 -\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our securities.\nIf we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements, we could be required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. We may also face regulatory enforcement or other actions, including the potential delisting of our securities from NASDAQ. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and could subject us to litigation.\nChanges in accounting standards and management\u2019s selection of accounting methods, including assumptions and estimates, could materially impact our financial statements.\nWe are subject to the accounting rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d). From time to time, the SEC and the FASB update accounting principles generally accepted in the United States that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These updates may require extraordinary efforts or additional costs to implement. Any of these rules or regulations may be modified or changed from time to time, and there can be no assurance that such modifications or changes will not adversely affect us. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results, or a cumulative charge to retained earnings. In addition, management is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. If the assumptions or estimates are incorrect, we may experience unexpected material adverse consequences that could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe FASB has issued an accounting standard update that will result in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses and may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which replaces the current \u201cincurred loss\u201d model for recognizing credit losses with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model. Under the CECL model, we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected over the contractual life of the financial instrument. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \u201cincurred loss\u201d model required under current GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, we expect that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine our allowance for loan losses and could require us to significantly increase our allowance. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n- 27 -\nThe new CECL standard will become effective for us on January 1, 2023 based on our qualifying metrics on December 31, 2019. The new effective date remains in place even if our qualifying metrics change to those applicable for institutions required to adopt CECL as of December 31, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact the CECL model will have on our accounting, but we expect to recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to our allowance for loan losses as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective, consistent with regulatory expectations set forth in interagency guidance issued at the end of 2016. Since the magnitude of the anticipated change in the allowance for loan losses will be impacted by economic conditions and trends in the loan portfolio at the time of adoption, we cannot yet reasonably determine the magnitude of any such one-time cumulative adjustment or of the overall impact of the new standard on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be required to raise additional capital in the future, including to comply with minimum capital thresholds established by our regulators, but that capital may not be available when it is needed and could be dilutive to our existing shareholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nBank holding companies and federally insured banks are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital. Compliance by the Registrant and the Bank with these capital requirements affects our business by increasing the amount of capital required to conduct operations. In order to support the operations at the Bank, we may need to raise capital in the future. Our ability to raise capital will depend in part on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control. Accordingly, we may be unable to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we cannot raise capital when needed, our ability to operate or further expand our operations could be materially impaired. In addition, if we decide to raise equity capital under such conditions, the interests of our shareholders could be diluted.\nWe may need additional access to capital, which we may be unable to obtain on attractive terms or at all.\nWe may need to incur additional debt or equity financing in the future to make strategic acquisitions or investments, for future growth, to fund losses or additional provisions for loan losses in the future, or to strengthen our capital ratios. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend in part on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we may be unable to raise additional capital, if and when needed, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and our stock price could be negatively affected. In addition, if we decide to raise additional equity capital, our current shareholders\u2019 interests could be diluted.\nWe are subject to liquidity risk that may affect our ability to meet our obligations and fund our operations.\nThe primary sources of our Bank\u2019s funds are client deposits and loan repayments. While scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, they are subject to the ability of borrowers to repay the loans. The ability of borrowers to repay loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups, reductions in real estate values or markets, business closings or lay-offs, inclement weather, natural disasters, and international instability. Additionally, deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, regulatory capital requirements, returns available to clients on alternative investments and general economic conditions.\nAccordingly, we may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such sources include FHLB advances, sales of securities and loans, and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks, as well as out-of-market time deposits. While we believe that these sources are currently adequate, there can be no assurance they will be sufficient to meet future liquidity demands, particularly if we continue to grow and experience increasing loan demand. We may be required to slow or discontinue loan growth, capital expenditures or other investments or liquidate assets should such sources not be adequate, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition.\n- 28 -\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may adversely affect our net income and profitability.\nThe last economic recession caused a high level of bank failures, which dramatically increased FDIC resolution costs and led to a significant reduction in the balance of the DIF. As a result, the FDIC significantly increased the initial base assessment rates paid by financial institutions for deposit insurance. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that the Bank is required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are bank or financial institution failures that exceed the FDIC\u2019s expectations, the Bank may be required to pay higher FDIC premiums than those currently in force. Any future increases or required prepayments of FDIC insurance premiums may adversely impact our earnings and financial condition.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird-party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access, core application processing, and operational software. While we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct our business. Any such failures could damage our reputation, which could negatively affect our operating results. Replacing these third-party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nSecurity breaches and other information system disruptions, such as cyber-attacks, could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nThe banking industry has experienced increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber-attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. There have been several recent instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data. In addition, because the techniques used to cause such security breaches change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. The ability of our customers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our financial condition, revenues and competitive position.\n- 29 -\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification, and we could be negatively impacted by these laws. For example, our business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share non-public personal information about our customers with non-affiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to customers about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford customers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of any information sharing by us with non-affiliated third parties (with certain exceptions) and (iii) requires we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of customer information we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal banking regulators and states have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Moreover, legislators and regulators in the United States are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. This could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. This includes increased privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level, by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as at the state level, such as with regard to mobile applications.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws (including those regarding security breach notification) affecting customer or employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect our business.\nThe banking industry undergoes frequent technological changes with introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to improving customer services, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in continuous technological improvements than we do. We may not be able to quickly deploy these new products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Additionally, the implementation of changes and maintenance to current systems may cause service interruptions, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the banking industry while avoiding interruptions, errors and delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe generally outsource a portion of the operational and technological modifications and improvements we make to third parties, and they may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control. In addition, these third parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure. We also face risk from the integration of new infrastructure platforms and/or new third-party providers of such platforms into our existing businesses.\nWe may not be able to realize the remaining benefit of our deferred tax assets.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had a net deferred tax asset of $2.8 million and $3.7 million, respectively. A deferred tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of the evidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the total deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the future ability of the Company to realize the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company will continue to monitor its deferred tax assets closely to evaluate whether we will be able to realize the full benefit of our net deferred tax asset or whether there is any need for a valuation allowance. Significant negative trends in credit quality, losses from operations, or other factors could impact the realization of the deferred tax asset in the future. If we are unable to realize the full benefit of the deferred tax assets, it could negatively impact our results of operations.\n- 30 -\nIf our goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe have goodwill recorded on our balance sheet as an asset with a carrying value as of December 31, 2019 of $24.6 million. Under GAAP, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The test for goodwill impairment involves comparing the fair value of a company\u2019s reporting units to their respective carrying values. The Bank is our only reporting unit. The price of our common stock is one of several factors available for estimating the fair value of our reporting units. Although the price of our common stock is currently trading above book value, it has traded below book value in the past and may do so again in the future. Subject to the results of other valuation techniques, if this situation were to return and persist, it could indicate that a portion of our goodwill is impaired. Accordingly, for this reason or other reasons that indicate that the goodwill at any of our reporting units is impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to effectively compete with larger financial institutions for business.\nCommercial banking in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia is extremely competitive. The Bank competes with some of the largest banking organizations in the state and the country and other financial institutions, such as federally and state-chartered savings and loan institutions and credit unions, as well as consumer finance companies, mortgage companies and other lenders engaged in the business of extending credit. Many of these competitors have broader geographic markets, higher lending limits, more services, and more media advertising than we do. We may not be able to compete effectively in our markets, and our results of operations could be adversely affected by the nature or pace of change in competition.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that historically would have been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as peer-to-peer payments, paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits resulting in reduced liquidity and loss of income generated from those deposits. Additionally, our customer base of consumers and small businesses has increasing non-bank options for credit. Now that credit is available through the Internet, competition for small balance loans is expected to increase. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled people and the lack of sufficient talent could adversely impact our operations.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to retain key executives and to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel who have experience both in sophisticated banking matters and in operating a small- to mid-size bank. Competition for such personnel is strong in the banking industry and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel we require. Consequently the loss of one or more members of our executive management team may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\n- 31 -\nOur business reputation is important and any damage to it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur reputation is very important to sustain our business, as we rely on our relationships with our current, former and potential customers and shareholders, and the industries that we serve. Any damage to our reputation, whether arising from legal, regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions, matters affecting our financial reporting or compliance with SEC and exchange listing requirements, negative publicity, the conduct of our business or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock\nThe relatively low trading volume in our common stock may adversely affect your ability to resell shares at prices that you find attractive or at all.\nOur common stock is listed for quotation on the Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbol \u201cSLCT\u201d. The average daily trading volume for our common stock is less than that of larger financial institutions. Due to its relatively low trading volume, sales of our common stock may place significant downward pressure on the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, it may be difficult for holders to resell their shares at prices they find attractive, or at all.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and subject to fluctuations in response to numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in other risk factors and the following:\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuation in our operating results;\n\u00b7 changes in interest rates;\n\u00b7 changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which we operate;\n\u00b7 press releases, announcements or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in our industry;\n\u00b7 changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7 future sales of our common stock;\n\u00b7 changes in economic conditions in our market, general conditions in the U.S. economy, financial markets or the banking industry; and\n\u00b7 other developments affecting our competitors or us.\nThese factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance, and could prevent a shareholder from selling common stock at or above the current market price. These factors may also adversely affect our ability to raise capital in the open market if needed. In addition, we cannot say with any certainty that a more active and liquid trading market for its common stock will develop.\nAdditional issuances of common stock or securities convertible into common stock may dilute holders of our common stock.\nWe may, in the future, determine that it is advisable, or we may encounter circumstances where it is determined that it is necessary, to issue additional shares of common stock, securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that represent an interest in common stock, or common stock-equivalent securities to fund strategic initiatives or other business needs or to build additional capital. Our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock from time to time for adequate consideration without any additional action on the part of our shareholders in some cases. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of other offerings, as well as other sales of a large block of common stock or the perception that such sales could occur.\n- 32 -\nOur ability to pay cash dividends on our securities is limited and we may be unable to pay future dividends.\nWe have not historically paid cash dividends on our common stock, and we may not declare or pay dividends on our securities, including our common stock, in the future. Any future determination relating to dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors, including our future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, regulatory restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. The holders of our capital stock are entitled to receive dividends when, and if, declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. As part of our consideration of whether to pay cash dividends, we intend to retain adequate funds from future earnings to support the development and growth of our business. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is restricted by federal policies and regulations. It is the current policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on capital stock only out of net income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization\u2019s expected future needs and financial condition. Further, our principal source of funds to pay dividends is cash dividends that we receive from the Bank, which, in turn, will be highly dependent upon the Bank\u2019s historical and projected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and financial condition, as well as various legal and regulatory prohibitions and other restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends, extend credit or otherwise transfer funds to us.\nOur stock repurchase plan may not enhance long-term shareholder value and stock repurchases, if any, could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and will diminish our cash reserves. Stock repurchases may be subject to regulatory approval in some cases.\nIn September 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase plan pursuant to which the Company may purchase up to 937,248 shares of its issued and outstanding common stock. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows, price, corporate and regulatory requirements, available cash, and other market conditions. The plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase plan could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase plan could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a plan and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, repurchases under our stock repurchase plan will diminish our cash reserves, which impacts our ability to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions, support our operations, invest in securities and pay dividends and could result in lower overall returns on our cash balances. Stock repurchases may not enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock, and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness. In some cases, stock repurchases may be subject to regulatory approval. If required, we cannot guarantee that any such approval will be obtained in a timely manner, or at all.\nOur stock price might fluctuate significantly, which could cause the value of your investment in our common stock to decline, and you might not be able to resell your shares at a price at or above the public offering price.\nFrom January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019, the price of our common stock, as reported by NASDAQ Global Market, has ranged from a low closing sale price of $9.71 on January 10, 2017, to a high closing sale price of $14.05 on July 9, 2018. In addition, securities markets worldwide have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our results of operations. Factors that impact the market for our stock include:\n- 33 -\n\u00b7 our operating performance and the operating performance of similar companies;\n\u00b7 the overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u00b7 prevailing interest rates;\n\u00b7 economic, financial, geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events affecting us or the financial markets generally;\n\u00b7 the market for similar securities;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, business plans, or commercial relationships;\n\u00b7 threatened or actual litigation;\n\u00b7 changes in the composition of our board of directors or management;\n\u00b7 publication of research reports or news stories about us, our competitors, or our industry, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 whether we declare dividends on our common stock from time to time;\n\u00b7 our creditworthiness;\n\u00b7 the ratings given to our securities by credit rating agencies, if any;\n\u00b7 large volumes of sales of our shares of common stock by existing shareholders; and\n\u00b7 general political and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for banks and financial services companies in particular, has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. During the financial crisis of 2008-2009, financial institution stocks saw significant loss of value, with some stocks losing all their value due to the failure or bankruptcy of the issuer. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, and ownership of our common stock may have regulatory implications for holders thereof.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state banking laws, including the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the \u201cBHCA\u201d), and federal and state banking regulations, that will impact the rights and obligations of owners of our common stock, including, for example, our ability to declare and pay dividends on our common stock. Shares of our common stock are voting securities for purposes of the BHCA and any bank holding company or foreign bank that is subject to the BHCA may need approval to acquire or retain more than 5% of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock, and any holder (or group of holders deemed to be acting in concert) may need regulatory approval to acquire or retain 10% or more of the shares of our common stock. A holder or group of holders may also be deemed to control us if they own 25% or more of our total equity. Under certain limited circumstances, a holder or group of holders acting in concert may exceed the 25% percent threshold and not be deemed to control us until they own 33% percent or more of our total equity. The amount of total equity owned by a holder or group of holders acting in concert is calculated by aggregating all shares held by the holder or group, whether as a combination of voting or non-voting shares or through other positions treated as equity for regulatory or accounting purposes and meeting certain other conditions. Holders of our common stock should consult their own counsel with regard to regulatory implications of acquiring shares of our common stock.\nHolders should not expect us to redeem outstanding shares of our common stock.\nOur common stock is a perpetual equity security. This means that it has no maturity or mandatory redemption date and will not be redeemable at the option of the holders. Any decision we may make at any time to propose the repurchase or redemption of shares of our common stock will depend upon, among other things, our evaluation of our capital position, the composition of our shareholders\u2019 equity, general market conditions at that time and other factors we deem relevant. Our ability to redeem shares of our common stock is subject to regulatory restrictions and limitations, including those of the Federal Reserve.\n- 34 -\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize us to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of one or more series of preferred stock. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, has the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series, the designation of such series, and the dividend rate for each series, without any further vote or action by our shareholders. Our preferred stock may be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price, and materially adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.\nOfferings of debt, which would rank senior to our common stock upon liquidation, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may attempt to increase our capital resources or, if regulatory capital ratios fall below the required minimums, we could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt or equity securities, senior or subordinated notes, preferred stock and common stock. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of available assets prior to the holders of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions could adversely affect our shareholders.\nIn some cases, shareholders would receive a premium for their shares if we were acquired by another company. However, state and federal law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws make it difficult for anyone to acquire us without approval of our board of directors. For example, our articles of incorporation require a supermajority vote of two-thirds of our outstanding common stock in order to effect a sale or merger of the Company in certain circumstances. Consequently, a takeover attempt may prove difficult, and shareholders may not realize the highest possible price for their securities.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit and may lose value.\nShares of our common stock are not savings accounts, deposits or other obligations of any depository institution and are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other governmental agency or instrumentality, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. An investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. As a result, if you acquire shares of our common stock, you may lose some or all of your investment.", "PERMNO": 91360, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SLCT"}
