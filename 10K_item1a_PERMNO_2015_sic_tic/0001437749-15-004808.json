RISK FACTORS\nRisks associated with our business\nWe have a history of operating losses and may incur losses in the future.\nWe have experienced net losses from continuing operations of approximately $5.8 million, $6.9 million, $6.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $7.5 million and an accumulated deficit of $88.8 million. In order for us to attain profitability and growth, we will need to continue to address legacy issues that have historically burdened our financial performance, including improvement in gross margins, execution of our marketing and sales plans for our energy-efficient LED lighting products, the development of new technologies into sustainable product lines, and continued improvements in our supply chain performance.\nThere is a risk that our business may not be as successful as we envision as we work to generate sufficient cash flow to meet obligations and sustain operations without obtaining additional external financing. We currently have a revolving credit facility that provides funding for our operations. We have the right to terminate the facility on December 31, 2015, and the lender may terminate the facility at any time by providing the requisite advance notice. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flows to sustain our operations or obtain funding on acceptable terms or in a timely fashion or at all. As such, we will continue to review and pursue selected external funding sources, if necessary, to execute these objectives including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf\nrenew our existing credit facility on acceptable terms prior to its expiration or termination or obtain funding from other financial institutions on acceptable terms,\n\u25cf\nobtain financing from traditional or non-traditional investment capital organizations or individuals, and\n\u25cf\nobtain funding from the sale of our common stock or other equity or debt instruments or the exercise of outstanding warrants.\nObtaining financing through the above-mentioned mechanisms contains risks, including:\n\u25cf\nloans or other debt instruments may have terms and/or conditions, such as interest rate, restrictive covenants and control or revocation provisions, which are not acceptable to management or our Board of Directors,\n\u25cf\nthe current environment in capital markets combined with our capital constraints may prevent us from being able to obtain adequate debt financing,\n\u25cf\nfinancing may not be available for parties interested in pursuing the acquisition of one or more of our operating units, and\n\u25cf\nadditional equity financing may not be available to us in the current capital environment and could lead to further dilution of stockholder value for current stockholders of record.\nIf we fail to generate sufficient cash, including from sales revenues, loans or other external funding sources, we may be required to change our planned business strategies. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing, we may not be able to successfully develop and market our products and services. As a result, we would need to curtail business operations, which would have a material negative effect on operating results, the value of our outstanding stock is likely to fall, and our business may fail, causing our stockholders to lose their entire investments.\nDepressed general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the United States. An economic downturn may adversely impact our business. Slow growth in the economy or an economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to meet our working capital requirements and growth objectives, or could otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As a result, any general or market-specific economic downturns, particularly those affecting construction and building renovation, or that cause end-users to reduce or delay their purchases of lighting products, services, or retrofit activities, would have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few customers and the loss of one of these customers, or a reduction in their demand for our services, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur customer base is highly concentrated. One or a few customers have represented a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues and gross profits in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. In 2014, sales to our ten largest customers from continuing operations accounted for approximately 77.2 percent of net sales. Customers accounting for greater than 10 percent of our net sales from continuing operations included Energy Management Products, LLC, a distributor for the U.S. Navy, which accounted for approximately 50.4 percent. There were no other customers accounting for greater than 10 percent of our net sales. A limited number of customers may continue to comprise a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. We could lose business from a significant customer for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u25cf\nlevels of funding available to governmental customers, a change in procurement strategies employed by those customers and our ability to fulfill our obligations to such customers and comply with government contracting laws and regulations,\n\u25cf\nthe consolidation, merger or acquisition of an existing customer, resulting in a change in procurement strategies employed by the surviving entity that could reduce the amount of orders we receive,\n\u25cf\nour performance on individual relationships with one or more significant customers are impaired due to another reason, which may cause us to lose future business with such customers and, as a result, our ability to generate income would be adversely impacted, and\n\u25cf\nthe strength of our professional reputation.\nA significant portion of our business is dependent upon the existence of government funding, which may not be available into the future and could result in a significant reduction in sales and could cause significant harm to our business.\nWe anticipate a significant portion of our future product sales will come from the military and maritime markets, which is reliant upon federal funding. In particular, sales of our products for the U.S. Navy have accounted for a substantial portion of our net sales in recent periods and we have recently announced additional significant orders for the U.S. Navy. In addition, in the past a significant portion of our research and development efforts have been supported directly by government funding and were contracted for short periods, usually one to two years. Further, a significant portion of net sales generated by EFLS are derived from state government funding and supported by federal government funding. U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by the U.S. Congress of the necessary spending to honor such contracts. We cannot be certain that our U.S. government contracts will not be terminated or suspended in the future due to reductions or eliminations of government funding. If government funding is reduced or eliminated, there is no guarantee that we would be able to continue to fund our activities in these areas at their current levels, if at all, and grow our product sales. If we are unable to maintain our access to government funding in these areas, there could be a significant impact on our net sales and profits and our ability to compete and develop new products.\nOur operating results may fluctuate due to factors that are difficult to forecast and not within our control.\nOur past operating results may not be accurate indicators of future performance, and you should not rely on such results to predict our future performance. Our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past, and could fluctuate in the future. Factors that may contribute to fluctuations include:\n\u25cf\nchanges in aggregate capital spending, cyclicality and other economic conditions, or domestic and international demand in the industries,\n\u25cf\nthe timing of large customer orders, particularly for the U.S. Navy,\n\u25cf\nour ability to effectively manage our working capital,\n\u25cf\nour ability to satisfy consumer demands in a timely and cost-effective manner,\n\u25cf\npricing and availability of labor and materials,\n\u25cf\nour inability to adjust certain fixed costs and expenses for changes in demand,\n\u25cf\nseasonal fluctuations in demand and our revenue, and\n\u25cf\ndisruption in component supply from foreign vendors.\nIf LED lighting technology fails to gain widespread market acceptance or we are unable to respond effectively as new lighting technologies and market trends emerge, our competitive position and our ability to generate revenue and profits may be harmed.\nTo be successful, we depend on continued market acceptance of our existing LED technology. Although adoption of LED lighting continues to grow, the use of LED lighting products for general illumination is in its early stages, is still limited, and faces significant challenges. Potential customers may be reluctant to adopt LED lighting products as an alternative to traditional lighting technology because of its higher initial cost or perceived risks relating to its novelty, reliability, usefulness, light quality, and cost-effectiveness when compared to other established lighting sources available in the market. Changes in economic and market conditions may also affect the marketability of some traditional lighting technologies such as declining energy prices in certain regions or countries may favor existing lighting technologies that are less energy efficient, reducing the rate of adoption for LED lighting products in those areas. Even if LED lighting products continue to achieve performance improvements and cost reductions, limited customer awareness of the benefits of LED lighting products, lack of widely accepted standards governing LED lighting products and customer unwillingness to adopt LED lighting products in favor of entrenched solutions could significantly limit the demand for LED lighting products and adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, we will need to keep pace with rapid changes in LED technology, changing customer requirements, new product introductions by competitors and evolving industry standards, any of which could render our existing products obsolete if we fail to respond in a timely manner. Development of new products incorporating advanced technology is a complex process subject to numerous uncertainties. We have previously experienced, and could in the future experience, delays in the introduction of new products. If effective new sources of light other than LEDs are discovered, our current products and technologies could become less competitive or obsolete. If others develop innovative proprietary lighting technology that is superior to ours, or if we fail to accurately anticipate technology and market trends, respond on a timely basis with our own development of new products and enhancements to existing products, and achieve broad market acceptance of these products and enhancements, our competitive position may be harmed and we may not achieve sufficient growth in our net sales to attain or sustain profitability.\nIf we are unable to manage future growth effectively, our profitability and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to achieve our desired growth depends on our execution in functional areas such as product development and management, sales and marketing, and general administration and operations. To manage any future growth, we must continue to improve our product development, distribution, operational, and financial processes and systems and expand, train and manage our employee base and control associated costs. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our expenses could increase without a proportionate increase in revenue, our margins could decrease, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively against companies with greater resources, our prospects for future success will be jeopardized.\nThe lighting industry is highly competitive. In the high performance lighting markets in which we sell our advanced lighting systems, our products compete with lighting products utilizing traditional lighting technology provided by many vendors. Additionally, in the advanced lighting markets in which we have primarily competed to date, competition has largely been fragmented among a number of small manufacturers. However, some of our competitors, particularly those that offer traditional lighting products, are larger, established companies with greater resources to devote to research and development, manufacturing and marketing, as well as greater brand recognition.\nMoreover, we encounter competition from an even greater number of companies in the general lighting market. Our competitors also include the large, established companies in the general lighting industry, such as General Electric Company, Osram Sylvania, CREE, Inc., and Royal Philips Electronics. Each of these competitors offers lighting products utilizing LED technology. These companies have global marketing capabilities and substantially greater resources to devote to research and development and other aspects of the development, manufacture, and marketing of LED lighting products than we possess. The relatively low barriers to entry into the lighting industry and the limited proprietary nature of many lighting products also permit new competitors to enter the industry easily.\nIn each of our markets, we also anticipate the possibility that LED manufacturers, including those that currently supply us with LEDs, may seek to compete with us. Our competitors\u2019 lighting technologies and products may be more readily accepted by customers than our products will be. Moreover, if one or more of our competitors or suppliers were to merge with one another, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our competitive position. Additionally, to the extent that competition in our markets intensifies, we may be required to reduce our prices in order to remain competitive. If we do not compete effectively, or if we reduce our prices without making commensurate reductions in our costs, our net sales and profitability and our future prospects for success may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to obtain and adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to commercialize our products could be substantially limited.\nWe consider our technology and processes proprietary. If we are not able to adequately protect or enforce the proprietary aspects of our technology, competitors may utilize our proprietary technology. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. We protect our technology through a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and similar means. Despite our efforts, other parties may attempt to disclose, obtain, or use our technologies. Our competitors may also be able to independently develop products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products or slightly modify our patents. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States. As a result, we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights adequately in the United States or abroad. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be issued patents for which we have applied or obtain additional patents, or that we will be able to obtain licenses to patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties that we may need to support our business in the future. The inability to obtain certain patents or rights to third-party patents and other intellectual property rights in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions, which may result in protracted and expensive litigation. We have engaged in litigation in the past and litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation may also be necessary to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity by others. An adverse outcome in litigation or any similar proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to license disputed rights from others or require us to cease marketing or using certain products or technologies. We may not be able to obtain any licenses on acceptable terms, if at all, and may attempt to redesign those products that contain allegedly infringing intellectual property, which may not be possible. We also may have to indemnify certain customers if it is determined that we have infringed upon or misappropriated another party\u2019s intellectual property. The cost of addressing any intellectual property litigation claim, both in legal fees and expenses, and the diversion of management resources, regardless of whether the claim is valid, could be significant and could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf critical components and finished products that we currently purchase from a small number of third-party suppliers become unavailable or increase in price, or if our suppliers fail to meet our requirements for quality, quantity and timeliness, our revenue and reputation in the marketplace could be harmed, which would damage our business.\nIn an effort to reduce manufacturing costs, we have outsourced the production of certain parts and components, as well as finished goods in our product lines, to a small number of vendors in various locations throughout the world, primarily in the United States, China, and Taiwan. While we believe alternative sources for these components and products are available, we have selected these particular suppliers based on their ability to consistently provide the best quality product at the most cost effective price, to meet our specifications, and to deliver within scheduled time frames. If our suppliers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, we may suffer lost sales, reductions in revenue and damage to our reputation in the market, all of which would adversely affect our business. We may be vulnerable to unanticipated price increases and payment term changes. Significant increases in the prices of sourced components and products could cause our product prices to increase, which may reduce demand for our products or make us more susceptible to competition. Furthermore, in the event that we are unable to pass along increases in operating costs to our customers, margins and profitability may be adversely affected. Accordingly, the loss of all or one of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our operations until such time as an alternative supplier could be found.\nAdditionally, consolidation in the lighting industry could result in one or more current suppliers being acquired by a competitor, rendering us unable to continue purchasing key components and products at competitive prices. We may be subject to various import duties applicable to materials manufactured in foreign countries and may be affected by various other import and export restrictions, as well as other considerations or developments impacting upon international trade, including economic or political instability, shipping delays and product quotas. These international trade factors will, under certain circumstances, have an impact on the cost of components, which will have an impact on the cost to us of the manufactured product and the wholesale and retail prices of our products.\nWe depend on independent distributors and sales representatives for a substantial portion of our net sales, and the failure to manage our relationships with these third parties, or the termination of these relationships, could cause our net sales to decline and harm our business.\nAlthough we are building our sales force to sell directly to end clients, we currently rely significantly on indirect sales channels to market and sell our products. Most of our products are sold through third-party independent distributors and sales representatives. In particular, sales of our products for the U.S. Navy, which have accounted for a substantial portion of our net sales in recent periods, are made through an independent distributor. In addition, these parties provide technical sales support to end-users. Our current agreements within these sales channels are generally non-exclusive, meaning they can sell products of our competitors. We anticipate that any such agreements we enter into in the future will be on similar terms. Furthermore, our agreements are generally short-term, and can be cancelled by these sales channels without significant financial consequence. We cannot control how these distributors or sales representatives perform and cannot be certain that we or end-users will be satisfied by their performance. If these distributors and sales representatives significantly change their terms with us, or change their historical pattern of ordering products from us, there could be a significant impact on our net sales and profits.\nOur products could contain defects or they may be installed or operated incorrectly, which could reduce sales of those products or result in claims against us.\nDespite product testing, defects may be found in our existing or future products. This could result in, among other things, a delay in the recognition or loss of net sales, loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance. These defects could cause us to incur significant warranty, support, and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts, and harm our relationships with our customers. The occurrence of these problems could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our lighting products and would likely harm our business. Some of our products use line voltages (such as 120 or 240 AC), which involve enhanced risk of electrical shock, injury or death in the event of a short circuit or other malfunction. Defects, integration issues or other performance problems in our lighting products could result in personal injury or financial or other damages to end-users or could damage market acceptance of our products. Our customers and end-users could also seek damages from us for their losses. A product liability claim brought against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time consuming and costly to defend.\nOur business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations.\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from direct and indirect sales to U.S., state, local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies. In particular, sales of our products for the U.S. Navy have accounted for a substantial portion of our net sales in recent periods and we have recently announced additional significant orders for the U.S. Navy. Contracts with government customers are subject to various procurement laws and regulations, business prerequisites to qualify for such contracts, accounting procedures, intellectual property process, and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance, which may provide for various rights and remedies in favor of the governments that are not typically applicable to or found in commercial contracts. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, or provisions in our government contracts could result in litigation, the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, or suspension from future government contracting. If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer due to, among other factors, lost sales, the costs of any government action or penalties, damages to our reputation and the inability to recover our investment in developing and marketing products for government use.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have significant U.S. net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards (the \u201cTax Attributes\u201d). Under federal tax laws, we can carry forward and use our Tax Attributes to reduce our future U.S. taxable income and tax liabilities until such Tax Attributes expire in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cIRC\u201d). Section 382 and Section 383 of the IRC provide an annual limitation on our ability to utilize our Tax Attributes, as well as certain built-in-losses, against future U.S. taxable income in the event of a change in ownership, as defined under the IRC. Share issuances in connection with our past financing transactions, this offering or other future changes in our stock ownership, which may be beyond our control, could result in changes in ownership for purposes of the IRC. Such changes in ownership could further limit our ability to use our Tax Attributes. Accordingly, any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe cost of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to a broad range of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose increasingly stringent environmental, health, and safety protection standards and permit requirements regarding, among other things, air emissions, wastewater storage, treatment, and discharges, the use and handling of hazardous or toxic materials, waste disposal practices, the remediation of environmental contamination, and working conditions for our employees. Some environmental laws, such as Superfund, the Clean Water Act, and comparable laws in U.S. states and other jurisdictions world-wide, impose joint and several liability for the cost of environmental remediation, natural resource damages, third party claims, and other expenses, without regard to the fault or the legality of the original conduct, on those persons who contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. We may also be affected by future laws or regulations, including those imposed in response to energy, climate change, geopolitical, or similar concerns. These laws may impact the sourcing of raw materials and the manufacture and distribution of our products and place restrictions and other requirements on the products that we can sell in certain geographical locations.\nWe have international sales and are subject to risks associated with operating in international markets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net sales of our products outside of the United States represented 9 percent of our total net sales from continuing operations. We generally provide technical expertise and limited marketing support, while our independent international distributors generally provide sales staff, local marketing, and product services. We believe our international distributors are better able to service international markets due to their understanding of local market conditions and best business practices. International business operations are subject to inherent risks, including, among others:\n\u25cf\ndifficulty in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems,\n\u25cf\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs, and other trade barriers or restrictions,\n\u25cf\npotentially adverse tax consequences,\n\u25cf\nthe burdens of compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, similar anti-bribery laws in other countries, and a wide variety of laws,\n\u25cf\nimport and export license requirements and restrictions of the United States and each other country in which we operate,\n\u25cf\nexposure to different legal standards and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries,\n\u25cf\ncurrency fluctuations and restrictions, and\n\u25cf\npolitical, social, and economic instability, including war and the threat of war, acts of terrorism, pandemics, boycotts, curtailment of trade, or other business restrictions.\nIf we do not anticipate and effectively manage these risks, these factors may have a material adverse impact on our sales, thus lowering our total revenues.\nIf we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel, our business and product development efforts could be harmed.\nTo a large extent, our future success will depend on the continued contributions of certain employees, such as our current Chief Executive Officer, Interim Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Operating Officer. We had significant turnover in our management team since 2013 and cannot be certain that these and other key employees will continue in their respective capacities for any period of time, and these employees may be difficult to replace. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales, marketing, and management personnel, for whom competition is very intense. The loss of, or failure to attract, hire, and retain any such persons could delay product development cycles, disrupt our operations, or otherwise harm our business or results of operations.\nWe believe that certification and compliance issues are critical to adoption of our lighting systems, and failure to obtain such certification or compliance would harm our business.\nWe are required to comply with certain legal requirements governing the materials in our products. Although we are not aware of any efforts to amend any existing legal requirements or implement new legal requirements in a manner with which we cannot comply, our net sales might be adversely affected if such an amendment or implementation were to occur.\nMoreover, although not legally required to do so, we strive to obtain certification for substantially all our products. In the United States, we seek certification on substantially all of our products from Underwriters Laboratories (UL\u00ae) or Intertek Testing Services (ETL\u00ae). Where appropriate in jurisdictions outside the United States and Europe, we seek to obtain other similar national or regional certifications for our products. Although we believe that our broad knowledge and experience with electrical codes and safety standards have facilitated certification approvals, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain any such certifications for our new products or that, if certification standards are amended, that we will be able to maintain such certifications for our existing products. Moreover, although we are not aware of any effort to amend any existing certification standard or implement a new certification standard in a manner that would render us unable to maintain certification for our existing products or obtain ratification for new products, our net sales might be adversely affected if such an amendment or implementation were to occur.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nAs a public company reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including section 404(a) that requires that we annually evaluate and report on our systems of internal controls.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission as of December 31, 2014. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that there was a material weaknesses identified in our internal controls as of December 31, 2014. The material weaknesses related to a lack of effective controls over revenue recognition. We are actively engaged in developing and implementing a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results.\nFailure to effectively estimate employer-sponsored health insurance premiums and incremental costs due to the Affordable Healthcare Act could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nIn March 2010, the United States federal government enacted comprehensive health care reform legislation, which, among other things, includes guaranteed coverage requirements, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits, restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded, and imposes new taxes on health insurers, self-insured companies, and health care benefits. The legislation imposes implementation effective dates that began in 2010 and extend through 2020, with many of the changes requiring additional guidance from federal agencies and regulations. Possible adverse effects could include increased costs, exposure to expanded liability, and requirements for us to revise the ways in which healthcare and other benefits are provided to employees.\nWe may be subject to legal claims against us or claims by us which could have a significant impact on our resulting financial performance.\nAt any given time, we may be subject to litigation related to our products, suppliers, customers, employees, stockholders, distributors, sales representatives, and sales of our assets, among other things, the disposition of which may have an adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, or results of operation. The outcome of litigation is difficult to assess or quantify. Lawsuits can result in the payment of substantial damages by defendants. If we are required to pay substantial damages and expenses as a result of these or other types of lawsuits our business and results of operations would be adversely affected. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations. Insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover any liabilities with respect to these or other matters. A judgment or other liability in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could adversely affect our business and the results of our operations.\nWe rely heavily on information technology in our operations and any material failure, weakness, interruption or breach of security could prevent us from effectively operating our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on our information technology systems, including our enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) software, across our operations and corporate functions, including for management of our supply chain, payment of obligations, data warehousing to support analytics, finance systems, accounting systems, and other various processes and procedures, some of which are handled by third parties.\nOur ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience system usage problems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, maintenance problems, system conversions, back-up failures, problems or lack of resources for upgrading or transitioning to new platforms or damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including, without limitation, fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems failure, security breaches, cyber-attacks, viruses or human error could result in, among other things, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of data, inability to generate timely SEC reports, loss of sales and customers and reduce efficiency in our operations. Additionally, we and our customers could suffer financial and reputational harm if customer or Company proprietary information is compromised by such events. Remediation of such problems could result in significant unplanned capital investments and any damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks associated with an investment in our common stock\nWe could issue additional common stock or may need to request our stockholders to authorize additional shares of common stock, which might dilute the book value and market for our common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue 15,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 9,423,975 shares were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2014. As of such date, an additional 2,426,224 shares were reserved for issuance as future awards or upon exercise or settlement outstanding awards pursuant to our equity incentive plans, for purchase under our employee stock purchase plan or for issuance upon exercise of certain outstanding warrants. If or when these securities are purchased or exercised for or converted into shares of our common stock, the number of our shares of common stock outstanding will increase. Increases in our outstanding shares, and any sales of shares, could have an adverse effect on the trading activity and market price of our common stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue a sizeable part of our authorized but unissued shares. Such stock issuances could be made at a price that reflects a discount or a premium from the then-current trading price of our common stock. In addition, in order to raise capital or acquire businesses in the future, we may need to issue additional securities or promissory notes that are convertible or exchangeable for shares of our common stock. These issuances would dilute stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership interest, which would have the effect of reducing influence on matters on which our stockholders vote, and might dilute the book value of our common stock. Stockholders may incur additional and substantial dilution if holders of stock options, whether currently outstanding or subsequently granted, exercise those options, or holders of warrants exercise to purchase shares of our common stock. If an insufficient amount of authorized, but unissued shares of common stock exists to issue in the future in connection with subsequent equity financing or acquisition transactions, we may be required to ask our stockholders to authorize additional shares before undertaking, or as a condition to completing, a financing or acquisition transaction. We cannot be assured that our stockholders would authorize an increase in the number of shares of our common stock.\nThe elimination of monetary liability against our directors under Delaware law and the existence of indemnification rights held by our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by the Company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers, and employees.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation eliminates the personal liability of our directors to our Company and our stockholders for damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer to the extent permissible under Delaware law. Further, our Bylaws provide that we are obligated to indemnify any of our directors or officers to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law and, subject to certain conditions, advance the expenses incurred by any director or officer or director in defending any action, suit or proceeding prior to its final disposition. Those indemnification obligations could result in the Company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against our directors or officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against any of our current or former directors or officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit us or our stockholders.\nAs a \u201cthinly-traded\u201d stock, large sales can and have placed negative pressure on our common stock price.\nOur common stock has generally been considered to be \u201cthinly-traded,\u201d and may remain so despite our listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market. Additionally, we have entered into in the past or may enter into in the future, financing or acquisition transactions resulting in a large number of newly issued shares that become immediately tradable or tradable simultaneously in the future. These factors coupled with a limited number of market makers impairs the liquidity of our stock, not only the number of shares that can be bought and sold, but also the through possible delays in the timing of transactions, and lower prices for our common stock than might otherwise prevail. This could make it difficult or impossible for an investor to sell shares of our common stock within a desired timeframe or to obtain a desired price.\nIn addition, from time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all, or a portion of, their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, or under effective resale prospectuses. Any substantial sale of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or any resale prospectus may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock, nor do we anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the operations and expansion of our business. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon the earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements and other factors as deemed necessary by our Board of Directors.\nThe NASDAQ Capital Market may not continue to list our common stock for trading on its exchange if we do not comply with its continued listing requirements, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock and its liquidity.\nWe must comply with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements related to, among other things, stockholders\u2019 equity, market value, minimum bid price, and corporate governance in order to remain listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Although we expect to meet the continued listing requirements, there can be no assurance we will continue to do so in the future. If we do not remain compliant with these continued listing requirements, we could be delisted. If we were delisted, it would be likely to have a negative impact on our stock price and liquidity. The delisting of our common stock could also deter broker-dealers from making a market in or otherwise generating interest in or recommending our common stock, and would adversely affect our ability to attract investors in our common stock. Furthermore, our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired. As a result of these factors, the value of the common stock could decline significantly.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is likely to be influenced by any research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. In the event securities or industry analysts cover us and one or more of these analysts downgrades our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline. These risks could be especially significant for us since we have a small public float and limited analyst coverage.", "PERMNO": 80812, "SIC": 3640, "TIC": "EFOI"}
