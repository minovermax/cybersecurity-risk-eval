{"cik": "1606440", "company": "Reliant Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before you decide to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all other information included in this Annual Report, including the disclosures in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d We believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us as of the date of this Annual Report. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, you could experience a partial or complete loss of your investment.\nRisks Related to Reliant Bancorp\u2019s Business\nReliant Bancorp is geographically concentrated in Middle Tennessee and changes in local economic conditions impact our profitability.\nWe currently operate primarily in the Nashville MSA, and most of our loan, deposit and other customers live or have operations in this area. Accordingly, our success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits, and housing starts in this market, along with the continued attraction of business ventures to the area, and our profitability is impacted by the changes in general economic conditions in this market. We cannot assure you that economic conditions, including loan demand, in our market will improve during 2020, or thereafter, and in that case, we may not be able to grow our loan portfolio in line with our expectations. In addition, the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us may be negatively impacted and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nCompared to regional or national financial institutions, we are less able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. Moreover, we cannot give any assurance that we will benefit from any market growth or more favorable economic conditions in our primary market areas if they do occur.\nReliant Bank\u2019s decisions regarding credit risk and provision for loan loss may materially and adversely affect its business.\nMaking loans and other extensions of credit is an essential element of Reliant Bank\u2019s business. Although Reliant Bank seeks to mitigate risks inherent in lending by adhering to specific underwriting practices, its loans and other extensions of credit may not be repaid. The risk of nonpayment is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe duration of the credit;\n\u2022\ncredit risks of a particular customer;\n\u2022\nchanges in micro or macroeconomic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nin the case of a collateralized loan, risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral.\nReliant Bank attempts to maintain an appropriate allowance for loan and lease loss (\"ALLL\") to provide for potential losses in its loan portfolio. Reliant Bank periodically determines the amount of the allowance based on consideration of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nan ongoing review of the quality, mix, and size of Reliant Bank\u2019s overall loan portfolio;\n\u2022\nReliant Bank\u2019s historical loan loss experience;\n\u2022\nevaluation of micro and macroeconomic conditions;\n\u2022\nregular reviews of loan delinquencies and loan portfolio quality; and\n\u2022\nthe amount and quality of collateral, including guarantees, securing the loans.\nThere is no precise method of predicting credit losses; therefore, Reliant Bank faces the risk that charge-offs in future periods will exceed its ALLL and that additional increases in the ALLL will be required. Additions to the ALLL would result in a decrease in Reliant Bancorp\u2019s net income and capital.\nFederal and state regulators periodically review Reliant Bank\u2019s ALLL and may require us to increase its provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of its management. Any increase in the amount of Reliant Bank\u2019s provision or loans charged-off as required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on its operating results.\nUncertain market conditions and economic trends could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in an uncertain economic environment, including generally uncertain conditions nationally and locally in our industry and market. Financial institutions continue to be affected by volatility in the real estate market in some parts of the country and uncertain regulatory and interest rate conditions. We retain direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate market in Middle Tennessee, particularly in the Nashville MSA, and are affected by these events.\nOur ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and to estimate the losses inherent in our loan portfolio is made more complex by uncertain market and economic conditions. While economic conditions in the United States are at positive market levels for low unemployment, job participation rates and real estate values, economic growth may slow or reverse as concerns about the level of United States government debt and fiscal actions that may be taken to address this, as well as economic and political conditions in the national and global markets. Unfavorable economic trends, sustained high unemployment, and declines in real estate values can cause a reduction in the availability of commercial credit and can negatively impact the credit performance of commercial and consumer loans, resulting in increased write-downs. These negative trends can cause economic pressure on consumers and businesses and diminish confidence in the financial markets, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to access capital. A worsening of these conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown, would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial services industry.\nOur risk management practices, such as monitoring the concentration of our loans within specific industries and our credit approval practices, may not adequately reduce credit risk, and our credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of the loan portfolio. A national economic recession or deterioration of conditions in our market could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our ALLL and result in one or more of the following consequences:\n\u2022\nincreases in loan delinquencies;\n\u2022\nincreases in nonperforming assets and foreclosures;\n\u2022\ndecreases in demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our liquidity position; and\n\u2022\ndecreases in the value of the collateral securing our loans, especially real estate, which could reduce customers\u2019 borrowing power and repayment ability.\nDeclines in real estate values, volume of home sales and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment, including job losses, could have an adverse effect on our borrowers and/or their customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterest rate shifts could reduce net interest income and otherwise negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nA large portion of our banking assets are monetary in nature and subject to risk from changes in interest rates. Like most financial institutions, our earnings and cash flows depend to a great extent upon the level of net interest income, or the difference between the interest income earned on loans, investments and other interest-earning assets, and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in interest rates can increase or decrease net interest income because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly or to a greater degree than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly or to a greater degree than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income.\nAn increase in interest rates may also, among other things, reduce the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans and decrease loan repayment rates. A decrease in the general level of interest rates may affect us through, among other things, increased prepayments on our loan portfolio and increased competition for deposits. Accordingly, changes in the level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest-earning assets, loan origination volume, loan portfolio and overall results. Although our asset-liability management strategy is designed to control and mitigate exposure to the risks related to changes in market interest rates, those rates are affected by many factors outside of our control, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply, international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets.\nAdditionally, interest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for our borrowers, which increases the potential for default and could result in a decrease in the demand for loans. At the same time, the marketability of the property securing a loan may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, there may be an increase in prepayments on loans as borrowers refinance their loans at lower rates. In addition, in a low interest rate environment, loan customers often pursue long-term fixed rate credits, which could adversely affect our earnings and net interest margin if rates increase. Changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans, securities and other assets. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue and profitability. RMV may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels, job growth, and consumer confidence and availability of mortgage financing, one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels. RMV is also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgage-backed securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market. In the event that disruptions to the secondary markets tighten or eliminate the available liquidity within the secondary markets for mortgage loans, we could experience a material adverse effect with respect to sales of mortgage loans and the profitability of our mortgage banking business.\nFurther, when we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. At the same time, we continue to incur a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense on deposits and borrowings, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. We would incur a higher cost of funds to retain these deposits in a rising interest rate environment. Our net interest income could be adversely affected if the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings increase more rapidly than the rates we earn on loans and investment securities. Thus, an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets would have an adverse impact on our net interest income.\nReliant Bank may have higher loan losses than it has allowed for in its ALLL. Our loan portfolio includes a meaningful amount of construction and development, commercial mortgage, and other commercial loans, which have a greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans.\nReliant Bank\u2019s actual loan losses could exceed its ALLL. Reliant Bank\u2019s average loan size continues to increase and reliance on its historic ALLL may not be adequate. A large portion of Reliant Bank\u2019s loan portfolio is composed of construction and development, commercial mortgage, and other commercial loans. Repayment of such loans is generally considered more subject to market risk than residential mortgage loans. Industry experience shows that a portion of loans will become delinquent and a portion of loans will require partial or entire charge-off. Regardless of the underwriting criteria used, losses may be experienced as a result of various factors beyond Reliant Bank\u2019s control, including, among other things, changes in market conditions affecting the value of loan collateral and problems affecting the credit of Reliant Bank\u2019s borrowers.\nOur business may suffer if there are significant declines in the value of real estate.\nThe market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located. If the value of the real estate serving as collateral for our loan portfolio were to decline materially, a significant part of our loan portfolio could become under-collateralized. If the loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled during a time when market conditions are declining or have declined, we may not be able to realize the value of the security anticipated when we originated the loan, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our allowance and provision for loan and lease losses and our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nMost of our foreclosed assets are comprised of real estate properties. We carry these properties at their estimated fair values less estimated selling costs. While we believe the carrying values for such assets are reasonable and appropriately reflect current market conditions, there can be no assurance that the values of such assets will not further decline prior to sale or that the amount of proceeds realized upon disposition of foreclosed assets will approximate the carrying value of such assets. If the proceeds from any such dispositions are less than the carrying value of foreclosed assets, we will record a loss on the disposition of such assets, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCompared to national financial institutions, we are less able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. Moreover, we cannot give any assurance that we will benefit from any market growth or return of more favorable economic conditions in our primary market areas if they do occur.\nReliant Bank\u2019s focus on lending to small to mid-sized community based businesses may increase Reliant Bancorp\u2019s credit risk.\nMost of Reliant Bank\u2019s commercial business and commercial real estate loans are made to small business or middle market customers. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. Small to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which characteristics may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small or medium-sized business often depends on the management skills, talents and efforts of a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loans. If general economic conditions in the markets in which Reliant Bank operates negatively impact this important customer sector, Reliant Bancorp\u2019s results of operations and financial condition and the value of its common stock may be adversely affected. Furthermore, the deterioration of Reliant Bank\u2019s borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with Reliant Bank, which could have a material adverse effect on Reliant Bancorp\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting policies, standards and interpretations.\nThe FASB and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. Additionally, those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Changes resulting from these new standards may result in materially different financial results and may require that we change how we process, analyze and report financial information and that we change financial reporting controls.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued CECL . The FASB subsequently issued an update and CECL is currently scheduled to become effective for Reliant Bank 2023. This standard amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available for sale debt securities. CECL will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans and recognize the expected credit losses through provision for loan losses. This will change the current method of provisioning for loan losses that are probable, which may require Reliant Bank to increase its ALLL, and is likely to increase the types of data Reliant Bank would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of its ALLL. In addition, this change may result in more volatility in the level of Reliant Bank's ALLL. An increase, to the extent material, in Reliant Bank's ALLL or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the ALLL could have a material adverse effect on our capital levels, financial condition, and results of operations.\nASU 2016-02, \u201cLeases (Topic 842).\u201d ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee\u2019s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for us on January 1, 2020 and will require transition using a modified retrospective approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the consolidated financial statements. The effect of implementing this pronouncement resulted in right to use assets of $12,032 and a corresponding lease liability.\nWe may be unable to implement aspects of our growth strategy, which may affect our ability to maintain historical earnings trends.\nOur business has grown rapidly with a strategy focused on organic growth, supplemented by acquisitions. Financial institutions that grow rapidly can experience significant difficulties as a result. We may be unable to execute on aspects of our growth strategy to sustain our historical rate of growth or may be unable to grow at all. More specifically, we may be unable to generate sufficient new loans and deposits within acceptable risk and expense tolerances, obtain the personnel or funding necessary for additional growth or find suitable acquisition candidates. Various factors, such as economic conditions and competition, may impede or prohibit the growth of our operations, the opening of new branches and the consummation of acquisitions. Further, we may be unable to attract and retain experienced bankers, which could adversely affect our growth. The success of our strategy also depends on our ability to effectively manage growth, which is dependent upon a number of factors, including the ability to adapt existing credit, operational, technology and governance infrastructure to accommodate expanded operations. If we fail to build infrastructure sufficient to support rapid growth or fail to implement one or more aspects of our strategy, we may be unable to maintain historical earnings trends, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur recent acquisitions and growth and future expansion may result in additional risks.\nOver the last three years, we have completed the Community First Transaction and TCB Holdings Transaction. In addition, on October 22, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire FABK, the parent company for FAB. We expect to continue to expand in our current markets and in other select markets through additional branches or through additional acquisitions of all or part of other financial institutions. These types of expansions involve various risks, including the risks detailed below.\nGrowth. As a result of our acquisition activity and organic growth, we may be unable to successfully:\n\u2022\nmaintain acceptable loan quality in the context of significant loan growth;\n\u2022\nobtain regulatory and other approvals;\n\u2022\nattract or retain sufficient deposits and capital to fund anticipated loan growth;\n\u2022\nmaintain adequate common equity and regulatory capital;\n\u2022\navoid diversion or disruption of our existing operations or management as well as those of any acquired institution;\n\u2022\nmaintain adequate management personnel and systems to oversee and support such growth;\n\u2022\nmaintain adequate internal audit, loan review and compliance functions; and\n\u2022\nimplement additional policies, procedures and operating systems required to support such growth.\nResults of Operations. There is no assurance that existing offices or future offices will maintain or achieve deposit levels, loan balances or other operating results necessary to avoid losses or produce profits. Our growth strategy necessarily entails growth in overhead expenses as we routinely add new offices and staff. Our historical results may not be indicative of future results or results that may be achieved as we continue to increase the number and concentration of our branch offices in our newer markets.\nDevelopment of Offices. There are considerable costs involved in opening branches, and new branches generally do not generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs until they have been in operation for at least a year or more. Accordingly, any new branches we establish can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until they reach certain economies of scale. The same is true for our efforts to expand in current markets with the hiring of additional seasoned professionals with significant\nexperience in those markets. Our expenses could be further increased if we encounter delays in opening new branches. We may be unable to accomplish future branch expansion plans due to a lack of available satisfactory sites, difficulties in acquiring such sites, failure to receive any required regulatory approvals, increased expenses or loss of potential sites due to complexities associated with zoning and permitting processes, higher than anticipated merger and acquisition costs or other factors. Finally, we can have no assurance any branch will be successful even after it has been established or acquired, as the case may be.\nRegulatory and Economic Factors. Our growth and expansion plans may be adversely affected by a number of regulatory and economic developments or other events. Failure to obtain required regulatory approvals, changes in laws and regulations or other regulatory developments and changes in prevailing economic conditions or other unanticipated events may prevent or adversely affect our continued growth and expansion. Such factors may cause us to alter our growth and expansion plans or slow or halt the growth and expansion process, which may prevent us from entering into or expanding in our targeted markets or allow competitors to gain or retain market share in our existing markets.\nTransaction Termination. In connection with acquisitions, pending transactions carry the risk of not being completed and subject to contractual termination fees as well as reputational risk.\nFailure to successfully address these and other issues related to our expansionary activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Also, if our growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may face risks with respect to future acquisitions.\nWhen we attempt to expand our business through mergers and acquisitions (as we have done over the last several years), we seek targets that are culturally similar to us, have experienced management and possess either market presence or have potential for improved profitability through economies of scale or expanded services. In addition to the general risks associated with our growth plans, which are highlighted above, in general, acquiring other banks, businesses or branches, particularly those in markets with which we are less familiar, involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisition and merger targets;\n\u2022\ninaccuracies in the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution;\n\u2022\nthe time and costs associated with evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management, including as a result of de novo expansion into a market, and opening new bank locations, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the significant costs of the expansion that we may incur, particularly in the first 12 to 24 months of operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention to the negotiation of a transaction and integration of an acquired company\u2019s operations with ours;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of an impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and adverse effects on our results of operations;\n\u2022\nentry into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience;\n\u2022\nclosing delays and increased expenses related to the resolution of lawsuits filed by our shareholders or shareholders of companies we may seek to acquire;\n\u2022\nthe inability to receive regulatory approvals timely or at all, including as a result of community objections, or such approvals being restrictively conditional; and\n\u2022\nrisks associated with integrating the operations, technologies and personnel of an acquired business.\nWe expect to continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities that are presented to us in our current markets as well as other markets throughout the region and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash or equity securities and related capital raising transactions may occur at any time. Generally, acquisitions\nof financial institutions involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our book value and fully diluted earnings per share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in product presence and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may face significant competition from numerous other financial institutions, many of which may have greater financial resources than we do, when considering acquisition opportunities. Accordingly, attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any potential future acquisitions.\nReliant Bancorp and Reliant Bank are dependent on retaining and recruiting key individuals and the loss of one or more of these key individuals could curtail its growth and adversely affect its prospects.\nOur Company is materially dependent on the performance of our executive management team, loan officers, and other support personnel. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on the business of Reliant Bancorp and Reliant Bank and our results of operations and financial condition. Many of these key personnel have important customer relationships, which are instrumental to Reliant Bank\u2019s operations. Changes in key personnel and their responsibilities may be disruptive to Reliant Bancorp's and Reliant Bank\u2019s business and could have a material adverse effect on Reliant Bancorp's and Reliant Bank\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. Management believes that future results also will depend in part upon attracting and retaining highly skilled and qualified management, especially in the new market areas into which Reliant Bank may enter, as well as sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and management cannot be sure that Reliant Bank will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel.\nWe may be subject to environmental liabilities in connection with the foreclosure on real estate assets securing our loan portfolio.\nHazardous or toxic substances or other environmental hazards may be located on the properties that secure our loans. If we acquire such properties as a result of foreclosure or otherwise, we could become subject to various environmental liabilities. For example, we could be held liable for the cost of cleaning up or otherwise addressing contamination at or from these properties. We could also be held liable to a governmental entity or third party for property damage, personal injury or other claims relating to any environmental contamination at or from these properties. In addition, we may own and operate certain properties that may be subject to similar environmental liability risks during any given fiscal year. If we were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to increased credit losses and credit related expenses in the event of a major natural disaster, public health crisis, other catastrophic event or significant climate change effects.\nThe occurrence of a major natural or environmental disaster, public health crisis or similar catastrophic event, as well as significant climate change effects such as wildfires, especially in densely populated geographic areas, could increase our credit losses and credit related expenses. A natural disaster, public health crisis or catastrophic event or other significant climate change effect that either damages or destroys residential or multifamily real estate underlying mortgage loans or real estate collateral, or negatively affects the ability of borrowers to continue to make payments on loans, could increase our serious delinquency rates and average loan loss severity in the affected areas. Such events could also cause downturns in economic and market conditions generally, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. We may not have adequate insurance coverage for some of these natural, catastrophic, public health or climate change-related events.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund our operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity represents an institution\u2019s ability to provide funds to satisfy demands from depositors, borrowers and other creditors by either converting assets into cash or accessing new or existing sources of incremental funds. Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may be unable to satisfy current or future funding requirements and needs.\nThe objective of managing liquidity risk is to ensure that our cash flow requirements resulting from depositor, borrower and other creditor demands as well as our operating cash needs are met, and that our cost of funding such requirements and needs is reasonable. We maintain an asset/liability and interest rate risk policy and a liquidity and funds management policy, including a contingency funding plan, that, among other things, include procedures for managing and monitoring liquidity risk. Generally, we rely on deposits, repayments of loans and leases and cash flows from our investment securities as our primary sources of funds. Our principal deposit sources include consumer, commercial and public funds customers in our markets. We have used these funds, together with federal funds purchased and other sources of short-term and long-term borrowings, to make loans and leases, acquire investment securities and other assets and to fund continuing operations.\nAn inability to maintain or raise funds in amounts necessary to meet our liquidity needs could have a substantial negative effect on Reliant Bank\u2019s liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities, or on terms attractive to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. For example, factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us, a reduction in our credit rating, any damage to our reputation or any other decrease in depositor or investor confidence in our creditworthiness and business. Our access to liquidity could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as severe volatility or disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. Any such event or failure to manage our liquidity effectively could affect our competitive position, increase our borrowing costs and the interest rates we pay on deposits, limit our access to the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nDeposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, returns available to customers on alternative investments, general economic and market conditions and other factors. Loan and lease repayments are a relatively stable source of funds but are subject to the borrowers\u2019 and lessees\u2019 ability to repay loans and leases, which can be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in general economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups or specific businesses, declines in real estate values or markets, business closings or lay-offs, inclement weather, natural disasters and other factors. Furthermore, loans and leases generally are not readily convertible to cash. Accordingly, we may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet growth in demand for loans and leases, deposit withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such secondary sources include FHLB advances, brokered deposits, secured and unsecured federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks, Federal Reserve borrowings and/or accessing the equity or debt capital markets.\nWe anticipate we will continue to rely primarily on deposits, loan and lease repayments, and cash flows from our investment securities to provide liquidity. Additionally, where necessary, the secondary sources of borrowed funds described above will be used to augment our primary funding sources. If we are unable to access any of these secondary funding sources when needed, we might be unable to meet our customers\u2019 or creditors\u2019 needs, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nIf the underwriting quality of our mortgage loan originations is found to be deficient, our profitability could decrease, and we may incur losses.\nWe provide several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchases of their homes. We sell a large number of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market, and those loans are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor. Insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards, we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans, except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs. In the event that a substantial number of the loans that we have originated fall into default and the investors to whom we sold the loans determine that we did not underwrite the loans in accordance with their requirements, we could be required to repurchase the loans from the investors or indemnify the investors for any losses incurred. This may result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nReliant Bancorp\u2019s historical operating results may not be indicative of its future operating results.\nReliant Bancorp may not be able to sustain its historical rate of growth, and, consequently, Reliant Bancorp\u2019s historical results of operations will not necessarily be indicative of its future results of operations. Various factors, such as economic conditions, political, regulatory and legislative initiatives and considerations, and competition, may impede Reliant Bancorp\u2019s ability to expand its market presence. If Reliant Bancorp experiences a significant decrease in its historical rate of growth, Reliant Bancorp\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected because a high percentage of its operating costs are fixed expenses.\nReliant Bancorp may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose our Bank to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Bank cannot be realized on or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEconomic and other circumstances may require Reliant Bancorp to raise capital at times or in amounts that are unfavorable to it. If Reliant Bancorp has to issue shares of common stock, the issuance will dilute the percentage ownership interest of existing shareholders and may dilute the book value per share of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock and adversely affect the terms on which Reliant Bancorp may obtain additional capital.\nWe face significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, which could include the possibility of financing acquisitions. In addition, we, on a consolidated basis, and Reliant Bank, on a standalone basis, must meet certain regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. Importantly, regulatory capital requirements could increase from current levels, which could require us to raise additional capital or reduce our operations. Our ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance.\nReliant Bancorp may need to incur additional debt or equity financing in the future to make strategic acquisitions or investments or to strengthen its capital position. Reliant Bancorp\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and Reliant Bancorp\u2019s financial performance and condition. Reliant Bancorp cannot provide assurance that such financing will be available to Reliant Bancorp on acceptable terms or at all, or if Reliant Bancorp does raise additional capital that it will not be dilutive to existing shareholders.\nIf Reliant Bancorp determines, for any reason, that it needs to raise capital, Reliant Bancorp\u2019s board of directors generally has the authority, without action by or vote of Reliant Bancorp's shareholders, to issue all or part of any authorized but unissued shares of stock for any corporate purpose, including issuance of equity based incentives under or outside of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s equity compensation plans, subject to certain Nasdaq rules. Additionally, Reliant Bancorp is not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. The market price of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock could decline as a result of sales by Reliant Bancorp of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or from the perception that such sales could occur. If Reliant Bancorp issues preferred stock that has a preference over its common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or if Reliant Bancorp issues preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock, the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock could be adversely affected. Any issuance of additional shares of common stock will dilute the percentage ownership interest of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s shareholders and may dilute the book value per share of its common stock. Shares that Reliant Bancorp issues in connection with any such offering will increase the total number of shares outstanding and may dilute the economic and voting ownership interest of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s existing shareholders.\nReliant Bank faces strong competition for customers, which could prevent it from obtaining customers and may cause it to pay higher interest rates to attract customers.\nThe banking business is highly competitive, and Reliant Bank experiences competition in its markets from many other financial institutions. Reliant Bank competes with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other mutual funds, as\nwell as other super-regional, national, and international financial institutions that operate offices in Reliant Bank\u2019s primary market areas and elsewhere. Reliant Bank competes with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, Reliant Bank has to attract its customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents and businesses that have relocated to the Nashville MSA. Many of Reliant Bank\u2019s competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions. These institutions offer some services, such as extensive and established branch networks, that Reliant Bank does not provide. There is a risk that Reliant Bank will not be able to compete successfully with other financial institutions in Reliant Bank\u2019s markets, and that it may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits, resulting in reduced profitability. In addition, competitors that are not depository institutions are generally not subject to the extensive regulations that apply to Reliant Bank.\nNegative public opinion surrounding Reliant Bancorp and the financial institutions industry generally could damage our reputation and adversely impact its earnings.\nReputation risk, or the risk to Reliant Bancorp\u2019s business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion surrounding Reliant Bancorp or the financial institutions industry generally, is inherent in Reliant Bancorp\u2019s business. Negative public opinion can result from Reliant Bancorp\u2019s actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect Reliant Bancorp\u2019s ability to keep and attract clients and employees and can expose it to litigation and regulatory action. Although Reliant Bancorp takes steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with its clients and communities, this risk will always be present given the nature of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s business.\nWe may not be able to report our financial results accurately and timely as a publicly listed company if we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nAs a publicly traded company, we are required to file periodic reports containing our consolidated financial statements with the SEC within a specified time following the completion of quarterly and annual periods. Maintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures is necessary to identify information we must disclose in our periodic reports and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary to produce reliable financial statements and to prevent fraud. If we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures or effective internal control over financial reporting, we may experience difficulty in satisfying our SEC reporting obligations. Any failure by us to file our periodic reports with the SEC in a timely manner could harm our reputation and cause investors and potential investors to lose confidence in us and reduce the market price of our common stock, and could result in Nasdaq suspending or delisting our common stock.\nWe incur significant costs on an ongoing basis as a result of operating as a company whose ordinary shares are publicly traded in the United States, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance responsibilities, which will increase after we are no longer an emerging growth company.\nAs a company whose shares are publicly traded in the United States, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses on an ongoing basis for compliance purposes. In addition, the rules of the SEC and Nasdaq have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requirements for the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives.\nWhen the emerging growth company exemptions under the JOBS Act cease to apply, which we expect to occur on December 31, 2020, we expect to incur additional expenses and devote increased management effort toward ensuring compliance with increased reporting requirements. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of losing our emerging growth company status or the timing of such costs.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including but not limited to customer or employee fraud.\nEmployee errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee\nerrors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence. We maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against these operational risks. If our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including information contained in credit applications, property appraisals, title information, valuations and employment and income documentation, in deciding which loans we will originate as well as the terms of those loans. If any of the information upon which we rely is misrepresented, either fraudulently or inadvertently, and the misrepresentation is not detected prior to asset funding, the value of the asset may be significantly lower than expected, or we may fund a loan that we would not have funded or on terms we would not have extended.\nA failure in or breach of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s or Reliant Bank\u2019s computer or information technology systems or networks, or those of third parties, could disrupt our businesses and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations, as well as cause us reputational harm.\nThe potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization and, as a result of our interactions with and reliance on third parties, is not limited to our own internal operating functions. Our computer and information technology systems and networks, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our business and performance. We rely on our employees and third parties in the course of our day-to-day operations, any of whom may, as a result of human error, misconduct, malfeasance, or a failure or breach of systems or networks, expose us to risk. We have taken measures to implement backup systems and other safeguards to support our operations, but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions in or to our computer or information technology systems or networks or those of third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely. Our Company has also prepared and annually tests a business continuity plan that would be implemented in the event of a significant technological failure or if a current site become unavailable. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup, or other operating or security systems, or those of third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely, may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our or such third parties\u2019 control, which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services. There could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications, or other major physical infrastructure outages; newly identified vulnerabilities in key hardware or software; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods; disease pandemics; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts. In the event that backup systems are utilized, these systems may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been backed up. We continuously update the systems on which we rely to support our operations and to remain compliant with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including business interruptions. Operational risk exposures could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as cause us reputational harm.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes and we may not have the resources to implement new technology to stay current with these changes.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with new technology-driven products and services being frequently introduced. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to provide secure electronic environments as we continue to grow and expand our market area. Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest, and have invested significantly more than us, in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or more convenient products compared to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our customers, which could impair our growth and profitability.\nA cyber-attack, information or security breach, or technology failure, on our part or that of a third party, could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, or adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as cause us reputational harm.\nOur business is highly dependent on the security and integrity of our computer and information technology systems and networks, as well as those of third parties with whom we interact or on whom we rely. Our business is dependent on the secure processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our computer and information technology\nsystems and networks, and in the computer and information technology systems and networks of third parties. In addition, to access our networks, products, and services, our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own unique cybersecurity risks.\nWe and our third-party service providers and customers have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks. These cyber-attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denials of service or information, or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of confidential, proprietary, or other information of ours or of our employees or customers or third parties, as well as damages to our and third-party computer and information technology systems and networks and the disruption of our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 systems, networks, or business. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Despite efforts to protect the integrity of our systems and networks and implement controls, processes, policies, and other protective measures, cyber threats are rapidly evolving, and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches.\nCybersecurity risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions. For example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. In addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime groups, hackers, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists, and other external parties. Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Targeted social engineering attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. The techniques used by bad actors change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and may not be recognized until well after a breach has occurred. Additionally, the occurrence of cyber-attacks or security breaches involving third parties with access to our data, such as vendors, may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner.\nAlthough to date we have not experienced any material losses or other material consequences relating to technology failures, cyber-attacks, or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or other consequences in the future. Our risks associated with these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our size and scale, our role in the financial services industry, our plans to continue to implement our internet banking and mobile banking channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how they want to be served, our continuous transmission of sensitive information to, and storage of such information by, third parties, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, threats of cyber terrorism, and system and customer account updates and conversions. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes, policies, and other protective measures designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access remain a priority.\nWe also face indirect technology, cybersecurity, and operational risks relating to the customers and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities, including financial counterparties; financial intermediaries such as clearing agents, exchanges, and clearing houses; vendors; regulators; providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power; and retailers for whom we process transactions. As a result of increasing consolidation, interdependence, and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber-attack, or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes, or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including us. This consolidation, interdependence, and complexity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Any third-party technology failure, cyber-attack, or other information or security breach could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our customers, manage our exposure to risk, or operate or expand our businesses.\nCyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in material losses or have other material adverse consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber-attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, could damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our computer or information technology systems or networks could cause us negative consequences, including loss of customers and business opportunities, disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation or destruction of our confidential information or that of our customers, or damage to our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nReliant Bank could incur significant costs and expenses related to RMV, and these costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRMV provides mortgage banking services to Reliant Bank customers. Reliant Bank holds 51% of the governance rights in RMV and 30% of the financial rights in RMV. VHC is the other member of RMV and holds 49% of the governance rights in RMV and 70% of the financial rights in RMV. Under the terms of the RMV operating agreement, VHC is required to fund RMV\u2019s losses via additional capital contributions to RMV. RMV incurred a net loss of $5.66 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and has incurred cumulative net losses of $13.41 million since inception. Also, per the terms of the RMV operating agreement, VHC is to receive all distributions of cash flow from RMV until such time as VHC has recovered its capital contributions to RMV. After the return to VHC of its capital contributions, VHC is to receive 70% of RMV cash flow distributions and Reliant Bank is to receive 30% of RMV cash flow distributions. There can be no assurance that RMV will ever generate sufficient income to return to VHC its aggregate capital contributions or that Reliant Bank will ever receive cash flow distributions from RMV.\nTo date, VHC has not failed to make a required contribution of additional capital to RMV to cover losses incurred by the company. In the event VHC fails to make a required contribution of additional capital to cover losses of RMV, Reliant Bank has the right to cause the dissolution of RMV. However, in such event, Reliant Bank could also be required to fund losses of RMV not funded by VHC, which losses could be significant. Additionally, in the event Reliant Bank were to cause the dissolution of RMV, there would be costs and expenses associated with dissolving RMV and winding up the company\u2019s operations or integrating them with those of Reliant Bank, and those costs and expenses could be significant. Accordingly, VHC\u2019s failure to make a required contribution of additional capital to cover losses of RMV and/or Reliant Bank\u2019s decision to cause the dissolution of RMV in the event of such a failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nReliant Bancorp is an emerging growth company, and it cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make Reliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock less attractive to investors.\nReliant Bancorp is subject to periodic reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. Reliant Bancorp is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, however, and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if Reliant Bancorp chooses to comply with the reporting requirements applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, Reliant Bancorp may avail itself of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future, so long as Reliant Bancorp is an emerging growth company. Reliant Bancorp will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, which would end on December 31, 2020, though it may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including if, before the end of such five years, it is deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC (which depends on, among other things, having a market value of common stock held by non-affiliates in excess of $700 million) or if Reliant Bancorp\u2019s total annual gross revenues equal or exceed $1.07 billion in a fiscal year. Reliant Bancorp cannot predict if investors will find its common stock less attractive because it will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find Reliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for Reliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock and its stock price may be more volatile.\nFurther, the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. Reliant Bancorp has elected not to opt out of such an extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, Reliant Bancorp, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make Reliant Bancorp\u2019s financial statements not comparable with those of another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nThe amount of interest payable on the subordinated notes will vary beginning on December 15, 2024.\nOn December 13, 2019, Reliant Bancorp issued and sold $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.125% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2029 (the \u201cSubordinated Notes\u201d). The interest rate on the Subordinated Notes will vary\nbeginning on December 15, 2024. The Subordinated Notes will bear interest at an initial rate of 5.125%, payable semi-annually until December 15, 2024, at which time the Subordinated Notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) (provided, that in the event the three-month SOFR is less than zero, the three-month SOFR will be deemed to be zero), plus a spread of 376.5 basis points. If interest rates rise, the cost of the Subordinated Notes may increase, thereby negatively affecting our net income.\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $50.9 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. A significant decline in our financial condition, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates, or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Future acquisitions of other financial institutions could result in additional goodwill.\nRisks Related to Reliant Bancorp\u2019s Industry and Regulation\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision; compliance with new and existing legislation, regulations, and supervisory requirements and expectations could detrimentally affect our business.\nReliant Bancorp and Reliant Bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, the primary focus of which is to protect customers, depositors, the deposit insurance fund, and the safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole, and not shareholders. The quantity and scope of applicable federal and state regulations may place banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors such as finance companies, credit unions, and leasing companies. Banking and consumer lending laws and regulations apply to almost every aspect of our business, including lending, capital, investments, deposits, other services, and products, risk management, dividends, and acquisitions.\nLegislation and regulation with respect to our industry has increased in recent years, and we expect that federal and state supervision and regulation of our industry will continue to expand in scope and complexity. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, rules, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, rules, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in the interpretation or implementation of statutes, rule, regulations or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, and could subject us to additional costs, limits on the services and products we may offer, or limits on the pricing of banking services and products. In addition, establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with laws, rules and regulations increases our costs and could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\nIf we receive less than satisfactory results on regulatory examinations, we could be subject to damage to our reputation, significant fines and penalties, requirements to increase compliance and risk management activities, and an increase in our deposit insurance assessment rate, in addition to related costs and restrictions on acquisitions, new locations, new lines of business, or continued growth. Future changes in federal and state banking laws and regulations could adversely affect our operating results and ability to continue to compete effectively. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations subject us to additional restrictions, oversight and reporting obligations, which have significantly increased costs, although certain provisions of the Regulatory Relief Act may alleviate some of these burdens (however the impact of the Regulatory Relief Act is currently unknown because implementing rules and regulations are required in some instances and many of these implementing rules and regulations have not yet been written or finalized). Also, over the last several years, state and federal regulators have focused on enhanced risk management practices, compliance with the BSA and anti-money laundering laws, including the new beneficial ownership rule, data integrity and security, use of service providers, and fair lending and other consumer protection issues, which has increased our need to build additional processes and infrastructure. Government agencies charged with adopting and interpreting laws, rules and regulations may do so in an unforeseen manner, including in ways that potentially expand the reach of the laws, rules or regulations more than initially contemplated or currently anticipated. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation. Compliance with such current and potential legislation and regulation and increased regulatory scrutiny could significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. Our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new laws, rules and regulations.\nReliant Bank\u2019s FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments may increase.\nOur deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain deposit insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, we are required to pay quarterly deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. Although we cannot predict what the insurance assessment rates will be in the future, either deterioration in our risk-based capital ratios or adjustments to the base assessment rates could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to increased capital requirements, which may adversely impact return on equity or prevent us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies to establish stricter risk-based and leverage capital requirements to apply to banks and bank and savings and loan holding companies. In 2013, the federal banking agencies adopted revised risk-based and leverage capital requirements as well as a revised method for calculating risk-weighted assets. The capital rules apply to all bank holding companies with $1 billion or more in consolidated assets and all banks regardless of size.\nThe revised capital rules subjected us to higher required capital levels on January 1, 2015, with a phase-in period for certain provisions over four years that began in 2016. As of January 1, 2019, the capital requirements were fully phased in. The application of more stringent capital requirements on us could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions such as the inability to pay dividends or repurchase shares if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nOn October 29, 2019, pursuant to the Regulatory Relief Act, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to simplify the regulatory capital requirements for eligible community banks and holding companies that opt-in to the CBLR framework. Under the final rule, which became effective as of January 1, 2020, community banks and holding companies (which would include Reliant Bancorp and Reliant Bank) that satisfy certain qualifying criteria, including having less than $10 billion in average total consolidated assets and a leverage ratio of greater than 9%, would be eligible to opt-in to the CBLR framework. Presently, Reliant Bancorp and Reliant Bank do not intend to make this election.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for Reliant Bancorp or Reliant Bank could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the issuance of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if Reliant Bancorp or Reliant Bank were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nLaws and regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements relating to security breach notification, and we could be negatively impacted by them. For example, we are subject to the GLBA and related implementing regulations and guidance. Among other things, GLBA: (i) imposes certain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to share consumers\u2019 nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, (ii) requires that financial institutions provide certain disclosures to consumers about their information collection, sharing and security practices and affords consumers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of the institution\u2019s disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions) and (iii) requires financial institutions to develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution\u2019s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institution\u2019s activities, and the sensitivity of customer information processed by the financial institution as well as plans for responding to data security breaches.\nMoreover, various United States federal agencies, states and foreign jurisdictions have enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of required individual, consumer, regulatory and/or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Many of these requirements not only apply to us but also apply broadly to our partners that accept payments from our customers. In many countries that have yet to impose data security breach notification requirements, regulators have increasingly used the threat of significant sanctions and penalties by data protection authorities to encourage voluntary notification and discourage data security breaches.\nFurthermore, legislators and/or regulators in the United States are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and/or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. This could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. This includes increased privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level, by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as at the state level, such as with regard to mobile applications.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws (including those regarding security breach notification) affecting customer and/or employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation and our brand.\nAnti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us.\nWe maintain an enterprise-wide program designed to enable us to comply with applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations, including the BSA and the USA PATRIOT Act. This program includes policies, procedures, processes and other internal controls designed to identify, monitor, manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products, services, customers and geographic locale. These controls include procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions, perform customer due diligence, respond to requests from law enforcement, and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments. We cannot be sure our policies, procedures, processes and controls will be effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations, and our failure to comply could subject us to significant sanctions, fines, penalties and reputational harm, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nReliant Bancorp\u2019s stock price may fluctuate, which could result in losses to investors and litigation against Reliant Bancorp.\nReliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock is listed on Nasdaq. A number of factors could cause Reliant Bancorp\u2019s stock price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include but are not limited to: actual or anticipated variations in earnings, changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections, Reliant Bancorp\u2019s announcement of developments related to its businesses, operations and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers, new technology used or services offered by traditional and non-traditional competitors, news reports of trends, irrational exuberance on the part of investors, new federal banking laws, rules or regulations, and other matters related to the financial services industry. Reliant Bancorp\u2019s stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to its performance. General market declines or market volatility in the future, especially in the financial institutions sector, as well as natural disasters or public health issues, could adversely affect the price of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices. Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for Reliant Bancorp\u2019s shareholders to resell their common stock when desired and at prices they find attractive. Moreover, in the past, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against some companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Reliant Bancorp could in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from Reliant Bancorp\u2019s normal business.\nEven though our common stock is currently traded on Nasdaq, it has less liquidity than many other stocks quoted on a national securities exchange.\nThe trading volume in our common stock on Nasdaq has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on Nasdaq or other stock exchanges. Because of this, it may be more difficult for shareholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of our common stock in the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of our common stock. We can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market, or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market, would not cause the price of our common stock to decline or impair our future ability to raise capital through sales of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated, and may fluctuate significantly in the future. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market or industry price declines or overall market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.\nReliant Bancorp\u2019s ability to pay cash dividends is limited, and Reliant Bancorp may be unable to pay future dividends even if it desires to do so.\nEven though our board of directors has approved the payment of cash dividends on Reliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock in recent years, there can be no assurance as to whether or when we may pay dividends on our common stock in the future. Future dividends, if any, will be declared and paid at the discretion of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s board of directors and will depend on a number of factors. Reliant Bancorp\u2019s principal source of funds used to pay cash dividends on its common stock will be dividends that Reliant Bancorp receives from Reliant Bank. Although Reliant Bank\u2019s asset quality, earnings performance, liquidity, and capital requirements will be taken into account before Reliant Bancorp declares or pays any future dividends on its common stock, our board of directors will also consider our liquidity and capital requirements, and our board of directors could determine to declare and pay dividends without relying on dividend payments from Reliant Bank.\nFederal and state banking laws and regulations and state corporate laws restrict the amount of dividends we may declare and pay and that Reliant Bank may declare and pay to Reliant Bancorp. For example, Federal Reserve regulations implementing the capital rules required under Basel III do not permit dividends unless capital levels exceed certain higher levels applying capital conservation buffers that became fully phased in beginning January 1, 2019.\nIn addition, Reliant Bancorp must make payments on the subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) and the Subordinated Notes before any dividends can be paid on its common stock. Reliant Bancorp may also from time to time enter into other contractual arrangements, including borrowing relationships with other financial institutions, that could limit the ability of Reliant Bancorp to pay dividends on its common stock in the future.\nWe may issue additional common stock or other equity securities in the future which could dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders.\nIn order to maintain our or Reliant Bank\u2019s capital at desired or regulatory-required levels, we may issue additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or representing rights to acquire shares of common stock. We may sell these shares at prices below the current market price for shares of Reliant Bancorp common stock, and the sale of these shares may significantly dilute existing shareholder ownership. We could also issue additional shares in connection with acquisitions of other financial institutions (as we did in connection with our acquisition of Community First and TCB Holdings and as contemplated in our pending acquisition of FABK), which could also dilute existing shareholder ownership.\nHolders of our debt obligations have rights that are senior to those of our shareholders.\nIn connection with the Community First acquisition, Reliant Bancorp assumed trust preferred securities and accompanying junior subordinated debentures totaling $23.0 million, of which $10.0 million was owned by Community First prior to the acquisition and assumed by Reliant Bancorp. On December 13, 2019, Reliant Bancorp issued and sold the Subordinated Notes. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities are conditionally guaranteed by Reliant Bancorp, and the accompanying subordinated debentures and the Subordinated Notes are senior to shares of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock. As a result, Reliant Bancorp must make payments on the subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) and the Subordinated Notes before any dividends can be paid on its common stock and, in the event of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the subordinated debentures and the Subordinated Notes must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on Reliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock.\nReliant Bancorp may from time to time issue additional subordinated indebtedness that would have to be repaid before Reliant Bancorp\u2019s shareholders would be entitled to receive any of the assets of Reliant Bancorp or Reliant Bank.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nAs a smaller company, it may be difficult for us to attract or retain the interest of equity research analysts. A lack of research coverage may adversely affect the liquidity of and market price of our common stock. We will not have any control over the equity research analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts\nceases coverage of our company, or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nShares of Reliant Bancorp common stock are not FDIC insured.\nAn investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss or guaranteed by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. An investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described herein. As a result, if you acquire our common stock, you could lose some or all of your investment.", "PERMNO": 15505, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "RBNC"}
