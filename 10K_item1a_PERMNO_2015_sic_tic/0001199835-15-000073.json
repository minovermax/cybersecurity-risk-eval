RISK FACTORS\nThe following disclosures should be read in conjunction with Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These disclosures are intended to discuss certain material risks of the Company\u2019s business as they appear to Management at this time. However, this list is not exhaustive. Other risks may, and likely will, arise from time to time.\nAgricultural risks could adversely affect the Company\nWinemaking and grape growing are subject to a variety of agricultural risks. Various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frost and certain other weather conditions can affect the quantity of grapes available to the Company, decreasing the supply of the Company\u2019s products and negatively impacting profitability. In particular, certain of the Company\u2019s vines are not resistant to phylloxera; accordingly, those vines are particularly at risk to the effects from an infestation of phylloxera. Phylloxera is a pest that attacks the rootstocks of wine grape plants. Vineyards in the United States, including some in Oregon and some owned by us, have been infested in recent years with phylloxera. Since May of 1992, the Company\u2019s vineyard properties have been planted with rootstocks believed to be resistant to phylloxera. However, rootstocks planted by the Company prior to 1992 are not resistant. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s existing vineyards, or the rootstocks the Company is now using in its planting programs, will not become susceptible to current or new strains of phylloxera. Pierce\u2019s Disease is a vine bacterial disease. It kills grapevines and there is no known cure. Small insects called Sharpshooters spread this disease. A new strain of the Sharpshooter was discovered in Southern California and is believed to be migrating north. The Company is actively supporting the efforts of the agricultural industry to control this pest and is making every reasonable effort to prevent an infestation in its own vineyards. The Company cannot, however, guarantee that it will succeed in preventing contamination in its vineyards. Future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in grape growing may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production. Additionally, long-term changes in weather patterns could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company may not be able to grow or acquire enough quality fruit for its wines\nThe adequacy of the Company\u2019s grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industry-wide production levels. While the Company believes that it can secure sufficient supplies of grapes from a combination of its own production and from grape supply contracts with independent growers, the Company cannot be certain that grape supply shortages will not occur. A shortage in the supply of wine grapes could result in an increase in the price of some or all grape varieties and a corresponding increase in wine production costs.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nLoss of key employees could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and business\nThe Company\u2019s success depends to some degree upon the continued service of a number of key employees. The loss of the services of one or more of these key employees, including James W. Bernau, our President, and Richard F. Goward Jr., our Chief Financial Officer, could harm the Company and its reputation and negatively impact its profitability, particularly if one or more of the Company\u2019s key employees resigns to join a competitor or to form a competing company.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to operate requires utilization of the line of credit\nThe Company\u2019s cash flow from operations historically has not been sufficient to provide all funds necessary for the Company\u2019s operations. The Company has entered into a line of credit agreement to provide such funds and entered into term loan arrangements, the proceeds of which were used to acquire the Tualatin Winery and the Tualatin Vineyards, construct and remodel the Hospitality Center and pay down the Company\u2019s revolving line of credit. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to comply with all conditions under its credit facilities in the future or that the amount available under the line of credit facility will be adequate for the Company\u2019s future needs. Failure to comply with all conditions of the credit facilities, or to have sufficient funds for operations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and shareholder value.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company\u2019s outstanding indebtedness was approximately $5.2 million and the Company had a line of credit balance of $0 on a maximum borrowing amount of $2 million.\nCosts of being a publicly-held company may put the Company at a competitive disadvantage\nAs a public company, the Company incurs substantial costs that are not incurred by its competitors that are privately-held. These compliance costs may result in the Company\u2019s wines being more expensive than those produced by its competitors and/or may reduce profitability compared to such competitors.\nThe Company faces significant competition which could adversely affect profitability\nThe wine industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented. The Company\u2019s wines compete in several premium wine market segments with many other premium domestic and foreign wines, with imported wines coming from the Burgundy and Bordeaux regions of France, as well as Italy, Chile, Argentina, South Africa and Australia. The Company\u2019s wines also compete with popular priced generic wines and with other alcoholic and, to a lesser degree, non-alcoholic beverages, for shelf space in retail stores and for marketing focus by the Company\u2019s independent distributors, many of which carry extensive brand portfolios. A result of this intense competition has been and may continue to be upward pressure on the Company\u2019s selling and promotional expenses. In addition, the wine industry has experienced significant consolidation. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and public relations resources than the Company does. Company sales may be harmed to the extent it is not able to compete successfully against such wine or alternative beverage producers\u2019 costs. There can be no assurance that in the future the Company will be able to successfully compete with its current competitors or that it will not face greater competition from other wineries and beverage manufacturers.\nThe Company competes for shelf space in retail stores and for marketing focus by its independent distributors, most of whom carry extensive product portfolios\nNationwide, the Company sells its products primarily through independent distributors and brokers for resale to retail outlets, restaurants, hotels and private clubs across the United States and in some overseas markets. Sales to distributors are expected to continue to represent a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s net revenue in the future. A change in the relationship with any of the Company\u2019s significant distributors could harm the Company\u2019s business and reduce Company sales. The laws and regulations of several states prohibit changes of distributors, except under certain limited circumstances, making it difficult to terminate a distributor for poor performance without reasonable cause, as defined by applicable statutes. Any difficulty or inability to replace distributors, poor performance of the Company\u2019s major distributors or the Company\u2019s inability to collect accounts receivable from its major distributors could harm the Company\u2019s business. There can be no assurance that the distributors and retailers the Company uses will continue to purchase the Company\u2019s products or provide Company products with adequate levels of promotional support.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nConsolidation at the retail tier, among club and chain grocery stores in particular, can be expected to heighten competitive pressure to increase marketing and sales spending or constrain or reduce prices.\nFluctuations in quantity and quality of grape supply could adversely affect the Company\nA shortage in the supply of quality grapes may result from a variety of factors that determine the quality and quantity of the Company\u2019s grape supply, including weather conditions, pruning methods, diseases and pests, the ability to buy grapes on long and short term contracts and the number of vines producing grapes. Any shortage in the Company\u2019s grape production could cause a reduction in the amount of wine the Company is able to produce, which could reduce sales and adversely impact the Company\u2019s results from operations. Factors that reduce the quantity of the Company\u2019s grapes may also reduce their quality, which in turn could reduce the quality or amount of wine the Company produces. Deterioration in the quality of the Company\u2019s wines could harm its brand name and could reduce sales and adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nContamination of the Company\u2019s wines would harm the Company\u2019s business\nThe Company is subject to certain hazards and product liability risks, such as potential contamination, through tampering or otherwise, of ingredients or products. Contamination of any of the Company\u2019s wines could cause it to destroy its wine held in inventory and could cause the need for a product recall, which could significantly damage the Company\u2019s reputation for product quality. The Company maintains insurance against certain of these kinds of risks, and others, under various insurance policies. However, the insurance may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at a price or on terms that are satisfactory to the Company and this insurance may not be adequate to cover any resulting liability.\nA reduction in consumer demand for premium wines could harm the Company\u2019s business\nThere have been periods in the past in which there were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol products in the United States and other markets in which the Company participates. A limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of the Company\u2019s product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including: a general decline in economic conditions; increased concern about the health consequences of consuming alcoholic beverage products and about drinking and driving; a trend toward a healthier diet including lighter, lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks, juices and water products; the increased activity of anti-alcohol consumer groups; and increased federal, state or foreign excise and other taxes on beverage alcohol products. The competitive position of the Company\u2019s products could also be affected adversely by any failure to achieve consistent, reliable quality in the product or service levels to customers.\nChanges in consumer spending could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and business results\nWine sales depend upon a number of factors related to the level of consumer spending, including the general state of the economy, federal and state income tax rates, deductibility of business entertainment expenses under federal and state tax laws, and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. Changes in consumer spending in these and other regions can affect both the quantity and the price of wines that customers are willing to purchase at restaurants or through retail outlets. Reduced consumer confidence and spending may result in reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products, limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to increase prices and increased levels of selling and promotional expenses. This, in turn, may have a considerable negative impact upon the Company\u2019s sales and profit margins.\nIncreased regulation could adversely affect the Company\nThe wine industry is subject to extensive regulation by the Federal Alcohol Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (\u201cTTB\u201d) and various foreign agencies, state liquor authorities, such as the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (\u201cOLCC\u201d), and local authorities. These regulations and laws dictate such matters as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, permitted distribution channels, permitted and required labeling, and advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers. Any expansion of the Company\u2019s existing facilities or development of new vineyards or wineries may be limited by present and future zoning ordinances, environmental restrictions and other legal requirements. In addition, new regulations or requirements or increases in excise taxes, income taxes, property and sales taxes or international tariffs, could negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. Recently, many states have considered proposals to increase, and some of these states have increased, state alcohol excise taxes. New or revised regulations, or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that new or revised regulations or increased licensing fees and requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and its results of operations and its cash flows.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is thinly traded, and therefore not as liquid as other investments.\nThe trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock on NASDAQ is consistently \u201cthin,\u201d in that there is not a great deal of trading activity on a daily basis. Because the average active trading volume is thin, there is less opportunity for shareholders to sell their shares of the Company\u2019s common stock on the open market, resulting in the common stock being less liquid than common stock in other publicly traded companies.", "PERMNO": 80955, "SIC": 2084, "TIC": "WVVI"}
