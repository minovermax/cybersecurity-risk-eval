{"cik": "1549966", "company": "Silvercrest Asset Management Group Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to our Investment Performance and the Financial Markets\nVolatile market conditions could adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value of our assets under management and causing clients to withdraw funds, either of which could materially reduce our revenues, adversely affect our financial condition and earnings, and expose us to litigation risks.\nThe fees we earn under our investment management agreements with clients are based on the value of our assets under management. The prices of the securities held in the portfolios we manage and, therefore, our assets under management, may decline due to any number of factors beyond our control, including, among others, a declining stock or bond market, general economic downturn, political uncertainty, natural disasters or pandemics (including the most recent coronavirus outbreak), acts of terrorism or other catastrophic or geopolitical events. In periods of difficult market conditions, we may experience accelerated client redemptions or withdrawals if clients move assets to investments they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk, which could further reduce our assets under management in addition to market depreciation. The economic outlook remains uncertain and we continue to operate in a challenging business environment. If market conditions, or actions taken by clients in response to market conditions, cause a decline in our assets under management, it would result in lower investment management fees and other revenue. If our revenues decline without a commensurate reduction in our expenses, our net income will be reduced, and our business will be negatively affected. In addition, while we seek to deliver long-term value to our clients, volatility may lead to under-performance in the near term, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf market conditions improve greatly, driving the prices of the securities in our clients\u2019 accounts higher, it may lead to withdrawals or redemptions. In many cases, we advise only a portion of our clients\u2019 complete financial portfolio. This is because many clients prefer to diversify their portfolio among more than one asset manager or investment type. As to those clients, if the portion of their portfolio held by us increases significantly, it may become too large a percentage of their overall portfolio, and they may withdraw assets from our management and invest it elsewhere, thereby rebalancing their overall portfolio and returning their allocation to us to its prior level.\nThe performance of our investment strategies is critical to retaining existing client assets and to attracting new client assets. Our investment strategies may perform poorly for various reasons, including general market conditions, our investment decisions, and the performance of the companies in which we invest on our clients\u2019 behalf. If our investment strategies perform poorly, on an absolute basis or relative to other investment advisers, or if the rankings of mutual funds we sub-advise decline, our clients may withdraw funds or terminate their relationships with us and investors in the mutual funds we sub-advise may redeem their investments, which may cause the revenues that we generate from investment management and other fees to decline. Further, third-party financial intermediaries, advisers, or consultants may rate our investment products poorly, which may lead our existing clients to withdraw funds from our investment strategies or reduce asset inflows from these third parties or their clients.\nWhile clients do not generally have legal recourse against us due to poor investment results, if our investment strategies perform poorly, we are more likely to be subject to litigation brought by dissatisfied clients. In addition, if clients are successful in claiming that their losses resulted from fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct, breach of contract or other similar misconduct, these clients may have remedies against us and/or our investment professionals under the federal securities laws and/or state law.\nWe may not be able to maintain our current fee structure as a result of poor investment performance, competitive pressures or as a result of changes in our business mix, which could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations.\nIn recent years, there has been a general trend toward lower fees in the investment management industry. Some of our investment strategies, because they tend to invest in larger-capitalization companies and are designed with larger capacity and to appeal to larger clients, have lower fee schedules. In order to maintain our fee structure in a competitive environment, we must be able to continue to provide investment returns and service that our clients believe justify our fees. If our investment strategies perform poorly, we may be forced to lower our fees in order to retain and attract assets to manage. Furthermore, if an increased part of our assets under management are invested in our larger capacity, lower fee strategies, our revenue could be adversely affected.\nThe historical returns of our existing investment strategies may not be indicative of future results or of future results of investment strategies that we may develop.\nWe have outlined the historical returns of our existing investment strategies under the \u201cBusiness\u201d heading in this report. The historical returns of our strategies should not be considered indicative of the future results of these strategies or of the results of any other strategies that we may develop in the future. The investment performance we achieve for our clients varies over time and the variance can be wide. The historical performance presented herein is as of December 31, 2021 and for the period then ended. The performance we achieve as of a subsequent date and for a subsequent period may be higher or lower and the difference may be material. Our strategies\u2019 returns have benefited during some periods from investment opportunities and positive economic and market conditions. In certain periods, general economic and market conditions have negatively affected investment opportunities and our strategies\u2019 returns. These negative conditions may occur again, and in the future, we may not be able to identify and invest in profitable investment opportunities within our current or future strategies.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of strategies and clients.\nAs of December 31, 2021, $24.6 billion of our assets under management were concentrated in discretionary managed accounts, and the revenue from these discretionary managed accounts represented approximately 96% of our investment management fees for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. In addition, $0.5 billion of our assets under management were invested in private partnerships as of December 31, 2021, and the revenue from these private partnerships represented approximately 4% of our investment management fees for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. As a result, a substantial portion of our operating results depends upon the performance of a limited number of investment strategies used to manage those discretionary managed accounts and private partnerships, and our ability to retain client assets. If a significant portion of the investors in our larger strategies withdrew their investments or terminated their investment management agreements for any reason, including poor investment performance or adverse market conditions, our revenues from those strategies would decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFurthermore, certain of our strategies may derive a significant portion of their total assets under management from assets of a single client or a small number of clients. If any such clients withdraw all or a portion of their assets under management, our business would be significantly affected, which would negatively impact our investment management fees and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nSubstantially all of our revenue generating contracts and relationships may be terminated upon no notice.\nWe derive our revenues principally from our assets under management, which may be reduced by our clients, or investors in the mutual funds we sub-advise, at any time. Any client may reallocate all or a portion of their assets under management with us at any time, on little to no notice. In addition, investors in the mutual funds we advise can redeem their investments in those funds at any time without prior notice. Further, our investment management agreements may be terminated or not renewed by our clients upon short notice or no notice, for any reason. The decrease in revenues that could result from a reduction in assets under management or the termination of a material client relationship or group of client relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur long-only, equity investment focus may not obtain attractive returns in the short-term or during certain market periods and may expose us to greater risk than if our investment strategies included non-equity securities or hedged positions.\nEven when securities prices are rising generally, portfolio performance may be affected by our investment approach. Our investment strategies employ a long-term investment approach, which has outperformed the market in some economic and market environments and underperformed it in others. A prolonged period in which the growth style of investing outperforms the value style may cause portions of our investment strategy to go out of favor with some clients, consultants, or third-party intermediaries. Poor performance relative to peers, coupled with changes in personnel, unfavorable market environments or other difficulties may result in significant withdrawals of client or investor assets, client or investor departures or otherwise result in a reduction in our assets under management.\nOur products are best suited for investors with long-term investment horizons. In order for our classic value investment approach to yield attractive returns, we must typically hold securities for an average of over three years. Therefore, our investment strategies may not perform well during short periods of time. In addition, our strategies may not perform well during points in the economic cycle when value-oriented stocks are relatively less attractive. For instance, during the late stages of an economic cycle or during periods where the markets are focused on one investment thesis or sector, investors may purchase relatively expensive stocks in order to obtain access to above average growth, as was the case in the late 1990s.\nOur largest equity investment strategies hold long positions in publicly traded equity securities of companies across a wide range of market capitalizations, geographies and industries. Accordingly, when there is a general decline in the value of equity securities, each of our equity strategies is likely to perform poorly on an absolute basis. Aside from our privately managed funds and funds of funds, we do not have strategies that invest in privately held companies or take short positions in equity securities, which could offset some of the poor performance of our long-only, equity strategies. Even if our investment performance remains strong during declining market conditions relative to other long-only, equity strategies, investors may withdraw assets from our management or allocate a larger portion of their assets to non-long-only or non-equity strategies. In addition, the prices of equity securities may fluctuate more widely than the prices of other types of securities, making the level of our assets under management and related revenues more volatile.\nThe performance of our investment strategies or the growth of our assets under management may be constrained by the unavailability of appropriate investment opportunities.\nOur investment performance depends in large part on our investment teams\u2019 ability to identify appropriate investment opportunities. If any of our investment teams are unable to timely identify sufficiently appropriate investment opportunities for existing and new client assets, the investment performance of the relevant investment strategy could be adversely affected. In addition, if we determine that there are insufficient investment opportunities available for a strategy, we may restrict the strategy\u2019s growth by closing the strategy to all or substantially all new investors or otherwise taking action to limit the flow of assets into the strategy. If we misjudge the point at which it would be optimal to limit access to or close a strategy, the strategy\u2019s investment performance could be negatively impacted. The availability of sufficiently appropriate investment opportunities is influenced by a number of factors, including general market conditions. The risk that such opportunities may be unavailable is particularly acute with respect to our small cap and smid cap strategies that focus on small-cap investments, and is likely to increase as our assets under management increase, particularly if these increases occur very rapidly. If we are unable to identify appropriate investment opportunities, our growth and results of operations may be negatively affected. As of the filing of this annual report, our small cap value strategy is closed to new investors. The strategy may be reopened if one or more of our investors elects to rebalance its assets, which may occur at any time.\nOur investment process requires us to conduct extensive fundamental research on any company before investing in it, which may result in missed investment opportunities and reduce the performance of our investment strategies.\nBefore we add any security to our portfolio, we undergo an in-depth research process, which takes a considerable amount of time, in order to understand the company and the business well enough to make an informed decision as to whether we are willing to own a significant position in a company, whose current earnings are below its historic norms and that does not yet have earnings visibility. However, the time we take to make this judgment may cause us to miss the opportunity to invest in a company that has a sharp and rapid earnings recovery. Any such missed investment opportunity could adversely impact the performance of our investment strategies.\nOur International Equity Strategies invest principally in the securities of non-U.S. companies, which involve foreign currency exchange, tax, political, social and economic uncertainties and risks.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our international equity strategies, which invest primarily in companies domiciled outside of the United States, accounted for approximately 1.1% of our assets under management. In addition, some of our other strategies also invest on a more limited basis in securities of non-U.S. companies. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect the returns of our clients who are invested in these strategies. In addition, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to non-U.S. currencies is likely to result in a decrease in the U.S. dollar value of our assets under management, which, in turn, could result in lower revenue since we report our financial results in U.S. dollars.\nInvestments in non-U.S. issuers may also be affected by tax positions taken in countries or regions in which we are invested, as well as political, social and economic uncertainty, particularly as a result of the recent decline in economic conditions. Declining tax revenues may cause governments to assert their ability to tax the local gains and/or income of foreign investors (including our clients), which could adversely affect clients\u2019 interests in investing outside the United States. Many financial markets are not as developed, or as efficient, as the U.S. financial markets, and, as a result, those markets may have limited liquidity and higher price volatility. Liquidity also may be adversely affected by political or economic events within a particular country, and our ability to dispose of an investment also may be adversely affected if we increase the size of our investments in smaller non-U.S. issuers. Non-U.S. legal and regulatory environments, including financial accounting standards and practices, also may be different, and there may be less publicly available information about such companies. These risks could adversely affect the performance of our International Equity Strategies and may be particularly acute in the emerging or less developed markets in which we invest.\nRisks Related to Our Growth\nOur efforts to establish new investment teams and strategies may be unsuccessful and could negatively impact our results of operations and our reputation.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may seek to take advantage of opportunities to add new investment teams. To the extent we are unable to recruit and retain investment teams that complement our business model, we may not successfully diversify our investment strategies and client assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and future prospects. In addition, the costs associated with establishing a new team and investment strategy initially will exceed the revenues they generate. If any such new strategies perform poorly or fail to attract sufficient assets to manage, our results of operations and reputation and the reputation of our investment strategies may be negatively impacted.\nWe may enter into new lines of business, make strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into joint ventures, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties for our business.\nSubject to market conditions, we may choose to grow our business through, among other things, (i) increasing assets under management in existing investment strategies, (ii) pursuing new investment strategies, which may be similar or complementary to our existing strategies or be wholly new initiatives, or (iii) consummating acquisitions of other investment advisers or entering into joint ventures.\nMaking strategic investments or acquisitions and entering into strategic relationships, joint ventures, or new lines of business, involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including those associated with investment of capital and other resources and with combining or integrating operational and management systems and controls and managing potential conflicts. Entry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. If a new business generates insufficient revenues, produces investment losses, or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations, our results of operations will be adversely affected, and our reputation and business may be harmed. In the case of joint ventures, we are subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to, systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control.\nWe may be unable to successfully execute strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into joint ventures, and we may fail to successfully integrate and operate new investment teams, which could limit our ability to grow assets under management and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAlthough we periodically consider strategic investments or acquisitions as part of our growth strategy, we have not at this time entered into any binding agreements with respect to any strategic investments or acquisitions or any strategic relationships or joint ventures and we cannot assure you that we will actually make any additional acquisitions. Our ability to execute our acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify new lines of businesses or new investment teams that meet our investment criteria and to successfully negotiate with the owners/managers who may not wish to give up control of the target fund general partner or managing member, as the case may be. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in finding new investment teams or investing in new lines of business or that they will have favorable operating results following our acquisitions.\nMoreover, our future acquisition strategies may focus on privately-held asset managers that pursue single strategy specialized investments. This approach presents challenges, including the lack of publicly available information, and greater risks than are generally associated with transactions with more traditional asset managers. The asset managers that we may acquire and their financial information may not be subject to the reporting requirements and other rules that govern public companies, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley. Moreover, such asset managers may not be subject to regulation under the Advisers Act and/or the Commodity Exchange Act at the time we acquire them. As a result, such asset managers could be more susceptible to irregular accounting or fraudulent practices. The targets we seek to acquire in the future may have shorter operating histories than us on which to estimate future performance and may not have significant or any operating revenues. They also may have a lower capitalization and fewer resources (including cash) and be more vulnerable to failure than traditional asset managers. We will be required to rely on the ability of the professionals employed by us to obtain adequate information to evaluate the manager affiliates we seek to acquire.\nIn addition, our ability to acquire asset managers on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them is subject to the following significant risks:\n\u2022we may acquire asset managers that are not accretive to our financial results upon acquisition, and we may not successfully manage acquired funds to meet our expectations;\n\u2022we may be unable to generate sufficient management fees from operations or obtain the necessary debt or equity financing to consummate an acquisition on favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022agreements for the acquisition of such asset managers will typically be subject to customary conditions to closing, including satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and negotiation of ancillary documentation, and we may spend significant time and money on potential acquisitions that we do not consummate;\n\u2022the process of acquiring or pursuing the acquisition of such asset managers may divert the attention of our management team from the operations of our business and our initial funds;\n\u2022we will need to attract, hire, train, supervise and manage new employees as a result of the acquisitions of asset managers;\n\u2022we may acquire such asset managers without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, for liabilities, whether known or unknown, such as claims against the former owners of the asset managers and claims for indemnification by the asset managers, limited partners and others indemnified by the former owners of the managers of the funds; and\n\u2022we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions into our existing operations.\nIf we cannot complete acquisitions of such asset managers on favorable terms, or integrate or operate new investment teams to meet our goals or expectations, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy any debt service obligations and to pay distributions could be adversely affected. Additionally, any acquisitions that we make generally will not be subject to our stockholders\u2019 consent. These factors increase the risk of investing in our Class A common stock.\nThe due diligence process that we undertake in connection with strategic investments or acquisitions or entry into joint ventures may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with an investment, which could subject us to unknown liabilities.\nIn connection with strategic investments, acquisitions or entry into joint ventures, we conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to such investments, acquisitions or joint ventures and expect to use our resources and oversight to enhance the risk management functions and diligence of our business and any investments going forward. When conducting due diligence, we have been required and will be required to evaluate important and complex business, financial, tax, accounting and legal issues. Outside consultants, legal advisers, accountants and investment banks may be involved in the due diligence process in the future in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. When conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding a strategic investment, acquisition or joint venture, we have and will continue to rely on the resources available to us, including information provided by the target of the strategic investment, acquisition or joint venture, in some circumstances, third-party investigations. The due diligence investigations that we have carried out or will carry out with respect to any strategic investment, acquisition or joint venture may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating the strategic investment, acquisition or joint venture, which could subject us to unknown liabilities that could adversely affect our profitability, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, such investigations will not necessarily result in the strategic investment, acquisition or joint venture being successful.\nThe significant growth we have experienced may be difficult to sustain.\nOur assets under management have increased from $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2006 to $32.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. The absolute measure of our assets under management represents a significant rate of growth that may be difficult to sustain. The growth of our business will depend on, among other things, our ability to retain key investment professionals, to devote sufficient resources to maintaining existing investment strategies and to selectively develop new investment strategies. Our business growth also will depend on our success in achieving superior investment performance from our investment strategies, as well as our ability to maintain and extend our distribution capabilities, to deal with changing market conditions, to maintain adequate financial and business controls and to comply with new legal and regulatory requirements arising in response to both the increased sophistication of the investment management industry and the significant market and economic events of the last few years. If we believe that in order to continue to produce attractive returns from some or all of our investment strategies we should limit the growth of those strategies, we have in the past chosen, and in the future may choose, to limit or close access to those strategies to some or most categories of new investors or clients or otherwise take action to slow the flow of assets into those strategies.\nIn addition, we expect there to be significant demand on our infrastructure and investment teams and we may not be able to manage our growing business effectively or be able to sustain the level of growth we have achieved historically, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and control our expenses.\nRisks Related to our Key Professionals\nThe loss of key investment professionals or members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on the skills and expertise of our investment professionals and our success depends on our ability to retain the key members of our senior management and investment teams, who possess substantial experience in investing and have been primarily responsible for the historically strong investment performance we have achieved. In particular, we depend on our portfolio managers. As of December 31, 2021, $15 billion, representing 47% of our assets under management, were managed using one of our proprietary equity strategies. Our five largest strategies as of December 31, 2021 were Small Cap Value, Equity Income, Large Cap Value, Multi Cap Value and Small Cap Opportunity which represented 27%, 18%, 18%, 12% and 8% of assets under management, respectively. Each of these five strategies has been managed by its current portfolio manager since its inception at Silvercrest.\nBecause of the long tenure and stable track record of our portfolio managers, our clients may attribute the investment performance we have achieved to these individuals. While we have generally experienced very few departures among our portfolio managers, there can be no assurance that this stability will continue in the future. The departure of one of a strategy\u2019s portfolio managers could cause clients to withdraw funds from the strategy, which would reduce our assets under management, our investment management and other fees and, if we were not able to reduce our expenses sufficiently, our net income, and these reductions could be material to our business. The departure of one of a strategy\u2019s portfolio managers also could cause clients or investors to refrain from allocating additional funds to the strategy or delay such allocation of additional funds until a sufficient track record under a new portfolio manager or managers has been established. This would have a negative effect on the future growth of our assets under management and, therefore, our results of operations.\nWe depend on the contributions of our senior management team led by Richard R. Hough III, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as well as other members of our senior management team. In addition, our senior marketing and client service personnel have direct contact with our clients and their consultants and advisors and other key individuals within each of our distribution channels. The loss of any of these key professionals could limit our ability to successfully execute our business strategy, prevent us from sustaining the historically strong investment performance and adversely affect our ability to retain or attract client assets.\nIf any member of our senior management or a key investment professional were to join a competitor or form a competing company, some of our current clients or other prominent members of the investing community could choose to invest with that competitor rather than us.\nCertain of our investment or management professionals have resigned and joined a competitor, and others may resign at any time, join our competitors or form competing companies. Although the unvested shares of Class A common stock and Class B units held by our principals are subject to forfeiture, and the vested shares of Class A common stock and Class B units held by our principals are subject to repurchase, if the principal voluntarily resigns or retires and competes with us while employed or during the 12-month period following termination of employment, these forfeiture and repurchase provisions may not be enforceable or may not be enforceable to their full extent. We do not carry \u201ckey man\u201d insurance on any of our key investment professionals that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of any of the key members of our investment or management teams.\nThe professional reputations, expertise in investing and client relationships of our senior management and key investment professionals are important elements to executing our business strategy and attracting and retaining clients. Accordingly, the retention of our senior management and key investment professionals is a key element to our future success. There is no guarantee that they will not resign, join our competitors or form a competing company. The terms of the second amended and restated limited partnership agreement of Silvercrest L.P. restrict each of the principals of Silvercrest L.P. from soliciting our clients or other employees during the term of their employment with us and for 18 months thereafter. In addition to the legal rights and remedies available to us to enforce these restrictive covenants, the penalty for a breach of these restrictive covenants or, if a principal voluntarily resigns or retires from our company, for competing with us during the 12-month period following termination of employment, will be the forfeiture of all of the unvested shares of Class A common stock and Class B units of the offending party and his or her permitted transferees and, at the option of Silvercrest L.P., the required sale to Silvercrest L.P. of all of the vested Class B units of the offending party and his or her permitted transferees at a purchase price equal to the lesser of (i) the aggregate capital account balance of the offending party and his or her permitted transferees in Silvercrest L.P. and (ii) the purchase price paid by the offending party to first acquire the Class B units, and, at our option, the required sale to us of all of the Class A common stock collectively held by the offending party and his or her permitted transferees at a purchase price equal to the purchase price paid by the offending party to first acquire the Class B units for which such shares of Class A common stock had been exchanged. Although we also would likely seek specific performance of these restrictive covenants, there can be no assurance that we would be successful in obtaining this relief. Further, after this post-employment restrictive period, we will not be able to prohibit a departed professional from soliciting our clients or employees. If any of our principals were to join a competitor or form a competing company, some of our current clients or other prominent members of the investing community could choose to invest with that competitor rather than us or otherwise withdraw assets from our company which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nCompetition for qualified investment, management and marketing and client service professionals is intense and we may fail to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel in the future.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified personnel will depend heavily on the amount and structure of compensation and opportunities for equity ownership we offer. Historically we have offered key employees equity ownership through interests in Silvercrest L.P. Those key employees who are currently limited partners of Silvercrest L.P. hold these interests in the form of Class B units. We expect our compensation structure to include a combination of cash and equity-based incentives as appropriate. Although we intend for overall compensation levels to remain commensurate with amounts paid to our key employees in the past, we may not be successful in designing and implementing an attractive compensation model. Any cost-reduction initiative or adjustments or reductions to compensation could negatively impact our ability to retain key personnel. In addition, changes to our management structure, corporate culture and corporate governance arrangements could negatively impact our ability to retain key personnel. If we are unable to retain key personnel, our results of operations may be negatively affected.\nRisks Related to our Structure\nThe rights of holders of Class B units of Silvercrest L.P. may give rise to conflicts of interest.\nAs a result of our principals holding all or a portion of their ownership interests in our business through Silvercrest L.P., rather than through Silvercrest, these existing owners may have other conflicting interests with holders of our Class A common stock. For example, our principals may have different tax positions from holders of our Class A common stock which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when we should dispose of assets, whether and when we should incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the tax receivable agreement that was entered into in connection with our initial public offering, and whether and when our company should terminate the tax receivable agreement and accelerate its obligations thereunder. Also, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration our principals\u2019 tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us.\nOur ability to pay regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our structure and applicable provisions of Delaware law.\nWe intend to declare cash dividends on our Class A common stock. However, our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. In addition, because of our structure, we will be dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to generate earnings and cash flows and distribute them to us so that we may pay dividends to our stockholders. We expect to cause Silvercrest L.P., which is a Delaware limited partnership, to make distributions to its partners, including us, in an amount sufficient for us to pay dividends. However, its ability to make such distributions will be subject to its subsidiaries\u2019 operating results, cash requirements and financial condition, the applicable provisions of Delaware law that may limit the amount of funds available for distribution to its partners, its compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to current and future indebtedness (including the credit facility entered into in June 2013 by the subsidiaries of Silvercrest L.P.), its other agreements with third parties, as well as its obligation to make tax distributions under the second amended and restated limited\npartnership agreement (which distributions would reduce the cash available for distributions by Silvercrest L.P. to us). As a Delaware corporation, our ability to pay cash dividends to our Class A common stockholders with the distributions received by us as general partner of Silvercrest L.P. also will be subject to the applicable provisions of Delaware law. Also, each of the companies in the corporate chain must manage its assets, liabilities and working capital in order to meet all of its cash obligations, including the payment of dividends or distributions. As a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our Class A common stock. Any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur ability to pay taxes and expenses, including payments under the tax receivable agreement, may be limited by our structure.\nWe have no material assets other than our ownership of Class A units of Silvercrest L.P. and have no independent means of generating revenue. Silvercrest L.P. is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income is allocated to holders of its partnership units, including us. Accordingly, we will incur income taxes on our proportionate share of any net taxable income of Silvercrest L.P. and also will incur expenses related to our operations. Under the terms of its second amended and restated limited partnership agreement, Silvercrest L.P. is obligated to make tax distributions to holders of its partnership units, including us. In addition to tax expenses, we also will incur expenses related to our operations, including expenses under the tax receivable agreement, which we expect will be significant. We intend to cause Silvercrest L.P. to make distributions in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay our taxes and operating expenses, including any payments due under the tax receivable agreement. However, its ability to make such distributions will be subject to various limitations and restrictions as set forth in the preceding risk factor. If, as a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, we do not have sufficient funds to pay tax or other liabilities to fund our operations, we may need to borrow funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. To the extent we are unable to make payments under the tax receivable agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest at LIBOR plus 300 basis points until paid.\nWe will be required to pay principals for certain tax benefits we may claim, and the amounts we may pay could be significant.\nThe corporate reorganization of Silvercrest L.P. resulted in favorable tax attributes for us. In addition, future exchanges of Class B units of Silvercrest L.P. held by our principals for shares of our Class A common stock are expected to produce additional favorable tax attributes for us. When we acquire Class B units from existing principals, both the existing basis and the anticipated basis adjustments are likely to increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions allocable to us from Silvercrest L.P. and therefore reduce the amount of income tax we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. This increase in tax basis also may decrease gain (or increase loss) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent the increased tax basis is allocated to those capital assets.\nThe tax receivable agreement, which we entered into with our principals, generally provides for the payment by us to each of them of 85% of the amount of the cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal and state income tax that we actually realize (or are deemed to realize in certain circumstances) in periods after our initial public offering as a result of (i) any step-up in tax basis in Silvercrest L.P.\u2019s assets resulting from (a) the purchases or exchanges of Class B units (along with the corresponding shares of our Class B common stock) for shares of our Class A common stock and (b) payments under this tax receivable agreement; (ii) certain prior distributions by Silvercrest L.P. and prior transfers or exchanges of Class B units which resulted in tax basis adjustments to the assets of Silvercrest L.P.; and (iii) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed to be paid by us as a result of this tax receivable agreement.\nWe expect that the payments we will be required to make under the tax receivable agreement will be substantial. Assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize all tax benefits that are subject to the tax receivable agreement, we expect that the reduction in tax payments for us associated with (i) the purchase of Class B units from certain of the limited partners of Silvercrest L.P. with a portion of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and (ii) exchanges of Class B units subsequent to our initial public offering as described above would aggregate approximately $10.8 million over a 15-year period. Under such scenario we would be required to pay the holders of Class B limited partnership units approximately $9.2 million, over a 15-year period. The actual amounts may materially differ from these hypothetical amounts, as potential future reductions in tax payments for us and tax receivable agreement payments by us will be calculated using the market value of our Class A common stock and the prevailing tax rates at the time of the exchange and will be dependent on us generating sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit.\nThe actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under this agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges by principals, the price of our Class A common stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future and the tax rate then applicable, as well as the portion of our payments under the tax receivable agreement constituting imputed interest or depreciable or amortizable basis. Payments under the tax receivable agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine. Although we are not aware of any issue that would cause the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, to challenge a tax basis\nincrease or other tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement, we will not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement. As a result, in certain circumstances, payments could be made under the tax receivable agreement in excess of the benefits that we actually realize in respect of the attributes to which the tax receivable agreement relates.\nIn certain cases, payments under the tax receivable agreement to our principals may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement.\nThe tax receivable agreement provides that upon certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control, or if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the tax receivable agreement, our (or our successor\u2019s) obligations under the tax receivable agreement (with respect to all Class B units held by our principals, whether or not such Class B units have been exchanged or acquired before or after such transaction) would be based on certain assumptions, including that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully avail ourselves of the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement. As a result, (i) we could be required to make payments under the tax receivable agreement that are greater than or less than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement, and (ii) if we elect to terminate the tax receivable agreement early, we would be required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization of such future benefits. In these situations, our obligations under the tax receivable agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the tax receivable agreement. If we were to elect to terminate the tax receivable agreement, we estimate that we would be required to pay approximately $9.2 million in the aggregate under the tax receivable agreement.\nIf we were deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act as a result of our ownership interest in Silvercrest L.P., applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe do not believe that we are an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act. Because we, as the sole general partner of Silvercrest L.P., control and operate Silvercrest L.P., we believe that our interest in Silvercrest L.P. is not an \u201cinvestment security\u201d as that term is used in the Investment Company Act. If we were to cease participation in the management of Silvercrest L.P., our interest in Silvercrest L.P. could be deemed an \u201cinvestment security\u201d for purposes of the Investment Company Act. A person may be an \u201cinvestment company\u201d if it owns investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items). Our sole asset is our general partner interest in Silvercrest L.P. A determination that such investment was an investment security could cause us to be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act and to become subject to the registration and other requirements of the Investment Company Act. In addition, we do not believe that we are an investment company under Section 3(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act because we are not primarily engaged in a business that causes us to fall within the definition of \u201cinvestment company.\u201d We and Silvercrest L.P. intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. However, if we were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe provide a broad range of services to the Silvercrest Funds and family office services, which may expose us to liability.\nWe provide a broad range of administrative services to the management of certain of our company\u2019s funds of funds and other investment funds (collectively, the \u201cSilvercrest Funds\u201d), including preparation or supervision of the preparation of some of the Silvercrest Funds\u2019 regulatory filings, provision of shareholder services and communications, accounting services including the supervision of the activities of Silvercrest Funds\u2019 accounting services providers in the calculation of the funds\u2019 net asset values, supervision of the preparation of Silvercrest Funds\u2019 financial statements and coordination of the audits of those financial statements, tax services, including supervision of tax return preparation and supervision of the work of Silvercrest Funds\u2019 other service providers. If it were determined that the Silvercrest Funds failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements as a result of action or failure to act by our employees, we could be responsible for losses suffered or penalties imposed.\nWe also provide a range of family office services to some of our clients, including philanthropic, estate and wealth planning services, tax planning and preparation, financial statement, bill paying and record keeping services, bank loan arrangement and payment services and property and casualty insurance review. If we fail to perform these services properly, we could incur costs and reputational harm for which we might be liable. Further, we could have penalties imposed on us, be required to pay fines or be subject to private litigation, any of which could decrease our future income, or negatively affect our current business or our future growth prospects.\nRisks Related to the Regulatory Environment in Which we Operate\nThe regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to continuous change, and regulatory developments designed to increase oversight may adversely affect our business.\nThe legislative and regulatory environment in which we operate has undergone significant changes in the recent past, including additional filings with the SEC and the CFTC required by investment advisors, which have resulted in increased costs to the Company. Significant regulatory changes in our industry may to continue, which would likely subject industry participants to additional, more costly and generally more detailed regulation. New laws or regulations, or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations, applicable to us and our clients may adversely affect our business. Our ability to function in this environment will depend on our ability to monitor and promptly react to legislative and regulatory changes. There have been a number of highly publicized regulatory inquiries that have focused on the investment management industry. These inquiries already have resulted in increased scrutiny of the industry and new rules and regulations for investment advisers. This regulatory scrutiny may limit our ability to engage in certain activities that might be beneficial to our stockholders.\nIn addition, acts of serious fraud in the investment management industry and perceived lapses in regulatory oversight, U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and regulatory authorities may increase regulatory oversight of our businesses. We may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the SEC, the CFTC, other U.S. or non-U.S. governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets. We also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations, as well as by U.S. and non-U.S. courts. It is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed on us or the markets in which we trade, or whether any of the proposals will become law. Compliance with any new laws or regulations could add to our compliance burden and costs and affect the manner in which we conduct business.\nFailure to comply with \u201cpay to play\u201d regulations implemented by the SEC and certain states, and changes to the \u201cpay to play\u201d regulatory regimes, could adversely affect our business.\nThe SEC and several states have initiated investigations alleging that certain private equity firms and hedge funds or agents acting on their behalf have paid money to current or former government officials or their associates in exchange for improperly soliciting contracts with state pension funds. The SEC has also recently initiated a similar investigation into contracts awarded by sovereign wealth funds. The SEC approved Rule 206(4)-5 under the Advisers Act regarding \u201cpay to play\u201d practices by investment advisers involving campaign contributions and other payments to government officials able to exert influence on potential government entity clients. Among other restrictions, the rule prohibits investment advisers from providing advisory services for compensation to a government entity for two years, subject to very limited exceptions, after the investment adviser, its senior executives or its personnel involved in soliciting investments from government entities have made contributions to certain candidates and officials in a position to influence the hiring of an investment adviser by such government entity. Advisers are required to implement compliance policies designed, among other matters, to track contributions by certain of the adviser\u2019s employees and engagements of third parties that solicit government entities (and political action committees controlled by such persons) and to keep certain records in order to enable the SEC to determine compliance with the rule. Additionally, California enacted legislation that requires placement agents (including in certain cases employees of investment managers) who solicit funds from California state retirement systems, such as the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, to register as lobbyists, thereby becoming subject to increased reporting requirements and prohibited from receiving contingent compensation for soliciting investments from California state retirement systems. There also has been similar rulemaking in New York and other states. Such additional regulations may require the attention of senior management and may result in fines if any of our funds are deemed to have violated any regulations, thereby imposing additional expenses on us. Any failure on our part to comply with these rules could cause us to lose compensation for our advisory services or expose us to significant penalties and reputational damage.\nWe could be subject to regulatory investigations, which could harm our reputation and cause our funds to lose existing investors or us to lose existing accounts or fail to attract new investors or accounts.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, suspensions of individual employees or other sanctions. Even if an investigation or proceeding did not result in a fine or sanction or the fine or sanction imposed against us or our employees by a regulator were small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to an investigation, proceeding or imposition of these fines or sanctions could harm our reputation and cause our funds to lose existing investors or us to lose existing accounts or fail to attract new investors or accounts.\nRisk Related Generally to our Business\nOur failure to comply with investment guidelines set by our clients and limitations imposed by applicable law could result in damage awards against us and a loss of our assets under management, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nCertain clients who retain us to manage assets on their behalf specify guidelines regarding investment allocation and strategy that we are required to follow in managing their portfolios. In addition, the boards of mutual funds we sub-advise generally establish similar guidelines regarding the investment of assets in those funds. We are also required to invest the mutual funds\u2019 assets in accordance with limitations under the Investment Company Act, and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Our failure to comply with any of these guidelines and other limitations could result in losses to clients which, depending on the circumstances, could result in our obligation to make clients whole for such losses. If we believed that the circumstances did not justify a reimbursement, or clients believed the reimbursement we offered was insufficient, they could seek to recover damages from us, withdraw assets from our management or terminate their investment advisory agreement with us. Any of these events could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOperational risks, including the threat of cyber-attacks, may disrupt our business, breach our clients\u2019 security, result in losses or limit our growth.\nWe are heavily dependent on the capacity and reliability of the communications, information and technology systems supporting our operations, whether developed, owned and operated by us or by third parties. Operational risks, such as trading or operational errors or interruption of our financial, accounting, trading, compliance and other data processing systems, whether caused by the failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches, or other cyber security threats or attacks, including breaches of our vendors\u2019 technology and systems, fire or other natural disaster, power or telecommunications failure, act of terrorism or war or otherwise, could result in a disruption of our business, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage, and thus have a material adverse effect on our business. Some types of operational risks, including, for example, trading errors, may be increased in periods of increased volatility, which can magnify the cost of an error. Cyber security risks relating to our business primarily involve the potential security breaches of our clients\u2019 personal and financial information and illegal use thereof through system-wide \u201chacking\u201d or other means. While we have never had any cyber security threat or attack on our technology systems, this may occur in the future.\nAlthough we have back-up systems and cyber security and consumer protection measures in place, our back-up procedures, cyber defenses and capabilities in the event of a failure, interruption, or breach of security may not be adequate. Insurance and other safeguards we use may not be available or may only partially reimburse us for our losses related to operational failures or cyber-attacks. In addition, we may choose to reimburse a client in the event of a trading error or under other circumstances, even if we are not legally required to do so, and any such reimbursements could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs a public company and as our client base, number of investment strategies and/or physical locations increase, developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure and protecting our systems from cyber security attacks and threats may become increasingly challenging and costly, which could constrain our ability to expand our businesses. Any upgrades or expansions to our operations and/or technology to accommodate increased volumes of transactions or otherwise may require significant expenditures and may increase the probability that we will suffer system interruptions and failures. We also depend substantially on our New York office where a majority of our employees, administration and technology resources are located, for the continued operation of our business. Any significant disruption to that office could have a material adverse effect on us.\nImproper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\nWe and our service providers store and process personal client information. It is possible that the security controls, training and other processes with respect to personal data may not prevent the improper disclosure of client information. Such disclosure could harm our reputation as well and subject us to liability, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.\nEmployee misconduct could expose us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.\nWe are vulnerable to reputational harm because we operate in an industry in which personal relationships, integrity and the confidence of our clients are of critical importance. Our employees may engage in misconduct that could subject us to regulatory sanctions and to suffer serious reputational harm (as a consequence of the negative perception resulting from such activities), which could adversely affect our financial position, client relationships and ability to attract new clients.\nOur business often requires that we deal with confidential information. If our employees were to improperly use or disclose this information, even if inadvertently, we could be subject to legal action and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not always be effective. In addition, the SEC has increased its scrutiny of the use of non-public information obtained from corporate insiders by professional investors. Misconduct by our employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in an adverse effect on our reputation and our business.\nFailure to properly address conflicts of interest could harm our reputation, business and results of operations.\nAs we expand the scope of our business and our client base, we must continue to monitor and address any conflicts between our interests and those of our clients. The SEC and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest, and we have implemented procedures and controls that we believe are reasonably designed to address these issues. However, appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex, and if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest, we could face reputational damage, litigation or regulatory proceedings or penalties, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe investment management industry faces substantial litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us.\nWe depend on our network of relationships and on our reputation in order to attract and retain client assets. Our investment decisions could result in substantial losses to our clients. If our clients suffer significant losses or are otherwise dissatisfied with our services, we could be subject to legal liabilities or actions alleging negligent misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, unjust enrichment and/or fraud. These risks are often difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time, even after an action has been commenced. We may incur significant legal expenses in defending against litigation commenced by a client or regulatory authority. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us.\nThe investment management industry is intensely competitive.\nThe investment management industry is intensely competitive, and our ability to compete effectively could materially impact our results of operations. Competitiveness is based on various factors, including investment performance, investment management fee rates, continuity of investment professionals and client relationships, the quality of services provided to clients, reputation, continuity of selling arrangements with intermediaries and differentiated products. Several additional factors, including the following, increase our competitive risks:\n\u2022a number of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, name recognition and other resources and more personnel than we do;\n\u2022potential competitors have a relatively low cost of entering the investment management industry;\n\u2022the recent trend toward consolidation in the investment management industry and the securities business in general, has served to increase the size and strength of a number of our competitors;\n\u2022some investors may prefer to invest with a non-publicly traded investment manager due to the perception that a publicly traded asset manager may prioritize the manager\u2019s own growth to the detriment of client investment performance;\n\u2022some competitors may have different investment styles or invest in alternative asset classes that the markets may perceive as more attractive than our investment strategies;\n\u2022other industry participants, hedge funds and alternative asset managers may seek to recruit our investment professionals; and\n\u2022some competitors charge lower fees for their investment services than we do.\nReductions in business sourced through third-party distribution channels, or their poor reviews of us or our products, could materially reduce our revenue and ability to attract new clients.\nAccounts sourced through consultant-led searches have been key to our future growth. We also have accessed the high-net-worth segment of the investing community through relationships with well-respected wealth advisers who use our investment strategies in investment programs they construct for their clients. As of December 31, 2021 we had approximately $5.1 billion in assets under management from third party distribution channels, which constituted approximately 16% of our total assets under management. Our failure to successfully maintain these third-party distribution channels could materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, poor reviews or evaluations by any of these parties, whether of a particular product or of us, could result in client withdrawals and impact our ability to attract new assets through such intermediaries.\nA change of control could result in termination of our sub-investment advisory and investment advisory agreements.\nPursuant to the Advisers Act, each of our investment advisory agreements for the separate accounts we manage may not be assigned without the consent of the client. In addition, under the Investment Company Act, each of the investment advisory agreements with SEC registered mutual funds that we sub-advise automatically terminates in the event of its assignment. A sale of a controlling block of our voting securities and certain other transactions would be deemed an \u201cassignment\u201d pursuant to the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act. Such an assignment may be deemed to occur in the event that the holders of the Class B units of Silvercrest L.P. exchange enough of their Class B units for shares of our Class A common stock and dispose of such shares of Class A common stock such that they no longer own a controlling interest in us, even if no other person or group acquires a controlling interest. If such a deemed assignment occurs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary consents from our clients and, unless the necessary approvals and consents are obtained, the deemed assignment could adversely affect our ability to continue managing client accounts, resulting in the loss of assets under management and a corresponding loss of revenue.\nIf our techniques for managing risk are ineffective, we may be exposed to material unanticipated losses.\nIn order to manage the significant risks inherent in our business, we must maintain effective policies, procedures and systems that enable us to identify, monitor and control our exposure to operational, legal and reputational risks. Our risk management methods may prove to be ineffective due to their design, implementation or insufficient scope, or as a result of the lack of adequate, accurate or timely information or otherwise. If our risk management efforts are ineffective, we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results. Additionally, we could be subject to litigation, particularly from our clients, and sanctions or fines from regulators or self-regulatory organizations. Our techniques for managing risks in client portfolios may not fully mitigate the risk exposure in all economic or market environments, or against all types of risk, including risks that we might fail to identify or anticipate.\nOur reliance on prime brokers, custodians, administrators and other agents subjects us to certain risks relating to their execution of transactions and their solvency, and the failure by or insolvency of, any such person could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nOur business generally depends on the services of prime brokers, custodians, administrators and other agents to carry out securities transactions. For example, in the event of the insolvency of a prime broker and/or custodian, our funds might not be able to recover equivalent assets in full as they will rank among the prime broker\u2019s and custodian\u2019s unsecured creditors in relation to assets, which the prime broker or a custodian borrows, lends or otherwise uses. In addition, our funds\u2019 cash held with a prime broker or a custodian will not be segregated from the prime broker\u2019s or custodian\u2019s own cash, and our funds will therefore rank as unsecured creditors in relation thereto.\nIf we incur indebtedness or issue senior equity securities, we will be exposed to additional risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.\nThe amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our board of directors\u2019 assessment of market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. We may also use leverage to make certain investments. There is no assurance that a leveraging strategy will be successful. Leverage involves risks and special considerations that include the following:\n\u2022there is a likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value of our business and market price of our common stock than a comparable business without leverage;\n\u2022we will be exposed to increased risk of loss if we incur debt or issue senior equity securities to finance acquisitions or investments because a decrease in the value of our investments would have a greater negative impact on our returns, and therefore the value of our Class A common stock than if we did not use leverage;\n\u2022it is likely that such debt or equity securities will be governed by instruments containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. These covenants may impose asset overage or investment composition requirements that are more stringent than those of our business plan and could require our business to liquidate investments at an inopportune time;\n\u2022if we are required to pledge a substantial portion of our assets in order to obtain debt financing, it may limit our ability to enter into subsequent financings at attractive terms;\n\u2022we, and indirectly our investors, will bear the cost of leverage, including issuance and servicing costs; and\n\u2022any preferred, convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock.\nIn addition, the credit facility entered into in June 2013, as explained below, by all of the subsidiaries of Silvercrest L.P. and guaranteed by Silvercrest L.P. contains financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on distributions, incurrence of additional indebtedness, mergers and certain other dispositions of our business and sale of assets.\nAny requirement that we sell assets at a loss to redeem or pay interest on any leverage or for other reasons would reduce our equity value and also make it difficult for our net asset value to recover. Our board of directors, in its best judgment, nevertheless may determine to use leverage if it expects that the benefits to our common stockholders of maintaining the leveraged position will outweigh the risks. General interest rate fluctuations may have a substantial negative impact on our investments and investment opportunities. In addition, an increase in interest rates would make it more expensive for us to use debt to finance these investments.\nThe interest rates under our credit agreement may be impacted by the phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d).\nLIBOR is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rates on loans globally. We use LIBOR as a reference rate to calculate interest under certain borrowings under our credit facility. In 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the preferred alternative reference rate to U.S. dollar LIBOR and recommended a paced transition plan that involves the creation of a reference rate based on SOFR by the end of 2021. SOFR is a more generic measure than LIBOR and considers the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. Given the inherent differences between LIBOR and SOFR or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established, there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from LIBOR. Our credit facility contains a fallback provision providing for alternative rate calculations in the event LIBOR is unavailable, prior to any LIBOR rate transition. As a result, our level of interest payments we incur may change and the new rates we incur may not be as favorable to us as those in effect prior to any LIBOR phase-out.\nFuture financings could adversely affect us and our common stockholders by diluting existing stockholders or by placing restrictions on our ability to run our business, including making distributions to unitholders.\nThe subsidiaries of Silvercrest L.P. entered into a credit facility in June 2013, which was amended in July 2019, pursuant to which the subsidiaries of Silvercrest L.P. will be able to borrow up to $25.5 million in principal amount from time to time for working capital needs and other purposes. Although we believe that available borrowings under our credit facility and future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for normal operations pursuant to our business plan, these sources of capital may not fully fund our growth strategy in the immediate future. If we decide to pursue future acquisitions, we may draw down proceeds from our existing credit facilities and then raise additional capital through the incurrence of long-term or short-term indebtedness or the issuance of additional equity securities in private or public transactions. This could result in dilution of existing common stockholders\u2019 equity positions, increased interest expense and decreased net income. In addition, significant capital requirements associated with such investments may impair our ability to make distributions to our Class A common stockholders.\nNewly enacted laws or regulations and future changes in the taxation of businesses may impact our effective tax rate or may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nNewly enacted laws or regulations, and future changes in the taxation of businesses, may impact our effective tax rate or may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21%, further limited the deductibility of business interest expense, and restricted the use of net operating loss carryforwards arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2018. We cannot predict how changes in the laws or regulations, other guidance issued pursuant to such changes, or conforming or non-conforming state tax rules might affect us or our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that tax laws, including the U.S. corporate income tax rate, would not undergo significant changes in the near future.\nThe market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. Moreover, the trading volume of our Class A common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our Class A common stock declines significantly, you may be unable to sell your shares of Class A common stock at or above the price at which you purchased it, if at all. The market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our Class A common stock, or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our Class A common stock, include:\n\u2022variations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022failure to meet the market\u2019s earnings expectations;\n\u2022publication of research reports about us or the investment management industry, or the failure of securities analysts to continue to cover our Class A common stock;\n\u2022the public\u2019s reactions to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022departures of any of our portfolio managers or members of our senior management team or additions or departures of other key personnel;\n\u2022adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;\n\u2022market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategies;\n\u2022actions by stockholders;\n\u2022strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022changes in our capital structure;\n\u2022actual or anticipated poor performance in one or more of the investment strategies we offer;\n\u2022changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations, or differing interpretations thereof, affecting our business, or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022adverse publicity about the investment management industry generally or as a result of specific events;\n\u2022sales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or members of our management team;\n\u2022litigation and governmental investigations;\n\u2022the expiration of contractual lockup agreements; and\n\u2022changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war, and responses to such.\nFuture issuances and sales of our Class A common stock in the public market could lower our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock available for sale, or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling equity securities in the future, at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nWe have 9,869,101 shares of our Class A common stock outstanding as of February 25, 2022. The shares of Class A common stock that will be issuable upon exchange of Class B units held by our principals may only be sold in the manner and at the times described in our exchange agreement with our principals. For so long as a principal remains employed by us, during any 12-month period, each principal and his permitted transferees (e.g., family trusts) may collectively exchange vested Class B units that equal 20% of the Class B units such persons collectively held at the beginning of such 12-month period, subject to certain exceptions described under the second amended and restated limited partnership agreement of Silvercrest L.P. Upon a termination of employment other than due to retirement or for cause, all Class B units held by a principal, other than those Class B units forfeited under certain circumstances, will be exchanged automatically for shares of Class A common stock. The shares of Class A common stock received upon exchange for Class B units held by our principals may be sold (i) at any time and in any manner by retired employees and employees or estates of employees terminated due to death or disability, (ii) for any principal whose employment is terminated by us without cause, in an amount equal to 50% of the total shares of Class A common stock held by the principal at the time of termination of employment less any amounts sold for taxes in each 12-month period following the 18-month anniversary of the date of termination of employment, and (iii) for any principal who voluntarily resigns his employment, in an amount equal to one-third of the total shares of Class A common stock held by the principal at the time of termination of employment less any amounts sold for taxes in each 12-month period following the 18-month anniversary of the date of resignation of employment subject to manner of sale restrictions. The estate of our former Chief Executive Officer may sell portions or all of its Class A common shares in Silvercrest in order to diversify its portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have reserved for issuance 192,689 shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to, upon the exercise of options or other equity awards granted under, or upon exchange of Class B units granted under, our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan. We may increase the number of shares registered for this purpose from time to time. Once we register these additional shares, they will be able to be sold in the public market upon issuance.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A common stock may have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nStockholders may experience dilution in the future.\nStockholders will experience further dilution upon issuance of restricted Class B units or restricted shares of our Class A common stock, or upon the grant of options or equity awards to purchase Class B units or shares of our Class A common stock, in each case under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management, which could make it difficult to manage our business, particularly since we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with various regulatory and reporting requirements, including those required by the SEC. Complying with these reporting and other regulatory requirements is time-consuming and results in increased costs to us and could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and requirements of Sarbanes Oxley. These requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. Sarbanes Oxley requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, we need to commit significant resources, hire additional staff and provide additional management oversight. We have implemented additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. Sustaining our growth also will require us to commit additional management, operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join our company and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support our expansion. In addition, as a public company, we have enhanced our investor relations, legal and corporate communications functions. All of these activities and additional efforts may increase our costs, strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFor so long as we remained an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we were able to take advantage of certain temporary exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes Oxley (and rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, which we refer to as Section 404) and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation . Since we are no longer an emerging growth company, we expect to incur additional expenses and devote increased management effort toward ensuring compliance with those requirements applicable to companies that are not emerging growth companies. Even though we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we currently do, and may continue to, qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d which allows us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements. However, we cannot be certain we will continue to so qualify or predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on our revenue levels, which we expect to continue into 2022.\nOur revenue is highly correlated to securities markets, and we expect that our assets under management and revenue levels will be negatively impacted, on an incremental basis, by the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on securities markets. While the COVID-19 pandemic did not materially affect the Company\u2019s financial results and business operations in the Company\u2019s first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2020, economic and health conditions in the United States and across most of the globe have changed rapidly since the end of the first quarter, which has led to increased volatility and uncertainty in securities markets in the United States and across the globe. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic affected our operations in the second quarter ended June 30, 2020 through the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021, and may continue to do so indefinitely thereafter. While demand for the Company\u2019s services continues given the current capital markets and overall economic environment, such demand may not continue and demand may decrease from historical levels depending on the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the length of time it takes for normal economic and operating conditions to resume, additional governmental actions that may be taken and/or extensions of time for restrictions that have been imposed to date, and numerous other uncertainties. Such events may result in business disruption, reduced earnings and operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe transmission of COVID-19 and efforts to contain its spread have resulted in border closings and other travel restrictions and significant disruptions to business operations, supply chains and customer activity, including event cancellations and restrictions, service cancellations and wide-spread quarantines. These impacts and the uncertainty around the future impact of COVID-19, including the extent and duration of the impact on economies around the world, have caused significant volatility and declines in the global financial markets, which are expected to continue to result in business disruptions, reduced earnings and operations, which could materially affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nThe Company cannot predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its clients, vendors, and other business partners.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the Company\u2019s clients, vendors, and other business partners, but the Company is not able to assess the full extent of the current impact nor predict the ultimate consequences that will result therefrom. We are working to obtain information about and maintain communications with our clients, vendors and business partners to coordinate efforts related to business continuity which may mitigate some, but not all, of the adverse effects resulting from the pandemic. If the Company\u2019s clients, vendors and business partners are impacted by the pandemic for an extended period of time, the Company\u2019s earnings and operations may be negatively impacted as well.", "PERMNO": 13969, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "SAMG"}
