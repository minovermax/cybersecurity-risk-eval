Risk Factors.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. The following summary identifies certain material risks and uncertainties facing our business, many of which are beyond our control. A more complete discussion of each these and other risks and uncertainties is set forth under \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this 2021 Form 10-K, the occurrence of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our actual results.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOperate in a rapidly evolving industry\nCompetition with other digital marketing and advertising companies\nUnfavorable publicity and perception of our industry\nFluctuation and seasonality of our clients\u2019 needs\nRisks Related to Our Publishers\nCompetition buying media\nNeed to connect with users in specific media channels\nImpact of unauthorized or unlawful acts by third-party publishers or vendors\nLimitations on our ability to collect user data\nRisks Related to Our Owned Media Properties\nNeed to evolve our products and services to meet client and user needs and changing technologies\nNeed to connect with users through mobile apps\nDetection of click-through and/or other fraud\nRewards fulfillment costs\nCredit risk and payment disputes with our clients\nOther Business Risks\nGrowth of operations, effective management and ability to scale\nIncreased challenges of international operations\nImpact of acquisitions on operations\nUnfavorable global economic conditions\nDependence on key personnel\nAbility to attract and retain employees\nDependence on third-party service providers\nRisks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nImpact of governmental laws and regulations\nLaws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and personal information\nEnvironmental, employment, social and governance matters\nLitigation, inquiries, investigations, examinations or other legal proceedings\nSales and use and other taxes\nRisks Relating to Data Security and Intellectual Property\nNeed to safeguard personal information and other data\nNeed to protect our intellectual property rights\nThird party claims from creation and use of digital media content\nRisks Related to Financial Matters\nRestrictions on operations from covenants in Credit Agreement\nNeed for additional capital\nEarnings charges from impairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and the Securities Markets\nFluctuations in stock price\nConcentration of stock ownership\nDilution from future share issuances from acquisitions or stock incentive plans\nNo cash dividends for foreseeable future.\nStatus as a \"smaller reporting company\"\nRisk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe operate in an industry that is rapidly evolving, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from digital marketing services, which is an industry that has undergone rapid and significant changes in its relatively short history, and which is characterized by rapidly changing internet media and advertising technology, evolving industry standards, regulatory uncertainty, and changing user and client demands. Our future success depends on our ability to effectively respond to the rapidly changing needs of our clients, respond to competitive technological developments and industry changes and cost effectively acquire media from our publishers. As a result of this continual evolution, we face risks and uncertainties such as:\n\u2022\nthe rapidly evolving industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in the economic condition, market dynamics, regulatory enforcement or legislative environment affecting our, our third-party publishers\u2019, and our clients\u2019 businesses;\n\u2022\nour dependence on the availability and affordability of quality media from third-party publishers;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage cybersecurity risks and costs associated with maintaining a robust security infrastructure;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain and expand existing client relationships;\n\u2022 our ability to maintain user interaction with our owned-and-operated websites on mobile devices; and\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with and avoid regulatory scrutiny in a rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment.\nIf we are unable to address these risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to compete effectively against other digital marketing and traditional advertising alternatives or fail to meet performance metrics required by our clients, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nThe market for digital marketing is intensely competitive, and we expect this competition to continue and to increase in the future, both from existing and new competitors. We compete for advertiser clients against other digital marketing companies on the basis of a number of factors, including return on adverstising spend (\"ROAS\") of client\u2019s marketing spending, price and client service. We also compete for our clients\u2019 overall marketing and\nadvertising\nbudgets with online and traditional media companies. When our clients experience a reduction in their advertising budgets, newer media sources such as those we offer can often be the first expenditures to be cut. Our advertiser clients have expectations as to the ROAS of their media spend, as well as the quality and conversion rates of the leads that we generate, and they choose to do business with us based on their ROAS and the quality and convertibility of the leads we generate. The expectations of our clients may change over time, and the ROAS or leads that we supply to our clients may not always meet these expectations. Conversion rates for leads can be impacted by factors other than the lead quality, many of which are outside our control, such as the competition in our clients\u2019 industries and our clients\u2019 sales practices. Lower conversion rates could be even more likely as we expand our services and relationships with our clients by moving our conversion point further \u201cdown the funnel,\u201d closer to where our clients are able to monetize the leads we provide. Our clients may curtail their advertising spend with us or stop using our services altogether if we fail to meet their expectations in terms of their ROAS or the quality and convertibility of leads or otherwise fail to compete effectively against other online marketing and advertising companies.\nOur top ten advertisers accounted for approximately 35% of our revenue in 2021 with one advertiser accounting for more approximately 11.7% of our consolidated revenue. The loss of one or more of our major clients could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfavorable publicity and negative public perception about our industry may damage our reputation, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWith the growth of online advertising and e-commerce, there is increasing awareness and concern among the general public, privacy advocates, mainstream media, governmental bodies and others regarding online marketing, advertising, telecommunications and privacy matters, particularly as they relate to individual privacy interests. Certain other companies within our industry may engage in activities that others may view as unlawful or inappropriate. These activities by third parties, including our competitors, or even companies in other data-focused industries, may be seen as indicative of the behavior of our industry as a whole, which may thereby harm the reputation of all participants in our industry, including us. Additionally, as a large player in our niche of the industry, smaller competitors frequently design their websites to look like they are owned and operated by us. If these competitors engage in non-compliant activities, it can have a particularly damaging impact on our relationships with our users and/or clients.\nMoreover, any such unfavorable publicity or negative public perception could lead to digital publishers, platforms and app stores such as those operated by Facebook, Google and Apple, changing their business practices or attracting additional regulatory scrutiny or lawmaking, which could adversely affect us or our industry. Heightened scrutiny on the part of the public or regulators may lead to general distrust of our industry, consumer reluctance to share and permit use of personal data and increased consumer opt-out rates, any of which could negatively influence, change or reduce our current and prospective clients\u2019 demand for our products and services and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on attracting a large number of visitors to our websites and providing inquiries, clicks, calls, text messages, application installations and customers to our clients, which depends in part on our reputation within the industry, with our clients and with our users. Our ability to attract potential users and, thereby, clients, also depends in part on users earning incentives and receiving job listings, prizes, samples and other content, as well as accessing attractive offers from our advertiser clients. If our users are not satisfied with the content of our websites, the incentives or opportunities offered or our clients\u2019 offerings, our reputation and therefore our ability to attract additional users and clients could be harmed.\nIn addition, from time to time, we have been and may in the future be subject to investigations, inquiries or litigation by various regulators and claimants, which may harm our reputation, regardless of the outcome of any such action. Any damage to our reputation, including from publicity from legal proceedings against us or companies that work within our industry, governmental proceedings, class action litigation, or the disclosure of information security breaches or private information misuse, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations\nWe do not have long term agreements with our clients. Clients' needs are subject to seasonality and may fluctuate significantly from period to period which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nBecause the majority of our contracts with our advertiser clients do not have fixed commitments, these clients have the ability to unilaterally terminate their agreements with us, pause their campaigns, or materially reduce the amount of business they conduct with us at any time, with little or no prior notice. There is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements with any of our clients on acceptable terms, or at all. Moreover, some of our advertiser clients seek specific sub-sets of consumers and, despite the return they are able to achieve on the leads we provide, may determine not to renew their agreements with us because we are unable to provide significant additional user profiles that meet their criteria.\nAdditionally, because of the nature of our performance-based agreements, we typically bear the costs of purchasing media without the assurance of advertising spend by any particular advertiser client. We must be able to generate more revenue from our users than our cost to acquire such users in order to be profitable. Our ability to do so is dependent on many factors, including having the right media sources to drive users who engage with our sites, providing content and experiences that retain users' attention and displaying relevant advertisements and other content to users. Other factors, some of which are outside of our control, such as competition, changing consumer tastes and general economic conditions, may inhibit our ability to operate our business profitably, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur results are also subject to fluctuation as a result of seasonality and cyclicality in our and our clients\u2019 businesses. Some of our clients have lower advertising budgets during our first fiscal quarter ending March 31. The costs to acquire media from our publishers is also subject to seasonal variability with media cost typically increasing in the fourth quarter. Our results of operations have in the past been adversely affected when we were unable to respond to the fluctuations in the price and availability of media, and similar effects may occur in the future.\nCertain clients have budgets that start stronger at the beginning of quarterly or monthly periods, may reach limits during such periods, but then may have needs to satisfy their performance objectives at the end of such periods. Beyond these budgetary constraints and buying patterns of clients, other factors affecting our business may include macroeconomic conditions affecting the digital media industry and the various market verticals we serve. Poor macroeconomic conditions could decrease our clients\u2019 advertising spending and, thereby, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Publishers\nWe attract a substantial majority of visitors to our websites through media purchases from third-party publishers, social media platforms and internet search providers. There is substantial competition for this web traffic, and any decline in the supply of media available through these third parties or increase in the price of this media could increase the cost to attract visitors to our websites and reduce our profitability.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract users to our websites and generate revenues from their activities thereon in a cost-effective manner. A substantial majority of our revenue is attributable to visitor traffic originating from third-party publishers, including ad networks, social media platforms and search engines. Our ability to maintain the number of users who come to our and our third-party publishers\u2019 websites is not entirely within our control. Third-party publishers can change the media inventory they make available to us at any time, change the pricing of such media and/or place significant restrictions on our content offerings. Many of these publishers have their own guidelines on acceptable content, advertisements and the types of advertisers and websites that can advertise on their properties. These guidelines change frequently and can often be unpublished. If a third-party publisher decides not to make media inventory available to us, decides to demand higher pricing or a higher revenue share, or places significant restrictions on the use of such inventory, we may not be able to find media inventory from other websites that satisfy our requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nMoreover, there is substantial competition for web traffic among both established media buyers and smaller operators, and we expect this competition to continue to increase, given the limited barriers to entry into the market. While we saw a substantial increase in the number of user registrations on our websites at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a substantial decline in the number of user registrations over the second half of 2020 and levels remained depressed during 2021. This decline was attributable, in part, to increased competition for web traffic and higher cost of media. However, the primary driver of this decline was our Traffic Quality Initiative (\u201cTQI\u201d), through which we substantially curtailed the volume of lower quality affiliate traffic that we source beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nTo replace lower quality affiliate traffic, we have shifted our media spend to other sources, suppliers, channels and media strategies that meet our quality requirements, including social media platforms. If we are unable to cost-effectively source enough media traffic that meets our quality standards, we may not be able to increase our registration volume back to levels prior to the TQI.\nAdditionally, if we expand the scope of our services, we may compete with a greater number of websites, clients and traditional media companies across an increasing range of different media, including in vertical markets where competitors may have advantages in expertise, brand recognition and other areas. Major internet search engine operators, such as Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft, as well as social media platforms, such as Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok, have significant numbers of direct sales personnel and substantial proprietary advertising inventory and web traffic that provide them significant competitive advantages. Past and possible future consolidation of online advertising networks has led to and could lead to further concentration of desirable inventory on websites or networks owned by a small number of persons or entities, which could affect pricing and availability of media inventory and web traffic available to us. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors enjoy other competitive advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, larger client bases, greater access to media inventory on high-traffic websites, and greater financial, technical and marketing resources. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against these competitors in order to acquire media inventory that meets our performance, price and quality requirements. If we are not able to do so, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business could be harmed if we or our third-party publishers are unable to contact users through specific channels.\nWe and our third-party publishers use email, text messages, push notifications, telephone calls and social media, among other channels, to reach users for marketing purposes. The laws, rules and regulations governing such usage continue to evolve, and changes in technology, the marketplace, or consumer preferences may lead to the adoption of or changes in laws, rules or regulations. If new laws, rules or regulations are adopted or existing laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced to impose additional restrictions on our ability to use email, text messages, push notifications or social media to contact users, or engage in telemarketing, we and our third-party publishers may not be able to communicate with users in a cost-effective manner.\nAdditionally, if email service providers (\u201cESPs\u201d) or internet service providers (\"ISPs\") implement new or more restrictive email or content delivery or accessibility policies, it may become more difficult to deliver emails to consumers or for consumers to access our websites and services. For example, certain ESPs including Google, may categorize our emails as \u201cpromotional,\u201d and these emails may be directed to an alternate, and less readily accessible, section of a consumer\u2019s inbox. If ESPs materially limit or halt the delivery of emails advertising our websites, or if we fail to deliver emails to users in a manner compatible with email providers\u2019 handling or authentication technologies, our ability to contact users through email could be significantly restricted. In addition, if we are placed on \u201cspam\u201d lists or lists of entities that have been involved in sending unwanted, unsolicited emails, our operating results and financial condition could be substantially harmed. Further, if ISPs prioritize or provide superior access to our competitors\u2019 content, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nSimilarly, telephone carriers may block or put consumer warnings on calls originating from call centers or block or limit text messages from marketers. With a heightened aversion to robocalling, consumers increasingly screen their incoming telephone calls and emails, including by using such tools and warnings, and therefore it is possible that users may not reliably receive our emails or telephone messages. If we are unable to contact users effectively by email or telephone as a result of legislation, blockage, screening technologies or otherwise, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nIn addition, as we expand our usage of text messaging and push notifications to contact users, we become more dependent on third-party providers that control the dissemination and deliverability of such communications. These third-party providers and the wireless carriers may block text messages or shut down our text message service providers' ability to send text messages. These third parties may include mobile operating systems, ISPs, wireless carriers, aggregators and internet browsers, each of which may have its own guidelines on acceptable content. Recently, wireless carriers have been requiring service providers who use long codes - ten digit telephone numbers - to register under the 10dlc registration requirements. If our service providers are unable to register the long codes they use to send text messages for us under the 10dlc registration requirements, our ability to send text messages to re-engage with our mobile users or on behalf of our third party advertisers could be adversely affected causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.\nThird-party publishers or vendors may engage in unauthorized or unlawful acts that could subject us to significant liability, cause us to lose advertisers and other clients or damage our reputation.\nWe generate a significant portion of our web visitors from online media that we purchase from third-party publishers. While we actively monitor our publishers\u2019 activities and have adopted more stringent publisher requirements and instituted periodic review of advertising creatives for our largest publishers, we cannot police all such behavior. Any activity by third-party publishers that our advertisers and other clients view as potentially damaging to their brands or reputation, even if prohibited by our contracts with our clients, could harm our relationships with our advertisers or other clients, in which instance they may refuse to pay or terminate their relationships with us, resulting in a loss of revenue. Additionally, when we cease working with third-party publishers who engage in inappropriate practices, we may be unable to quickly find alternative supply at acceptable quality and prices.\nWe may also face liability for any failure of our third-party publishers or vendors to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Users or clients may complain about the content of publisher ads or the methods by which ads are delivered by third-party publishers, which may expose us to lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny or cause advertisers to withhold payment to us. Publishers may use unapproved marketing channels, such as text messaging, to drive users to our sites, which may expose us to liability under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\") and other laws regulating telemarketing and text messaging. Despite our efforts to monitor and deter unauthorized or unlawful actions by these third-party publishers, and to contractually limit our liability in such instances, it is possible that we could be held responsible for this behavior. As a result, we could experience significant reputational harm and/or become subject to costly litigation, which, if we are unsuccessful in defending, could lead us to incur damages for the unauthorized or unlawful acts of third-party publishers or vendors.\nLimitations on our or our third-party publishers\u2019 ability to collect and use data derived from user activities, as well as new technologies that eliminate cookies, block our or our third-party publishers\u2019 ability to deliver internet-based advertising, could both increase the cost of media and significantly diminish the value of our services, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWhen a user visits our websites, we use technologies to collect information including self-declared use registration data and user responses to our dynamically populated survey questions to create robust user profiles, which we use in our targeted ad serving, lead generation and consumer data offerings. We also use technologies to track user interactions with our advertiser offers in order to track conversions and our users\u2019 progress to earning rewards. The use of personal information which includes transactional data, is subject to evolving laws and regulations, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and industry self-regulatory activities.\nTechnologies, tools, software and applications (including new and enhanced web browsers) have been developed, and are likely to continue to be developed, that can block or allow users to opt-out of display, search and internet-based advertising and content and ad tracking, or shift the location of ads to less favorable locations. For example, app developers have developed ad blocking apps for smartphones and other mobile devices which may hinder marketing activities to smartphone users. The adoption of such technologies, tools, software, and applications could reduce the number of display and search advertisements that we or our third-party publishers are able to deliver and this, in turn, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nMajor browsers such as Google Chrome and Apple Safari have begun eliminating the use of third-party cookies. In general, while we rely on internally created identifiers to associate returning users with their user profile, we and our third party advertisers use cookies to track user attributes and conversions. While the digital advertising industry has sought to mitigate the impact of the elimination of cookies by using other conversion tracking technologies, the effect of this change on our business is uncertain.\nMore significantly, companies and new laws and regulations such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) are moving to limit online user-level tracking including conversion data as part of the push for enhanced data privacy protection. Use of conversion data such as whether a user downloads and installs an app may be limited which may inhibit our clients\u2019 and our ability to use this data, making it harder to efficiently manage our respective operations. For example, Apple\u2019s 2021 update to iOS defaults to blocking ad tracking which makes it difficult for us and our advertiser clients to track conversions and for clients\u2019 to determine their ROAS. This may lead some advertisers to curtail their ad spend or may force other clients to stop online advertising all together. If there is less demand for online advertising services such as those we provide, the prices for such services could decline, adversely affecting our results.\nThe move away from user level tracking may also adversely impact the efficiency of ad platforms such as those operated by Google and Facebook and other social media platforms which could lead to increases in the cost of media. Many of our publishers buy media on these platforms and they may seek to pass along their increased media costs to us.\nInterruptions, failures or defects in our data collection systems, as well as privacy concerns and regulatory changes or enforcement actions affecting our ability to collect user data, could also limit our ability to analyze data from, and thereby optimize, our clients\u2019 marketing campaigns. If our access to data is limited in the future, we may be unable to provide effective services to clients and may lose clients and revenue.\nRisks Related to Our Owned Media Properties\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to enhance and adapt our products and services to address the evolving needs of our clients and keep pace with rapidly changing technologies.\nThe digital advertising and marketing industry is characterized by rapidly changing standards and technologies, frequent new product and service introductions, and changing user and client demands. As our users\u2019 and clients\u2019 needs evolve, we will need to continue to enhance our services and solutions to address these needs in order to maintain these relationships. We have invested in developing new products, markets, services and technologies, including migrating our legacy database to a new environment and developing a replacement for the back-end system that currently supports our consumer facing websites. We have also expanded our work force to enable us to upgrade our systems, meet the needs of our users and clients and continue to grow our revenues and business. However, based on our experience, new websites, systems, products and services may be less predictable and have lower margins than more established websites, products and services and may be more prone to technological instability or failure. Further, we may not be able to develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner, or at all. The time, expense and effort associated with developing and offering new and enhanced products, services and back-end systems may be greater than anticipated. If we are unsuccessful in enhancing and upgrading our websites, products, services and back-end systems, we may fail to maintain our profitability, attract new clients or grow our revenue, or we may suffer service disruptions. Moreover, if we are unable to develop and bring to market additional products and services, and enhancements in a timely manner, or at all, we could lose market share to competitors who are able to offer such new products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the introduction of new technologies and services, including voice assistance, artificial intelligence, internet-of-things and machine learning, and the emergence of new industry standards and practices related to these technological developments could render our existing technologies and services obsolete and unmarketable or require unanticipated investments in technology. In particular, as we continue to transition to cloud-based technology and migrate our database to a new environment, we may face new and additional costs to operate our business.\nWhile we continually make enhancements and other modifications to our proprietary technologies, such changes may contain design or performance defects that are not readily apparent. If our proprietary technologies fail to achieve their intended purpose or are less effective than technologies used by our competitors, our business could be harmed.\nOur future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully adapt to our clients\u2019 and users\u2019 needs and the rapidly changing digital media formats and other technologies. If we fail to adapt successfully or as quickly as our competitors, it could damage our reputation and our relationships with our clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAn increasing number of people are accessing content on their mobile devices through mobile applications. Our ability to remain competitive with the shift to mobile apps is critical to maintaining our revenue and profitability.\nMobile devices are the primary means by which people access online content. While our websites are designed with a \u201cmobile first\u201d approach, the vast majority of consumers' time accessing content on mobile devices is increasingly through mobile applications, rather than mobile browsers. At this time, mobile applications are not a primary driver of our business, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace. If we experience difficulties developing mobile apps, getting them available in the Google Play and Apple App stores and ultimately installed and used by consumers, or if we experience problems promoting our apps on social media platforms such as Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram or TikTok, our consumer acquisition capabilities and our growth may be impaired.\nAs a result of eliminating the use of cookies, blocking user level tracking and changes in mobile app measurement analytic tools, advertisers and mobile app providers will have to develop new strategies to manage and optimize their campaigns. These changes may make it more difficult for our mobile app initiatives to achieve profitability.\nWe could lose clients if we fail to adequately detect click-through or other fraud on advertisements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraudulent clicks or actions on our websites or our third-party publishers\u2019 websites, which could lead our clients to become dissatisfied with our campaigns and, in turn, lead to a loss of clients and related revenue. Click-through fraud occurs when automated systems (sometimes called \"bots\") are used to create an individual click on an ad displayed on a website, with the intent of generating a revenue share payment to the publisher, rather than an individual user actually viewing the underlying content. Action fraud occurs when online lead forms are completed with false or fictitious information in an effort to increase a publisher\u2019s compensable actions. The risk of fraud may increase as bots become more sophisticated and difficult to detect. We do not charge our clients for fraudulent clicks or actions when they are detected, and such fraudulent activities could negatively affect our profitability or harm our reputation. If fraudulent clicks or actions are not detected, the affected clients may experience a reduced return on their investment in our marketing programs, which could lead the clients to become dissatisfied with our campaigns, and in turn, lead to loss of clients and related revenue. Additionally, we have terminated and may, in the future, terminate our relationships with publishers who we believe to have engaged in fraud. We may not be able to replace the terminated publishers with new publishers which could result in a reduction in traffic to our sites and registrations.\nOur rewards fulfillment costs have increased over the last two years, which has impacted and may continue to impact our results of operations.\nOur rewards sites generate the majority of our revenues and gross profit. Users who complete the program requirements and are verified during the claims process can earn valuable rewards such as gift cards, merchandise and cash equivalents. Over the past two years, we have experienced an increased number of users who have claimed rewards, which reduces the profitability of this part of our business. We recently revamped our reward program to allow users more opportunities to claim rewards at different reward values and provided more deal choices as well as we changed the number of deals required to get rewards at the differing values. It is uncertain the impact the program changes will have on our rewards sites in general and the levels of rewards fulfillment. Users may find our revamped rewards program to be less attractive, which could adversely affect our results. Moreover, we are also subject to the risk of being \u201cgamed\u201d by users who seek to claim rewards but are not entitled to do so because of their use of bots or other deceptive means. Gaming, to the extent successful, adversely affects our results. Conversely, if we deny rewards to users who we believe have gamed, these users may seek to damage our reputation by filing complaints with the Better Business Bureau or State consumer protection agencies or by posting negative online reviews.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from and occasionally have payment disputes with our clients, and we may not be able to collect on amounts owed to us.\nWe regularly extend payment terms to our clients, which exposes us to risk of bad debt. In addition, some of our clients are thinly capitalized and pose credit risks, and we may have difficulty collecting on amounts owed to us. Some of our clients may challenge the determination of amounts we believe they owe or may refuse to pay because of performance-related or other claims. In these circumstances, we may have difficulty collecting on amounts we believe are owed.\nA small portion of our client business is sourced through advertising agencies and brokers. In many cases, agencies are not required to pay us unless and until they are paid by the underlying client. In addition, many agencies and brokers are thinly capitalized and have or may develop high-risk credit profiles. If an agency or broker becomes insolvent, or if an underlying client does not pay the agency or broker, we may be required to write off accounts receivable as bad debt.\nAdditionally, while we do not have significant concentration in one industry vertical, we do have exposure with respect to clients in particular verticals where there is a risk of tightening regulations or restrictions on sourcing consumer traffic. For example, if new regulations affect our clients such that their businesses are no longer viable, our clients may become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay amounts owed to us. In such circumstances, we may be exposed to risks of significant bad debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOther Business Risks\nOur operations have grown significantly over the past several years, which may make it difficult to effectively manage any future growth and scale our infrastructure and products quickly enough to meet our business's and our clients\u2019 needs while maintaining profitability.\nWe have historically experienced growth in our operations and have relied in large part on proprietary systems. As a result of this growth and the need to update our systems to be more scalable and to accommodate changes in data privacy and data protection laws, we are in the midst of upgrading our systems and infrastructure. Future growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure.\nOur future success depends in part on the efficient performance of our ad serving and lead generation systems and technology infrastructure. As the number of websites and internet users and the amount of data collected increases, we have begun to revamp our technology infrastructure to accommodate this increased volume. Moreover, we have rearchitected our database of consumer information to accommodate users' exercise of their privacy rights in their personal information under new data privacy and data protection laws such as the CCPA, the General Data Privacy Regulation (\"GDPR\") and the UK-GDPR. Unexpected constraints on our technology infrastructure could lead to slower website response times or system failures and adversely affect the availability of our websites and the level of user responses received, which could result in the loss of clients or revenue or have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.\nWe are continuing to upgrade our other systems, procedures, processes and controls to support our future operations. We have incurred significant expenditures and have been forced to reallocate valuable management resources to facilitate these upgrades. We have incurred substantial costs to secure hosting, other technical services and additional data storage and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our owned-and-operated websites. We have also deployed new products and services and third party solutions to respond to an increasing volume of data privacy requests. These upgrades and expansion in our technical capabilities are costly and complex and could result in inefficiencies or operational failures which could damage our reputation and cause us to lose current and potential users and clients and could harm our operating results.\nHistorically, our quarterly and annual results of operations have been subject to fluctuations due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. As we continue to grow, we may not be able to increase our market share and/or sustain our recent growth. Our inability to sustain our growth could cause our performance and outlook to be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors.\nThe expansion of our international operations subjects us to increased challenges and risks.\nWe have begun expanding our website offerings into additional international markets beyond the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia and we may expand further into additional countries. Our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, legal and regulatory systems, taxation regimes, and commercial infrastructures. Continued international expansion will require us to invest significant funds and other resources and may subject us to new risks that we have not faced before or increase risks that we currently face, including risks associated with:\n\u2022\ncompliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations and adapting to foreign customs and practices as they relate to our business;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the GDPR and other foreign data privacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations and the risks and costs of noncompliance;\n\u2022\ncross-border data transfers among us, our subsidiaries, and our customers, vendors, and business partners;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and added costs of conducting our business in foreign languages, including the need to retool our consumer facing product offerings to better align with local customs, practices and consumer acceptance of our product offerings;\n\u2022\ncredit risk and higher levels of payment fraud, as well as longer sales or collection cycles in some countries;\n\u2022\ncompliance with anti-bribery laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\nrecruiting, training, managing and retaining employees in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nincreased competition from local providers;\n\u2022\neconomic and political instability in some countries, including as a result of health concerns, terrorist attacks and civil unrest;\n\u2022\nless protective intellectual property laws;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the laws of numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions in which we conduct business, potential double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in applicable U.S. and foreign tax laws; and\n\u2022\noverall higher costs of doing business internationally.\nIf our revenue from our international operations does not exceed the expense of establishing and maintaining these operations, our business and operating results could suffer and we may decide to make changes to our business or exit certain jurisdictions in an effort to mitigate losses. If we are unable to successfully manage the risks and costs associated with international operations, it could adversely affect our business and/or results of operations.\nAs we continue to grow our business, we may acquire additional businesses or personnel, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, disrupt our operations or otherwise subject us to risks inherent in identifying, acquiring and operating newly acquired business units.\nAs we continue to grow our business, we may continue to acquire additional business units and personnel that we believe will complement or expand our current business or offer growth opportunities. We may experience difficulties in identifying potential acquisition candidates that complement our current business at appropriate prices. We cannot guarantee that our acquisition strategy will be successful. We may spend significant management time and resources in analyzing and negotiating acquisitions or investments that are not consummated or cannot be implemented successfully. Furthermore, the ongoing process of integrating an acquired business unit or personnel is distracting, time-consuming, expensive and requires continuous optimization and allocation of resources, any of which could disrupt our operations.\nFor example, we completed the AdParlor Acquisition on July 1, 2019, the acquisition of a 50% of the equity of Winopoly, LLC (\"Winopoly\") on April 1, 2020, and the remaining 50% equity interest on September 1, 2021. The integration of these businesses and their employees has required, and will continue to require, a significant investment of the time and resources of Fluent\u2019s management team. Any future acquisitions we make could compound those costs and have an adverse impact on our business and/or results of operations.\nMoreover, if we use stock as consideration for any future acquisition, this would dilute our existing shareholders, and if we use cash, this would reduce our liquidity and impact our financial flexibility. We may seek debt financing for particular acquisitions, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot overcome these and other challenges associated with a business acquisition strategy, we may not consummate or realize tangible benefits from any future acquisitions, which could impair our overall business results.\nAdditionally, as a part of our continuous efforts to invest in opportunities to grow the Fluent business, we have occasionally done so via the addition of personnel at all levels and the investment of time and resources into ventures that expand beyond our core operations. When certain of these ventures have failed to achieve key performance milestones, we have scaled back our investments, up to and including reductions in our work force. We will continue to explore opportunities to grow the Company's business, and if we determine that certain of these ventures are not viable, we will need to make similar cutbacks, which may have a significant impact to our business and operating results.\nUnfavorable global economic conditions, including health and safety concerns around the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy, including conditions that are outside of our control, such as the impact of health and safety concerns from the outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus. The COVID-19 pandemic initially resulted in extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets and has had a sustained impact on supply chains. Recently, the rate of inflation has increased. A weak or declining economy could also put pressure on our media supply channels.\nAfter the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain advertisers in industry verticals such as staffing and recruitment and financial products and services began to reduce their spend with us, while certain advertisers in other verticals, such as streaming services and mobile gaming, increased their demand, with many consumers spending more time on their mobile devices during the period of social isolation. As the pandemic has progressed, these trends have changed and we expect there will be continuing changes as our clients and users adjust to the changing circumstances. We anticipate additional shifts in pricing and/or demand among affected clients as the trajectory of the pandemic and future economic outlook remain uncertain. While the combination of these trends did not result in a significant disruption to our business in the year ended December 31, 2021, the trajectory of these trends is uncertain. These trends, or others that have yet to be identified, may persist or change and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in subsequent periods. The extent of any impact is uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nAdditionally, our business relies heavily on people, and adverse events such as health-related concerns about working in our offices, the inability to travel and other matters affecting the general work environment could harm our business. We implemented company-wide work-from-home beginning on March 13, 2020. During the second quarter of 2021, we opened our headquarters to employees that meet health protocols and voluntarily choose to work in the office. To date, our staff largely continues to work remotely. While we have adapted to a work-from-home environment, we continue to believe that it would be preferable for our employees to work in our offices and believe that working remotely increases the likelihood of business disruptions which could adversely impact our business operations including and create challenges to our technological capacity and cybersecurity capabilities, as well as cause operational inefficiencies and lead to the diminution in the loyalty and goodwill of our employees. Despite not utilizing our offices at pre-pandemic levels, we have not been able to significantly reduce our occupancy costs to this point.\nIf we lose the services of any of our key personnel, it could adversely affect our business.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including Donald Patrick, our Chief Executive Officer, Ryan Schulke, our Chief Strategy Officer, Matthew Conlin, our Chief Customer Officer and other key employees in all areas of our organization, each of whom is important to the management of certain aspects of our business and operations and the development of our strategic direction, and each of whom may be difficult to replace. The loss of the services of these key individuals and the process to replace these individuals could involve significant time and expense and could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nAdditionally, given the number of employees we have relative to our revenue, we rely heavily upon certain key employees to support different operational functions, with limited redundancy in capacity. The loss of any of these key employees could adversely affect our operations until a qualified replacement is hired and trained. Since we began working remotely, we have experienced greater turnover and due to the current tight job environment, we have had to increase compensation packages to attract new hires and retain our existing employees, all of which has added to our human capital costs.\nWe also believe that, as our business continues to grow, our future success depends, in large part, upon our ability to hire and retain highly skilled managerial, technical and operational personnel. Competition for such personnel is considerable, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled personnel.\nBecause the majority of our employees are working remotely, our ability to attract and retain employees based on corporate culture may be adversely affected and, if we are unable to maintain it as we grow, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nNow that our employees are largely working remotely, we are not able to have the types of events and interpersonal connections that helped foster our culture. As is the case with many organizations, we have experienced higher levels of turnover during the pandemic and hiring has been increasingly difficult with new hires commanding higher salaries. The failure to maintain the key aspects of our culture as our organization grows could result in decreased employee satisfaction, increased difficulty in attracting top talent, increased turnover and could compromise the quality of our client service, all of which are important to our success and to the effective execution of our business strategy. If we are unable to maintain our corporate culture as we grow, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe are dependent upon third-party service providers in our operations.\nWe utilize numerous third-party service providers in our operations such as cloud-based hosting services, enterprise resource planning systems and other Saas platform and services. As failure by a third-party service provider could expose us to an inability to operate our websites, connect our advertiser clients with users, provide online marketing and advertising services or track the performance and results of our online marketing activities. As with all software and web applications and systems, there may be, from time to time, technical malfunctions that arise with some of these third-party providers. It is possible that to remedy any such situation would require substantial time, resources and technical knowledge that we may not have or be able to acquire in a timely fashion. Additionally, some of these third-party service providers may face financial instability, which could lead to extended periods in which their platforms or applications are unavailable or fail to accurately track or account for online activity. If any of these platforms or applications goes down for an extended period of time, it is possible that we may lose clients and/or incur significant costs to either internalize some of these services or find suitable alternatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nOur business is subject to a significant number of governmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses or reduce the availability or effectiveness of our solutions, and failure to comply with them could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities.\nOur business is subject to regulation under a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations. Our operations in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d), Canada and Australia are subject to laws, rules and regulations affecting our operations in those countries. These U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations are generally designed to regulate and prevent deceptive practices in advertising, online marketing and telemarketing, to protect the privacy of the public, and to prevent the misuse of personal information available in the marketplace. Many of these laws and regulations, which can be enforced by government entities or, in some cases, private parties, are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent over time. In addition, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and they may be interpreted and applied inconsistently across jurisdictions or with our current policies and practices. New laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our clients' businesses could affect their activities or operations and, therefore, lead to reductions in their levels of business with us. We incur significant expenses in our attempt to maintain or bring our business in compliance with these new and existing laws and in defending ourselves in litigation, all of which can be costly to the business and could adversely affect our revenue or results of operations.\nWe supply data to Fluent Sales Solutions, our captive call center, as well as third-party call center clients for telemarketing and text messaging campaigns and manage text messaging campaigns to re-engage with our users, all of which may subject us or our clients to claims under the TCPA and the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (\u201cTSR\u201d) and State telemarketing laws. In recent years, the TCPA has become a fertile source for both individual and class action lawsuits and regulatory actions. Although we have not experienced material losses from TCPA claims to this point, we have expended considerable resources to comply with the TCPA and defend ourselves against legal claims, in addition to costs to insure against TCPA-related claims. Changes in the interpretation of the TCPA or the TSR may adversely impact our telemarketing clients and our text messaging campaigns. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement appropriate processes and procedures in response to and to defend against TCPA- and TSR-related claims could result in legal and monetary liability, significant fines and penalties, or damage to our reputation in the marketplace, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate internal email campaigns to promote our owned and operated websites and utilize third party publishers who use email to generate traffic for our websites and to promote our advertisers\u2019 products. As a result of these activities, we and our email publishers are subject to various state and federal laws regulating commercial email communications, including the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (\u201cCAN Spam\u201d) and the California Business and Professions Code Sec. 17529.5 (\u201cCAL Anti-Spam Act\u201d). If we or any of our third-party publishers fail to comply with any provisions of these laws or regulations, we could be subject to regulatory investigation, enforcement actions, litigation or claims. Moreover, the deliverability of our emails could be adversely affected by spam filters employed by email service providers such as Gmail and Outlook and by users which could adversely affect the performance of our email marketing efforts.\nLaws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and the handling of personal information are complex and evolving. While we strive to comply with all legal and contractual obligations regarding these matters, any failure or perceived failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we collect, store, process, use and sell data, some of which contains personal information, we are subject to complex and evolving federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as contractual requirements, regarding privacy, data protection and the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of personal information. These laws and regulations involve matters central to our business, including user privacy, data protection, content, intellectual property, electronic contracts and other communications, e-commerce, sweepstakes, rewards and other promotional marketing campaigns, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation, libel, defamation, internet or data usage, and online payment services. Both in the United States and abroad, these laws and regulations continuously evolve and remain subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the rapidly evolving industry in which we operate.\nThe GDPR, which was adopted by the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and took effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR imposed new requirements on entities and granted individuals new rights in connection with the collection, use and storage of the personal information of EU residents. The UK adopted the UK-GDPR which took effect prior to Brexit is largely identical to the GDPR and together with the provisions of the UK Data Protection Act of 2018 and the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications regulate data privacy and data protection in the UK. The fines for failing to comply with the GDPR, and starting in 2021, the UK GDPR, are significant (up to 4% of global turnover capped at \u00a317.5m), and the potential ways that the regime could be applied to a business such as ours are uncertain.\nThe increased scrutiny regarding environmental, employment, social, and governance matters could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to retain employees, and the willingness of customers and others to do business with us.\nThere is an increasing focus from investors, regulators, employees and other corporate stakeholders on corporate policies addressing environmental, employment, social, and governance matters. Stakeholder expectations regarding appropriate corporate conduct on these matters are continually evolving, as are expectations regarding appropriate methods and types of related corporate disclosure. Investors, regulators, employees or other corporate stakeholders may not be satisfied with our existing environmental, employment, social, and governance practices or those of our customers, advertisers, publishers or vendors. These stakeholders may also be dissatisfied with the pace at which any revisions to our practices or the practices of our advertisers, publishers, or vendors are adopted and implemented. Further, investors and other stakeholders may object to the societal costs or ethical or other implications, or the perceived costs or implications, associated with the use of our services or the products made by one or more of our advertisers. If any of these events were to occur, our reputation, our ability to retain employees, and the willingness of advertisers, publishers, and others to do business with us may be materially and adversely impacted. We may also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with related corporate disclosure obligations in the future, whether those obligations are imposed by law, regulation, or market expectation.\nCalifornia enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), the first U.S. comprehensive data privacy law, which took effect on January 1, 2020 and established requirements for businesses who collect and sell personal information and granted individual rights with respect to their personal information. California recently adopted the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), which takes effect on January 1, 2023 and expands the rights afforded California consumers with respect to their personal information, adopts certain GDPR principles such as data minimization and established the California Privacy Protection Agency, which has investigatory, rulemaking and enforcement powers. Nevada has also adopted a law that permits its residents to request that their personal information not be sold, and Virginia and Colorado recently adopted a data privacy law similar to the CCPA but with additional consumer privacy rights, both of which take effect in 2023. Because of the volume of user registrations on our owned-and-operated websites, we receive requests from a number of users per day seeking to exercise their privacy rights. Consequently, we implemented a third-party solution to support our systems and processes to handle these requests. We have already devoted significant resources to handling data privacy requests and expect to incur additional costs to maintain compliance with the evolving data privacy and data protection laws and regulations.\nCurrently, there are bills pending in about thirty states that deal with data privacy. The proposed laws provide for data privacy rules similar to the CCPA and/or the GDPR, while some of the proposed laws include a private right of action to enforce noncompliance, which, if enacted, would expose us to potential litigation and claims. If some or all of the proposed privacy laws are enacted, it will be extremely difficult and expensive to comply, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so or that the costs of compliance will not be prohibitively expensive, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWhile we strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection, to the extent possible, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in new ways or in a manner that is inconsistent across jurisdictions and may conflict with other rules or our practices, or that new regulations could be enacted. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, privacy-related obligations to users or other third parties, or privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of sensitive information, which may include personally identifiable information or other user data, may result in investigations, claims, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations, and declines in user growth, retention, or engagement, any of which could seriously harm our business. Additionally, compliance with privacy and security laws, requirements and regulations may result in cost increases due to new constraints on our business, the development of new processes, the effects of potential non-compliance by us or third-party service providers, and enforcement actions.\nThe outcome of litigation, inquiries, investigations, examinations or other legal proceedings in which we are involved, in which we may become involved, or in which our clients or competitors are involved could distract management, increase our expenses or subject us to significant monetary damages or restrictions on our ability to do business.\nDue to the complex regulatory scheme in which we operate and the heightened scrutiny on our business, legal proceedings arise periodically in the normal course of our business. These may include individual consumer cases, class action lawsuits and inquiries, investigations, examinations, regulatory proceedings or other actions brought by federal (e.g., the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") or state (e.g., state attorneys general) authorities. We are currently subject to various pending governmental and regulatory investigations and we could be subject to more in the future. Any negative outcomes from regulatory actions or litigation or claims, including monetary penalties or damages or injunctive provisions regulating or restricting how can we conduct our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nFor example, on October 26, 2018, the Company received a subpoena from the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office (\u201cNY AG\u201d) regarding compliance with New York Executive Law \u00a7 63(12) and New York General Business Law \u00a7 349, as they relate to the collection, use, or disclosure of information from or about consumers or individuals, as such information was submitted to the Federal Communication Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) in connection with the FCC\u2019s rulemaking proceeding captioned \u201cRestoring Internet Freedom,\u201d WC Docket No. 17-108. The Company also received subpoenas from the United States Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) on December 13, 2018, and the Office of the Attorney General of the District of Columbia (\"DC AG\") on March 12, 2020, regarding the same issue. On May 6, 2021, the Company and the NY AG executed an Assurance of Discontinuance (the \u201cAOD\u201d) to resolve this matter which imposed injunctive provisions on the Company\u2019s practices with regard to political advocacy campaigns, most of which the Company had already implemented, and imposed a $3.7 million penalty.\nAdditionally, on January 28, 2020, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (\u201cCID\u201d) from the FTC regarding compliance with the FTC Act and the TSR, as they relate to the advertising, marketing, promotion, offering for sale, or sale of rewards and other products, the transmission of commercial text messages, and/or consumer privacy or data security. We have been fully cooperating with the FTC and completed our initial discovery submissions to the FTC in 2020.\nOn October 6, 2020, the Company received notice from the Pennsylvania Office of the Attorney General (\u201cPA OAG\u201d) that it was reviewing the Company\u2019s business practices for compliance under the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-1 et seq.; the Telemarketer Registration Act, 73 P.S. \u00a7 2241 et. seq., and the Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 C.F.R. 310 et seq. The Company has been responsive and is fully cooperating with the PA OAG. At this time, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or the significance, if any, to the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial position . At this time, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the FTC or PA OAG matters or the significance, if any, to our business, results of operations or financial position. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings for more information on each of these matters.\nRegardless of whether any current or future claims in which we are involved have merit, or whether we are ultimately held liable or subject to payment of penalties or consumer redress, such investigations and claims have been and may continue to be expensive to defend, may divert management\u2019s time away from our operations and may result in changes to our business practices that adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe scope and outcome of these proceedings is often difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in lawsuits may seek recovery of large amounts, and the cost to defend such litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity and uncertainty associated with investigations, litigation and orders (whether pertaining to us, our clients or our competitors) that could diminish consumers' view of our services and/or result in material discovery expenses. In addition, a court-ordered injunction or an administrative cease-and-desist order or settlement may require us to modify our business practices or prohibit conduct that would otherwise be legal and in which our competitors may engage. Many of the complex and technical statutes to which we are subject, including state and federal financial privacy requirements, may provide for civil and criminal penalties and may permit consumers to bring individual or class action lawsuits against us and obtain statutorily prescribed damages. Additionally, our clients might face similar proceedings, actions or inquiries which could affect their businesses and, in turn, our ability to do business with those clients.\nWhile we do not believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened legal proceeding, investigation, examination or supervisory activity will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, such events are inherently uncertain and adverse outcomes could result in significant monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us.\nOur business and the businesses of our advertiser clients may be subject to sales and use tax and other taxes.\nThe application of sales and use tax, goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipt tax on our digital marketing/advertising services is complex and evolving. In general, advertising services are considered a service and are generally not subject to sales and use tax, but some States may seek to impose sales tax on some or all of our revenue streams. We generate revenue from users who sign up for streaming services on our websites and some states have imposed taxes on streaming services which could make streaming services less attractive to our users. Other states, including New York, impose a sales tax on \u201cinformation services.\u201d In New York, the sales tax explicitly excludes \u201cadvertising\u201d services from sales and use tax; however, the line between non-enumerated services, excluded advertising services and taxable information services may, in practice, be unclear. Further complicating the determination of the sales taxability of services is the need to determine where the revenues from the services are sourced (i.e., where the service is rendered, where the service is consumed or where the information is accessed).\nIn addition, many state governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenues to make up for budget shortfalls and/or offset sales tax revenues lost from online sales of merchandise. Prior to the 2018 Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v Wayfair, Inc., online merchants with no physical presence in a state were, in general, not required to collect and remit sales taxes. Since Wayfair which adopted an economic nexus test, many states have implemented laws that require remote sellers of goods and services to collect and remit sales taxes on sales to customers within the jurisdiction based on economic nexus (i.e., where the business exceeds a dollar volume or number of transactions in the jurisdiction), even when the seller has no physical presence within the jurisdiction. In states that adopt economic nexus and also tax specified enumerated services, if our services are found to be subject to that state\u2019s sales tax on services, we may have to collect and remit sales tax, which adds complexity and compliance costs and due to the increased overall cost of our service, could make our service offerings less attractive and adversely affect our business.\nWe are currently undergoing two sales and use tax audits by the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance (the \u201cTax Department\u201d), which has taken the position that revenue derived from certain of our customer acquisition and list management services is subject to sales tax, as a result of being deemed information services, which we dispute on several grounds. On July 22 and 31, 2020, we received notices of determination from the Tax Department totaling $3.0 million, including $0.7 million of interest, and we filed challenges to the notices of determination on October 16, 2020. While we continue to dispute the Tax Department's position, it is probable that a sales tax liability may result from this matter and have an $0.8 million accrual in connection with the audits. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for more information on this matter.\nRisks Relating to Data Security and Intellectual Property\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data, and our actual or perceived failure to safeguard such data and user privacy could damage our reputation and brand and harm our business and results of operations.\nThe user profiles in our database contain user information such as name, age, personal address, phone number, email address, survey responses and transactional data. Our ability to provide services using that information is critical, and a breach of the security measures on our systems or on those of our third-party vendors could result in the misappropriation of either our proprietary information or the personal information of users that we collect, or the interruption or breakdown of our operations. Our business is largely dependent on consumer-facing websites, which could become inaccessible due to service interruptions or subject to hacking or computer attacks. If our websites are unavailable when users attempt to access them, or if they do not load as quickly as expected, users may not return as often in the future, or at all.\nAlthough we continue to enhance our physical and cyber security controls and associated procedures, we cannot guarantee that our websites, database and information technology systems, and those of our third-party service providers, will be free of security breaches, computer malware or viruses, phishing impersonation attacks, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, ransomware and similar incidents or disruptions from unauthorized use of our database and systems.\nCybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years, in part, because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to exchange information and conduct transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of computer hackers, organized crime, terrorists, and other external parties, including foreign state actors. We have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the target of future cyberattacks. These cyberattacks could include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or information, improper access by employees or third-party partners or other security breaches that have or could in the future result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our confidential, proprietary and other information, confidential and other information concerning employees or consumers, monetary loss, or otherwise materially disrupt our or our other third party partners\u2019 network access or business operations.\nWe cannot be certain that our efforts, as well as those of our third-party partners and service providers, will be able to prevent breaches of the security of our information systems and technology. If we, or any of our third-party partners and service providers, experience compromises to security that result in performance or availability of our websites or mobile application, the complete shutdown of our websites or mobile applications or the loss or unauthorized disclosure, access, acquisition, alteration or use of confidential information, consumers, publishers and advertisers may lose trust and confidence in us, and consumers may decrease the use of our websites, advertisers may stop using our services and/or publishers may stop providing media to us. Further, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or our users, to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our systems, information or our consumers\u2019 information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target, and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nAny or all of these issues could adversely affect our ability to attract new users and increase engagement by existing users, cause advertisers to not use our services or cause publishers to stop providing media or subject us to governmental or third-party lawsuits, investigations, regulatory fines or other actions or liability, thereby harming our business. Although we are not aware of any material information security incidents to date, we have detected common types of attempts to attack our information systems and data using means that have included denial of service attacks and phishing.\nThere are numerous federal, state and local laws in the United States and around the world regarding privacy and the collection, processing, storing, sharing, disclosing, using, cross-border transfer and protecting of personal information and other data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and which may be costly to comply with, may result in regulatory fines or penalties, and may be inconsistent between countries and jurisdictions or conflict with other rules. We are subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties. While we strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection, to the extent possible, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in new ways or in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices or that new laws or regulations could be enacted. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to consumers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of sensitive information, which could include personally identifiable information or other user data, may result in governmental investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others, and could cause consumers and our advertisers and publishers to lose trust in us, all of which could be costly and have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, new and changed rules and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and cross-border transfers of consumer information could cause us to delay planned uses and disclosures of data to comply with applicable privacy and data protection requirements. Moreover, if third parties that we work with violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations also may put user information at risk and could in turn harm our reputation, business and operating results.\nIf we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position and business may suffer.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon our proprietary systems and technology. We rely on trade secret, trademark and copyright law, confidentiality agreements, and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisers, client vendors and publishers. These agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or unauthorized parties from copying aspects of our services or obtaining and using our proprietary information. Further, these agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosures or uses, and we cannot guarantee that our rights under such agreements will be enforceable.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our website features, software and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary. For example, third party website operators have created look-alike sites of our reward sites. Some of these sites contain links to our Terms, Privacy Policies and/or customer service. These sites divert traffic away from our sites, expose us to regulatory scrutiny as the look-alike sites often have compliance issues and create consumer confusion and could damage our reputation. When we become aware of look-alike sites we use available means to have them removed. Despite our efforts to monitor the Internet for look-alike sites, there can be no assurance that we will be able to quickly detect and remove look-alike sites which can adversely affect our business, impair our reputation, or expose us to regulatory scrutiny.\nPolicing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights can be difficult and costly. Litigation, while it may be necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention and could adversely affect our business, even if we are successful on the merits. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases, we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties.\nAs a creator and a distributor of digital media content, we face liability and expenses for legal claims based on the nature and content of the materials that we create or distribute, including materials provided by third parties. If we are required to pay damages or expenses in connection with these legal claims, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe display original content and third-party content on our websites and in our marketing messages. As a result, we have faced and will continue to face potential liability based on a variety of theories, including deceptive advertising and copyright or trademark infringement. We generally rely on the \u201cfair use\u201d exception for our use of third-party brand names and marks, but these third parties may disagree, and the laws governing the fair use of these third-party materials are imprecise and adjudicated on a case-by-case basis. We also create content we believe to be original for our websites. While we do not believe that this content infringes on any third-party copyrights or other intellectual property rights, owners of competitive websites that present similar content have taken and may take the position that our content infringes on their intellectual property rights. We are also exposed to risk that content provided by third parties is inaccurate or misleading, and for material posted to our websites by users and other third parties. These claims could divert management time and attention away from our business and result in significant costs to investigate and defend, regardless of the merit of these claims. The general liability and cyber/technology errors and omissions insurance we maintain may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance, or is in excess of insurance coverage, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Financial Matters\nCovenants in our Credit Agreement impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe Credit Agreement contains a number of significant restrictions and negative and affirmative covenants that may limit our operating and financial flexibility. The Credit Agreement contains negative covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to: incur indebtedness; grant liens on its assets; enter into certain investments; consummate fundamental change transactions; engage in mergers or acquisitions or dispose of assets; enter into certain transactions with affiliates; make changes to its fiscal year; enter into certain restrictive agreements; and make certain restricted payments (including for dividends and stock repurchases, which are generally prohibited except in a few circumstances and/or up to specified amounts). The Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative covenants and customary events of default provisions, including, subject to thresholds and grace periods, among others, payment default, covenant default, cross default to other material indebtedness, and judgment default. Each of these limitations are subject to various conditions.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants, which require us to maintain minimum total leverage ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios. The applicable interest rate on the facility may increase if our total leverage ratio increases to specified amounts which would result in our interest expenses going up. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, we are required to make annual mandatory prepayments of 10% of the original principal amount of the facility and make other prepayments in certain circumstances prior to March 31, 2026, the Maturity Date of the facility.\nThese covenants could materially adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs. Furthermore, they may restrict our ability to expand and pursue our business strategies and otherwise conduct our business. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by circumstances and events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to comply with such covenants. These restrictions also limit our ability to obtain future financings or to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nA breach of any covenant in the Credit Agreement or the agreements governing any other indebtedness that we may have outstanding from time to time would result in a default under that agreement after any applicable grace periods. A default, if not waived, could result in an acceleration of the debt outstanding under the agreement and in a default with respect to, and an acceleration of, the debt outstanding under other debt agreements. If that occurs, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such debt. Even if new financing were available at such time, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us or terms as favorable as our current agreements. If our debt is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may require additional capital in the future in order to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. If capital is not available to us, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our growth and may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. While the Credit Agreement includes an undrawn revolving credit facility of up to $15 million that we can use subject to certain conditions, this may not be available or insufficient to meet our needs. In that event, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. However, additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Disruptions in the global equity and credit markets may also limit our ability to access capital.\nTo the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our shareholders would experience dilution, which may be significant and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Any debt financing, if available, may restrict our operations. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue certain operations. Any of these events could significantly harm our business and results of operations\nWe may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired.\nWe have a substantial amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of acquisitions. The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of an acquired business in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. The carrying value of intangible assets with identifiable useful lives are amortized based on their economic lives. Goodwill that is expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows is not amortized, but must be evaluated for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If necessary, a quantitative test is performed to compare the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value, as determined based on a discounted cash flow approach, or when available and appropriate, to comparable market values. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its current fair value, the asset is considered impaired and its carrying value is reduced to fair value through a non-cash charge to earnings. Events and conditions that could result in impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets include a reduced market capitalization, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, or other factors leading to reduction in expected long-term growth or profitability.\nGoodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment. Our stock price and any estimated control premium are factors affecting the assessment of the fair value of our underlying reporting units for purposes of performing any goodwill impairment assessment. We perform an impairment analysis of our goodwill annually and to date, no impairment of goodwill has been found as a result of these annual impairment tests however we were required to perform an interim impairment analysis for the second quarter of 2020 and recognized a goodwill impairment of $0.8 million in that quarter. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2021, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization resulted in a triggering event and we conducted an interim impairment test and determined that there was no impairment. We conducted our annual impairment analysis for 2021 and no impairment was found to exist.\nWe will continue to conduct impairment analyses of our goodwill on an annual basis, unless indicators of possible impairment arise that would cause a triggering event, and we would be required to do an interim impairment analysis and possible take additional impairment charges in the future. Further impairment charges to our goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and the Securities Markets\nOur stock price has been volatile and may be volatile in the future, and as a result, investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has been volatile and may be volatile in the future. We may incur rapid and substantial increases or decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future attributable to various factors including those discussed in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and may be unrelated to our operating performance or prospects and some of which are beyond our control. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our common stock. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including the following:\n\u2022\ninvestor reaction to our business strategy;\n\u2022\nthe success of our competitive services, products or technologies;\n\u2022 our continued compliance with the listing standards of NASDAQ;\n\u2022 regulatory or legal developments, especially changes in laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022 variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022 relatively low trading volume of our common stock, which tends to magnify volatility even in the absence of factors related to our business performance;\n\u2022\nthe emergence of new competitors or new technologies;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board or management;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or involvement in, regulatory investigations or litigation;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from such events, or the prospect of such events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public health issues including health epidemics or pandemics, and natural disasters such as fire, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or elsewhere, could disrupt our operations or result in political or economic instability.\nThese broad market and industry factors may seriously harm or harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Further, increases or decreases may be inconsistent with any improvements in actual or expected operating performance, financial condition or other indicators of value. Since the stock price of our common stock has been volatile and may be volatile in the future, investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. There can be no guarantee that our stock price will remain at current prices or that future sales of our common stock will not be at prices lower than those sold to investors.\nAdditionally, recently, securities of certain companies have experienced significant and extreme volatility in stock price due short sellers of shares of common stock, known as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d These short squeezes have caused extreme volatility in those companies and in the market and have led to the price per share of those companies to trade at a significantly inflated rate that is disconnected from the underlying value of the company. Many investors who have purchased shares in those companies at an inflated rate face the risk of losing a significant portion of their original investment as the price per share has declined steadily as interest in those stocks have abated. While we have no reason to believe our shares would be the target of a short squeeze, there can be no assurance that we won\u2019t be in the future, and you may lose a significant portion or all of your investment if you purchase our shares at a rate that is significantly disconnected from our underlying value.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership presents risks, including lack of liquidity in the trading market for our common stock and limitations on any individual stockholder's ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of December 31, 2021 , our executive officers, directors and holders of 10% or more of our outstanding common stock beneficially owned and have the ability to exercise some voting control over, in the aggregate, approximately 44.1% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these stockholders may be in a position to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and determination of significant corporate actions. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders, and these stockholders may act in a manner that advances their interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, which might affect the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, the concentration of stock ownership may also serve to limit the trading volume of our common stock and lead to greater volatility in our stock price. Our largest shareholder, Frost Gamma Investments Trust, owns, directly and indirectly, approximately 23.8% of our outstanding common stock. Frost Gamma Investments Trust has no obligation to provide us with advance notice of any sale or purchase of our common stock. If the concentration of our common stock ownership were to significantly shift, via sales of shares currently held by Frost Gamma Investments Trust or otherwise, we cannot predict the impact that any resulting change to the trading volume might have on our stock price.\nFuture issuances of shares of our common stock in connection with acquisitions or pursuant to our stock incentive plans could have a dilutive effect on your investment in us.\nDuring and we issued 4,415,005 shares of our common stock in connection with acquisitions, vesting of awards made under our and 2018 Stock Incentive Plan s (together, the \"Plans\"), and for other business purposes. Also, as of December 31, 2021 , an additional 6,148,654 shares underlying awards issued under the Plans, outstanding warrants and other compensatory arrangements might vest and be delivered through 2031 . The benefits derived by us from any future acquisition might not exceed the dilutive effect of the acquisition. Pursuant to the Plans, our board of directors has granted and may continue to grant stock options, restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d), or other equity awards to our directors and employees. When these awards vest or are exercised, the issuance of shares of common stock underlying these awards may have a dilutive effect on our common stock, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our Credit Agreement prohibits us from paying cash dividends on our common stock and contains limitations on our ability to redeem or repurchase shares of our common stock. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the trading price of your shares increases.\nWe are a \"smaller reporting company\" and avail ourselves of certain reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \"smaller reporting company,\" as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \"smaller reporting companies,\" including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer a \"smaller reporting company.\" We will remain a \"smaller reporting company\" while (i) the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates (our \"public float\") as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter is less than $250 million, or (ii) if our annual revenue as of our most recently completed fiscal year is less than $100 million and we have (A) no public float or (B) less than $700 million of public float as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.", "PERMNO": 92486, "SIC": 8742, "TIC": "FLNT"}
