{"cik": "896747", "company": "AMERICAN BIO MEDICA CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-04-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nBefore you make a decision to invest in our securities, you should consider carefully the risks described below, together with other information within this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other periodic reports filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). If any of the following events actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations and could result in a complete loss of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition\nWe have a history of incurring net losses. As of December 31, 2021, we have a stockholders\u2019 deficit.\nSince our inception and throughout most of our history, we have incurred net losses, including but not limited to, a net loss of $463,000 incurred in Fiscal 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we also reported negative stockholders\u2019 equity of $944,000. We incur substantial expenditures for sales and marketing, general and administrative and research and development purposes. Our ability to achieve profitability in the future will primarily depend on our ability to increase sales of our products. Stockholders\u2019 equity improvement will also be dependent on our ability to increase sales which will increase the value of our assets and decrease our liabilities. Future profitability is also dependent on our ability to reduce manufacturing costs and successfully introduce new products or new versions of our existing products into the marketplace. There can be no assurance that we will be able to increase our revenues at a rate that equals or exceeds expenditures. Our failure to increase sales while controlling sales and marketing, general and administrative, and research and development costs (relative to sales) would result in additional losses.\nOur inability to comply with our debt obligations could result in our creditors declaring all amounts owed to them due and payable with immediate effect, or result in the collection of collateral by the creditor, both of which would have an adverse material impact on our business and our ability to continue operations.\nWe have a credit facility with Crestmark Bank consisting of a revolving line of credit (the \u201cCrestmark LOC\u201d). The Crestmark LOC is secured by a first security interest in all of our receivables and inventory and security interest in all other assets of the Company (in accordance with permitted prior encumbrances), (together the \u201cCollateral\u201d).\nIn addition to the Crestmark LOC, we have a loan and security agreement with Cherokee Financial, LLC. (\u201cCherokee\u201d) which is secured by a first security interest in our real estate and machinery and equipment. We also have an unsecured term loan with Cherokee. We also have a number of smaller loans with individuals.\nIn addition to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control, our ability to make payments to our creditors will depend primarily upon our future operating performance; which has been negatively impacted by the loss of material contracts, the increased price competition in our core markets for drug testing and the continued negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our drug testing markets.\nA failure to repay any of our debt obligations could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the Company being required to pay much higher costs associated with the indebtedness and/or enable our creditors to declare all amounts owed to them due and payable with immediate effect. In fact, in February 2021, with the extension of the loans until February 2022, Cherokee imposed penalties in the amount of $120,000 in response to our inability to pay back our facilities along with increasing the interest rate on our larger facility from 8% to 10%. In February 2022, we did not repay the Cherokee loans. As of the date of this report, we are currently in discussions with Cherokee related to this non-payment which include, but are not limited to, possible payoff of the loans (via a refinance) or further extension of the loans.\nIf we are forced to refinance our debt on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition would be further adversely affected by increased costs and rates. We may also be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures or seeking additional equity capital. There can be no assurances that any of these strategies could be implemented on satisfactory terms, if at all, or that future borrowings or equity financing would be available for the payment of any indebtedness we may have. In addition, in an event of default, our creditors could begin proceedings to collect the collateral securing the debt. This would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations.\nWe may need additional funding for our existing and future operations.\nOur financial statements for Fiscal 2021 were prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. If sales continue to decline, our current cash balances and cash generated from future operations may not be sufficient to fund operations through April 2023. In addition, in February 2022, we were not able to repay certain loans when they were due and we are currently in discussions with the lender related to possible payoff (via a refinance) of the loans or to extend the due date of the loans. Future events, including the expenses and difficulties which may be encountered in maintaining a market for our products could make cash on hand and cash available under our line of credit facility insufficient to fund operations. If this happens, we may be required to sell equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. There can be no assurance that any of these financings will be available or that we will be able to complete such financing on satisfactory terms.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on our drug testing markets and our company operations; the degree to which the pandemic will continue to adversely affect our business, revenues, financial condition and results of operations is still uncertain.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 to be a pandemic (\u201cthe Pandemic\u201d). To date, the Pandemic has severely impacted levels of economic activity around the world. In response to this Pandemic, governments and public health officials of many countries, states, cities and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions to mitigate the spread and severity of Covid-19. The primary markets for our DOA products were all negatively impacted by the Pandemic in Fiscal 2021 and this negative impact continues in the early part of the year ending December 31, 2022. Declines in DOA sales were only nominally offset by our distribution sales of Covid-19 tests in Fiscal 2021 (unlike Fiscal 2020 when Covid-19 test sales significantly contributed to our revenues).\nIn Fiscal 2021, we experienced supply chain issues as a result of the Pandemic; particularly with plastics and other materials that are used to manufacture our dug tests that are also used in the manufacture of lateral flow Covid-19 tests. The lead times for materials increased significantly and in most cases without notice. This impairs our ability to deliver product to our customers within the time frame required and can result in loss of business.\nWe cannot presently predict the final scope and ultimate severity or duration of the Pandemic and any possible continued disruptions to our business, but the Pandemic and the resulting economic and commercial shutdowns to date have negatively impacted our ability to conduct business in accordance with our plans. Disruptions to our business include, but are not limited to, disruptions in our supply chain and reduced demand and/or suspension of operations by our customers. We cannot predict the degree to, or the time period over, which our business will continue to be negatively impacted by the Pandemic as the impact will depend on future developments which are evolving and highly uncertain. The extent to which distribution sales of Covid-19 tests may impact our business, operating results, financial condition, or liquidity in the future will depend on future developments which are also evolving and highly uncertain.\nOne of our customers accounted for more than 50% of our total net sales in Fiscal 2021.\nOne of our customers accounted for 57.5% and 35.2% of our net sales in Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively. We currently have a contract in place with this long-standing customer that does not expire in the near future. However, there can be no assurance that this customer, or any of our current customers will continue to place orders, or that orders by existing customers will continue at current or historical levels.\nOur ability to request purchases of shares of our common stock under our equity line of credit with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (\u201cLincoln Park\u201d) is dependent on the market value of our securities; and management has broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from sales of shares of common stock to Lincoln Park.\nOn December 9, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement and a Registration Rights Agreement with Lincoln Park under which Lincoln Park agreed to purchase up to $10,250,000 of shares of our common stock subject to certain limitations set forth in the Purchase Agreement, over a two year period. In Fiscal 2021, we sold 500,000 shares of common stock that represented the balance of the Initial Purchase and 6,000,000 shares of common stock to Lincoln Park as Regular Purchases; raising $639,000 in Fiscal 2021. However, one of the limitations under the Lincoln Park equity line of credit is that we cannot request a purchase of shares of common stock if the closing sale price of our common shares does not exceed $0.05. Our last purchase under the Lincoln Park equity line of credit was on October 1, 2021 as our ability to request purchases has been limited by the value of our securities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to request any further purchases from Lincoln Park for this reason along with the fact that a new registration statement would need to be filed to register additional shares of common stock.\nManagement has broad discretion as to the use of the net proceeds from our sale of shares of common stock to Lincoln Park (see Risk Factor \u201cThe sale or issuance of our common stock to Lincoln Park may cause dilution and the sale of the shares of common stock acquired by Lincoln Park, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our common stock to fall\u201d for more detail on Lincoln Park). Accordingly, shareholders are relying on the judgment of management with regard to the use of those net proceeds, and shareholders will not have the opportunity to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. The failure of management to use funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nWe depend on one individual to manage our business effectively.\nWe are dependent on the expertise and experience of one individual to manage all aspects of our business, the loss of whom could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Melissa A. Waterhouse serves as our sole executive officer. She serves as our Chief Executive Officer, President and Principal Financial Officer. We have an employment agreement in place with Ms. Waterhouse, but there can be no assurance that Ms. Waterhouse will continue her employment. The loss of Ms. Waterhouse could disrupt the business and have a negative impact on business results. We also have a limited number of individuals in senior management positions. There can be no assurance that they too will continue their employment. We do not currently maintain key man insurance on Ms. Waterhouse.\nWe rely on third parties for raw materials used in our drug test products and in our bulk test strip contract manufacturing processes as well as for supply of products we sell via distribution arrangements.\nWe currently have approximately 44 suppliers that provide us with the materials necessary to manufacture our drug-testing strips, our drug test kits and the products we supply third parties on a contract manufacturing basis as well as the products we sell to our customers via distribution arrangements. For most of our raw materials, we have multiple suppliers, but there are a few raw materials for which we only have one supplier. The loss of one or more of these suppliers, the non-performance of one or more of their materials or the lack of availability of raw materials could suspend our manufacturing process for one or more product lines. This interruption of the manufacturing process could impair our ability to fill customers\u2019 orders as they are placed, putting us at a competitive disadvantage. The inability to secure supplies of products that we sell via distribution would also prohibit us from supplying our customers and put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe have a significant amount of raw material and \u201cwork in process\u201d inventory on hand that may not be used in the year ending December 31, 2022 if the expected configuration of sales orders is not received at projected levels.\nWe had approximately $461,000 in raw material components for the manufacture of our products at December 31, 2021. The non-chemical raw material components may be retained and used in production indefinitely and the chemical raw materials components have lives in excess of 20 years. In addition to the raw material inventory, we had approximately $109,000 in \u201cwork in process\u201d (manufactured testing strips) inventory at December 31, 2021. The components for much of this \u201cwork in process\u201d inventory have lives of 12-36 months. If sales orders received are not for products that would utilize the raw material components, or if product developments make the raw materials obsolete, we may be required to dispose of these unused raw materials. In addition, since the components for much of the \u201cwork in process\u201d inventory have lives of 12-36 months, if sales orders within the next 12-36 months are not for products that contain the components of the \u201cwork in process\u201d inventory, we may need to discard this expired \u201cwork in process\u201d inventory. We have established an allowance for obsolete or slow moving inventory. At December 31, 2021, this allowance was $278,000. There can be no assurance that this allowance will continue to be adequate for the year ending December 31, 2022 or that it will not have to be adjusted in the future.\nWe may not be able to hire and retain qualified personnel in several important areas which could negatively impact our growth strategy.\nWe need skilled sales and marketing, technical and production personnel to maintain and/or grow our business. If we fail to retain our present staff or hire additional qualified personnel our business could suffer, specifically in the case of sales personnel. Recently, we have found it to be increasingly difficult to locate and hire individuals that have the experience required to sell toxicology and diagnostic products. An inability to find qualified sales representatives would negatively impact our ability to maintain and/or grow sales.\nWe incur costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nWe incur legal, accounting and other expenses as a result of our required compliance with certain regulations implemented by the SEC. Our executive management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance requirements, including but not limited to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Our management is required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (as a smaller reporting company, we are exempt from the requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring auditor\u2019s attestation related to internal controls over financial reporting). If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404(a), if we identify deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting, or if we are unable to comply with any other SEC regulations or requirements, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nRisks Related to Selling and Marketing\nThe drug testing market is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully against lower cost producers.\nThe market for drug tests used at the point of collection is highly competitive. Several companies produce drug tests that compete directly with our drug test products and they produce their products outside the United State at a significantly +lower cost. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources, allowing them to devote substantially more resources to business and product development and marketing efforts. Our inability to successfully address any competitive risk factors could negatively impact sales and our ability to achieve profitability.\nAny adverse changes in our regulatory framework could negatively impact our business, and costs to obtain regulatory clearance are material.\nAlthough we are unaware of any recent or upcoming changes in regulatory standards related to the marketing of our drug tests, changes in regulatory requirements could negatively impact our business if we are unable to comply with the changes. Typically, the cost to comply with regulatory changes is significant, especially if additional applications for marketing clearance from FDA are required. The cost of filing a 510(k) marketing clearance is material and can have a negative impact on efforts to improve our financial performance. If regulatory standards change in the future, there can be no assurance that we will receive marketing clearances from FDA, if and when we apply for them.\nWe are marketing the Covid-19 tests we are distributing under the FDA EUA policy and each product\u2019s individual EUA issued by FDA. Revocation of individual product\u2019s EUA could negatively impact our business and stop sales of the Covid-19 test(s). In addition, when/if the EUA policy is revoked by FDA (due to a downturn in the pandemic), the Covid-19 tests we are marketing would no longer be able to be sold in the United States since none of the tests we are distributing are 510(k) cleared.\nWe rely on intellectual property rights and contractual non-disclosure obligations to protect our proprietary information (including customer information). These rights and obligations may not adequately protect our proprietary information, and an inability to protect our proprietary information can harm our business.\nWe rely on confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our confidential and proprietary information. Confidential and proprietary information (such as components and product costing, customer pricing structures, customer information, vendor information, internal financial information, production processes, new product developments, product enhancements and other material, non-public information) is protected under non-disclosure agreements with our personnel and consultants. If these individuals do not comply with their obligations under these agreements, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect our confidential information and the use of this information by the breaching individual may cause harm to our business. In fact, until the latter part of Fiscal 2019, we were engaged in litigation with Todd Bailey (\u201cBailey\u201d), a former Vice President, Sales & Marketing/Consultant of the Company. The complaint that we filed against Bailey was related to allegations that Bailey used our confidential and proprietary information to circumvent and interfere with long-standing ABMC customers. This interference resulted in contracts being awarded to Bailey\u2019s company, Premier Biotech Inc., thereby causing harm to our business. We incurred significant legal fees as a result of this litigation and ultimately, the litigation was settled. The terms of the settlement remain confidential.\nWe also rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products, dilute our trademarks, or otherwise infringe upon our rights. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect our intellectual property right under laws of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not ensure that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States or abroad will be adequate. Policing and enforcement against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and other confidential proprietary information could entail significant expenses and could prove difficult or impossible. Such significant expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Securities\nPotential issuance and exercise of new options and warrants and exercise of outstanding options could adversely affect the value of our securities.\nWe currently have two non-statutory stock option plans, the Fiscal 2001 Non-statutory Stock Option Plan (the \u201c2001 Plan\u201d) and the 2013 Equity Compensation Plan (the \u201c2013 Plan\u201d). Both plans have been adopted by our Board of Directors and approved by our shareholders. The shares of common stock underlying the exercise of the stock options under the 2001 Plan have been registered with the SEC making them freely tradeable when/if exercised by the holder; however, the shares underlying the exercise of the stock options under the 2013 Plan have not been registered with the SEC.\nBoth the 2001 Plan and the 2013 Plan have options available for future issuance. As of December 31, 2021, there were 1,937,000 options issued and outstanding under the 2001 Plan. There were no options issued under the 2013 Plan, making the total issued and outstanding options 1,937,000 as of December 31, 2021. Of the total options issued and outstanding, 1,937,000 are fully vested as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, there were 1,780,000 options available for issuance under the 2001 Plan and 4,000,000 options available for issuance under the 2013 Plan. As of December 31, 2021, we had 0 warrants issued and outstanding.\nIf outstanding stock options are exercised, the common stock issued will be freely tradable, increasing the total number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding. If these shares are offered for sale in the public market, the sales could adversely affect the prevailing market price by lowering the bid price of our securities. The exercise of these stock options could also materially impair our ability to raise capital through the future sale of equity securities because issuance of the shares of common stock underlying the stock options would cause further dilution of our securities. In addition, in the event of any change in the outstanding shares of our common stock by reason of any recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization consolidation, combination or exchange of shares, merger or any other changes in our corporate or capital structure or our common stock, the number and class of shares covered by the stock options and/or the exercise price of the stock options may be adjusted as set forth in their plans.\nSubstantial resales of restricted securities may depress the market price of our securities.\nThere are 6,135,986 shares of common stock presently issued and outstanding as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are \u201crestricted securities\u201d as that term is defined under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). These securities may be sold in compliance with Rule 144 of the Securities Act (\u201cRule 144\u201d), or pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act. Rule 144 addresses sales of restricted securities by affiliates and non-affiliates of an issuer. An \u201caffiliate\u201d is a person, such as an officer, director or large shareholder, in a relationship of control with the issuer. \u201cControl\u201d means the power to direct the management and policies of the company in question, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise. If someone buys securities from a controlling person or an affiliate, they take restricted securities, even if they were not restricted in the affiliate's hands.\nA person who is not an affiliate of the issuer (and who has not been for at least three months) and has held the restricted securities for at least one year can sell the securities without regard to restrictions. If the non-affiliate had held the securities for at least six months but less than one year, the securities may be sold by the non-affiliate as long as the current public information condition has been met (i.e. that the issuer has complied with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)).\nWe are subject to reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Under Rule 144, if a holder of securities is an affiliate of an issuer subject to Exchange Act reporting requirements, the securities must be held for at least six months. In addition, the number of equity securities sold during any three-month period cannot exceed 1% of the outstanding shares of the same class being sold. The securities must be sold in unsolicited, routine trading transactions and brokers may not receive more than normal commission. Affiliates must also file a notice with the SEC on Form 144 if a sale involves more than 5,000 shares or the aggregate dollar amount is greater than $50,000 in any three-month period. The sale must take place within three months of filing the Form 144 and, if the securities have not been sold, an amended notice must be filed. Investors should be aware that sales under Rule 144 or pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act might depress the market price of our securities in any market for such shares.\nOur shares are quoted on the OTCQB Venture Market, and are currently subject to SEC \u201cpenny stock,\u201d rules, which could make it more difficult for a broker-dealer to trade our shares of common stock, for an investor to acquire or dispose of our shares in the secondary market and for us to retain or attract market makers.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations that define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange or securities of an issuer in continuous operation for more than three years whose net tangible assets are in excess of $2 million, or an issuer that has average revenue of at least $6 million for the last three years. Our shares of common stock are currently trading on the OTCQB Venture Market. As of Fiscal 2021, our net tangible assets did not exceed $2 million, and our average revenue for the last three years was only $3,340,000, so our securities do not currently qualify for exclusion from the \u201cpenny stock\u201d definitions. Therefore, our shares of common stock are subject to \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. For any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. For these reasons, a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market. Therefore, broker-dealers may be less willing or able to sell or make a market in our securities because of the penny stock disclosure rules. Not maintaining a listing on a major stock market may result in a decrease in the trading price of our securities due to a decrease in liquidity and less interest by institutions and individuals in investing in our securities, and could also make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future. Furthermore, quotation on OTCQB Venture Market may make it more difficult to retain and attract market makers. In the event that market makers cease to function as such, public trading of our securities will be adversely affected or may cease entirely.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nAlthough our common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB Venture Market, the market for our shares has demonstrated varying levels of trading activity. Furthermore, the current level of trading may not be sustained in the future. The lack of an active market for our common stock may impair investors\u2019 ability to sell their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider reasonable, may reduce the fair market value of their shares and may impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock and, accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and limitations under applicable law, and will depend on various factors, including our operating results, financial condition, future prospects and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. You should not rely on an investment in our company if you require dividend income from your investment in our company. The success of your investment will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation of the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value.\nThe sale or issuance of our common stock to Lincoln Park causes dilution and the sale of the shares of common stock acquired by Lincoln Park, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nOn December 9, 2020, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park and on that date we sold 500,000 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park in an initial purchase under the Purchase Agreement for a total purchase price of $125,000. We also issued 1,250,000 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park as consideration for its irrevocable commitment to purchase our common stock under the Purchase Agreement. A Registration Statement on Form S-1 was declared effective by the SEC on January 11, 2021; thereby registering the shares of common stock purchased by Lincoln Park. The Form S-1 registered a total of 9,750,000 shares of common stock. The remaining shares of common stock that may be issued under the Purchase Agreement may be sold by us to Lincoln Park at our discretion from time to time over a 24-month period.\nThe purchase price for the shares that we may sell to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement will fluctuate based on the price of our common stock. Depending on market liquidity at the time, sales of such shares may cause the trading price of our common stock to fall.\nSubject to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we generally have the right to control the timing and amount of any future sales of our shares to Lincoln Park. Additional sales of our common stock, if any, to Lincoln Park will depend upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by us. Through Fiscal 2021, we sold 8,250,000 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park (including the 1,250,000 commitment shares referenced previously) for which we received gross proceeds of $764,000; leaving 1,500,000 unpurchased shares under the Registration Statement and almost $9,500,000 in purchases left under the Purchase Agreement until December 2022.\nIf able, we may decide to sell to Lincoln Park all, some, or none of the additional shares of our common stock that may be available for us to sell pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. If and when we do sell shares to Lincoln Park, after Lincoln Park has acquired the shares, Lincoln Park may resell all or some of those shares at any time or from time to time in its discretion. Therefore, sales to Lincoln Park by us would result in dilution of our common stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park, or the anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nWe may require additional financing to sustain our operations, without which we may not be able to continue operations, and the terms of subsequent financings may adversely impact our stockholders.\nUnder our Purchase Agreement, we may direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to $10,250,000 worth of shares of our common stock over a 24-month period (ending in December 2022); of which almost $9,500,000 is left in purchases. Purchases are generally in amounts up to 200,000 shares of our common stock (such purchases, \u201cRegular Purchases\u201d), which may be increased to up to 250,000 shares or 500,000 shares of our common stock depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of sale.\nThe extent we rely on Lincoln Park as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors including the prevailing market price of our common stock (which, in the latter part of Fiscal 2021 was trading at levels that were too low to request Regular Purchases under the Purchase Agreement), and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources. If obtaining sufficient funding from Lincoln Park were to prove unavailable or prohibitively dilutive, we will need to secure another source of funding in order to satisfy our working capital needs. Depending on the type and the terms of any financing we pursue, stockholders\u2019 rights and the value of their investment in our common stock could be reduced. A financing could involve one or more types of securities including common stock, convertible debt or warrants to acquire common stock. These securities could be issued at or below the then prevailing market price for our common stock. In addition, we currently have secured debt facilities, the holders of which have a claim to our assets that are prior to the rights of stockholders until the debt is paid. Interest on these debt facilities already increases operational costs and negatively impacts operating results. If we have to obtain additional debt facilities, this would further negatively impact operating results. Should the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences could be a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.", "PERMNO": 85671, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "ABMC"}
