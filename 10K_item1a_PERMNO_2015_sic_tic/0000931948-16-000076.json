Set forth below are certain risks faced by the Company. Investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other documents that the Company files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nVolatility in the market price of the metals sold by the Company, and changes in the supply and demand of these metals could reduce profitability.\nBecause the Company\u2019s primary source of revenue is the sale of PGMs, changes in the market price of PGMs will affect the Company's profitability. Many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control influence the market prices of these metals. These factors include global supply and demand, speculative activities, international political and economic developments, currency exchange rates, and production levels and costs in other PGM-producing countries, principally South Africa and Russia.\nA prolonged or significant economic contraction in North America, Europe or in any of several other key regions worldwide can put downward pressure on market prices of PGMs, particularly if demand for PGMs declines in connection with reduced automobile demand and more restricted availability of investment credit. If investors release substantial volumes of PGMs into the market from stockpiles, ETF holdings or otherwise, the increased supply can reduce the prices of palladium and platinum. Changes in currency exchange rates, and particularly the significant weakening of the South African rand or Russian ruble, can reduce relative costs of production and improve the competitive cost position of South African and Russian PGM producers. This in turn could reduce the worldwide competitiveness of the Company\u2019s North American operations and make new PGM investment more attractive in South Africa and Russia.\nETFs for palladium and platinum have been introduced in recent years that enable more investors to participate in the PGM markets, potentially resulting in more metal being held in inventory. The overhang from these significant investment holdings of palladium and platinum makes it more difficult to predict accurately future supply and demand for these metals and may contribute to added PGM price volatility.\nReductions in PGM prices would adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues, profits and cash flows. Protracted periods of low metal prices could significantly reduce revenues and the availability of required development funds to levels that could cause portions of the Company\u2019s ore reserves and production plan to become uneconomical. This could lead to substantial reductions in PGM production or to suspension of mining operations, as well as to impairment of asset values and reductions in the Company\u2019s proven and probable ore reserves. See \u201cBusiness and Properties - Competition: Palladium and Platinum Market\u201d for further explanation of these factors.\nExtended periods of high commodity prices may create economic dislocations that may be destabilizing to PGM supply and demand and ultimately to the broader markets. Periods of high PGM market prices generally are beneficial to the Company\u2019s financial performance. However, strong PGM prices also create economic pressure to identify or create alternate technologies that ultimately could depress future long-term demand for PGMs, and at the same time may incentivize development of otherwise marginal mining properties. See \u201cItem 1A - Risk Factors - Users of PGMs may reduce their consumption and substitute other materials for palladium and platinum\u201d for additional discussion of these risks.\nThe Company may be competitively disadvantaged as primarily a palladium producer with a U.S. dollar-based cost structure.\nThe Company\u2019s products compete in a global marketplace with the products of other primary producers of PGMs and with companies that produce PGMs as a by-product. In many cases, the other primary PGM producers mine ore reserves with a higher ratio of platinum to palladium than the Company, and as a result they normally enjoy higher average realizations per ounce. The Company also competes with mining companies that produce PGMs as a by-product of their primary commodity, principally nickel.\nBecause the Company\u2019s U.S.-based cost structure is denominated in dollars, in periods when the U.S. dollar is relatively strong the Company\u2019s competitors, which have cost structures denominated in other currencies, may still operate profitably, while the Company may not. Furthermore, non-primary producers of PGMs who regard PGMs as a by-product may continue to produce and sell PGMs when prices are low, as PGMs are not their principal commodity. In the past, labor arrangements and local legal or political considerations reportedly have driven competitors to continue operating unprofitable facilities even in the face of negative cash margins.\nThe Company has significant financial obligations.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding aggregate balance sheet indebtedness of approximately $259.6 million (face amount of $336.3 million) and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.29. The Company\u2019s level of indebtedness may, among other things:\n\u2022\nResult in higher interest charges and reduce the Company's net income in future periods;\n\u2022\nLimit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional debt financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nRequire the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows from operations to service its debt, reducing the availability of cash flow for other purposes;\n\u2022\nIncrease the Company\u2019s vulnerability to economic downturns, limit its ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities, and restrict its flexibility to react to changes in market or industry conditions; or\n\u2022\nMake it more difficult to pay its debts.\nThe Company\u2019s credit rating currently is below investment grade and is not expected to achieve investment grade in the immediate future. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to access the financial markets when it so desires nor, if it is able to access the financial markets, that terms and rates offered will be acceptable. As a result of its credit rating and market conditions generally, in the past the Company has on occasion been unable to secure financing on terms acceptable to the Company.\nInterest rates at present are near historic lows, and borrowing costs appear likely to rise in the future in step with any significant improvement in economic conditions. Higher interest rates would increase the Company's cost of borrowing for any new borrowings.\nThe Company does not provide any formal sinking fund for retiring its outstanding long-term debt. Prior to debt coming due, the Company would expect to arrange replacement financing or use internal funds sufficient to retire its maturing debt. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain alternate financing or accumulate sufficient funds internally to meet its repayment obligations as debt comes due in the future. If the Company does not have adequate liquidity available and is unable to fund the timely repayment of its outstanding debt, it would be in default and could be forced to sell assets or seek protection from creditors.\nAchievement of the Company\u2019s production goals is subject to uncertainties.\nBased on the complexity and uncertainty involved in operating underground mines, it is challenging to provide precise production and cost forecasts. The Company cannot be certain that either the Stillwater Mine or the East Boulder Mine will achieve the production forecast, that the projected operating cost levels will be achieved, or that adequate funding will be available from internal and external sources to sustain necessary ongoing development work. Failure to achieve the Company\u2019s production forecast may negatively affect the Company\u2019s revenues, profits and cash flows. As the travel distances underground continue to expand both at depth and laterally, it is likely that operating costs will tend to increase from year to year and profitability will therefore decline unless productivity is increased commensurately. Also, as additional underground infrastructure is constructed, amortization expense may increase unless additional ore reserves are identified. Such increased costs could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company has put in place various operating plans and programs that are intended to reduce or limit increases in production costs at both the Stillwater Mine and the East Boulder Mine; however, there can be no assurance that these plans and programs will be implemented effectively or that they can be sustained. Actual production, cash operating costs and economic returns achieved in the future may differ significantly from those currently estimated or those predicted in future studies and estimates.\nOre reserves estimates are inherently imprecise and may require adjustment in the future; changes in ore grades, mining practices and economic factors could materially affect the Company\u2019s production and reported results.\nOre reserve estimates are necessarily imprecise and depend to some extent on statistical inferences drawn from limited drilling samples, which may prove unreliable or unrepresentative. Reported ore reserves are comprised of a proven component and a probable component. Probable ore reserves estimates are less reliable than estimates of proven ore reserves. See \u201cGlossary\u201d for definitions and \u201cBusiness and Properties - Ore Reserve Determination Methodology\u201d for a discussion of the Company's estimation process for proven and probable ore reserves.\nConversion of probable ore reserves to proven ore reserves is calculated by dividing the actual proven tons converted for a given area by the expected tonnage based on a probable yield expectation for that given area. Actual period-to-period conversion of probable ore reserves to proven ore reserves may result in increases or decreases to the total reported amount of ore reserves. Conversion, an indicator of the success in upgrading probable ore reserves to proven ore reserves, is evaluated annually as described under \u201cBusiness and Properties - Proven and Probable Ore Reserves\u201d. Conversion rates are affected by a number of factors, including geological variability, quantity of tonnage represented by the period drilling, applicable mining methods and changes in safe mining practices, economic considerations and new regulatory requirements.\nThe following table illustrates, for each year\u2019s development program, the actual percent conversion rates of probable ore reserves into proven ore reserves experienced by year from 2005 through 2015:\nOre reserves estimates are expressions of professional judgment based on knowledge, experience and industry practice. The Company cannot be certain that its estimated ore reserves are accurate, and future conversion and production experience could differ materially from such estimates. Should the Company encounter mineralization or formations at any of its mines or projects different from those predicted by drilling, sampling and similar examinations, ore reserve estimates may have to be adjusted and mining plans may have to be altered in a way that might adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations. Declines in the market prices of PGMs may render the mining of some or all of the Company\u2019s ore reserves uneconomic and so reduce ore reserves estimates. The grade of ore may vary significantly from time to time and between the Stillwater Mine and the East Boulder Mine, as with any mining operation. The Company cannot provide assurance that any particular quantity of metal will be recovered from the ore reserves. Moreover, short-term factors relating to the ore reserves, such as the availability of production workplaces, the need for additional development of the ore body or the processing of new or different ore types or grades, may impair the Company\u2019s profitability in any particular accounting period.\nAn extended period of low PGM prices could result in a reduction of ore reserves and potential asset impairment charge.\nLower PGM prices can also affect the economic justification of ore reserves. If the price of PGMs declines to the point that the cost of mining certain reserves outweighs the probable gain upon sale, then such resources may no longer be classified as reserves. In each of the past three years, the Company has engaged Behre Dolbear as third-party independent geological experts to review and provide an opinion on the Company\u2019s year-end ore reserves calculations. The Company performs its ore reserves economic assessment using a twelve-quarter trailing price in order to level out short-term volatility in metals prices, viewing the twelve-quarter trailing average as a reasonable surrogate for long-term future PGM prices over the period when the ore reserves will be mined. Using the Company\u2019s combined twelve-quarter trailing weighted average price for palladium and platinum at December 31, 2015, of approximately $866 per ounce, ($740/oz. for palladium and $1,307/oz. for platinum), the Company\u2019s ore reserves at each mine are projected to generate positive undiscounted cash flows over the life of the ore reserves. Consequently, the Company\u2019s ore reserves were not constrained economically at December 31, 2015.\nHowever, it is important to note that if PGM prices were to fall for an extended period, the trailing twelve-quarter price would gradually decline. Also, underlying inflation and increasing travel distances within the mine exert upward pressure on mining and processing costs, which in a stable or declining pricing environment would reduce operating margins. If the trailing twelve-quarter price falls significantly and / or costs increase for an extended period of time, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s reported proven and probable ore reserves will not be constrained economically in the future.s\nThe Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of its assets may not be recoverable. Were the Company to experience a prolonged period of low PGM prices, the Company could face one or more impairment adjustments to its mining assets. See \"Note 4 - Asset Impairment\u201d to the Company\u2019s 2015 consolidated financial statements for further information.\nThe Company's recycling business segment is dependent on relationships with third-party suppliers and has other credit and operational type risks.\nThe Company sources automotive and industrial catalyst materials from third-parties through both purchase and tolling arrangements. The Company has entered into sourcing arrangements for recycled materials with various suppliers, and it depends on those suppliers to provide catalyst and other industrial sources for recycling. The Company is subject to the suppliers\u2019 compliance with the terms of these arrangements and to their contractual right to terminate or suspend the agreement. Should one or more of these sourcing arrangements be terminated, the Company might be unable to source replacement recyclable materials on terms that are acceptable to the Company. If the Company is unable to source sufficient quantities of recycled materials, the recycling business would become less profitable, and this loss could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. Similarly, these suppliers in turn typically source material from various other third-parties in a competitive market, and there can be no assurance of the suppliers\u2019 continuing ability or willingness to source material on behalf of the Company at current volumes and prices. Any constraint on the suppliers\u2019 ability to source material could reduce the profitability of the Company\u2019s recycling business.\nFrom time to time the Company advances cash to third party brokers and suppliers to support the purchase and collection of spent catalyst materials and other industrial sources. These advances normally are made at the time material is ready for shipment or already in transit to the Company\u2019s facilities. In some cases, the Company has a security interest in the materials that the suppliers have procured but for which the Company has not yet received. The unsecured portion of these advances is fully at risk.\nThe Company regularly advances money to its established recycling suppliers for catalyst material that the Company has physically received and carries in its processing inventories. These advances typically represent some portion of the estimated total value of each shipment until final assays are completed determining the actual PGM content of the shipment. Upon completion of the shipment assays, a final settlement takes place based on the actual value of the shipment. However, pending completion of the assays, the payments are based on the estimated PGM content of each shipment, which could vary significantly from the actual PGM content upon assay. Should the estimated PGM content upon assay significantly exceed the actual PGM content, the Company may be at risk for a portion of the amount advanced. This risk normally is mitigated by the established nature of the business relationship with the supplier and by advancing less than a shipment's estimated total value, but should the supplier be unable to settle such an overpayment or seek protection from creditors, the Company could incur a loss to the extent of any overpayment.\nIn its recycling business, the Company regularly enters into fixed forward sales contracts for metal produced from catalyst recycling, normally making these commitments at the time the catalyst material is purchased. For the Company\u2019s fixed forward sales related to recycling of catalysts, the Company is subject to the customers\u2019 compliance with the terms of the agreements, their ability to terminate or suspend the agreements and their willingness and ability to pay. The loss of any of these agreements or failure of a counterparty to perform could require the Company to sell or purchase the contracted metal in the open market, potentially at a significant loss. The Company\u2019s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, included 42.7% from recycling sales and tolling fees.\nMany of the Company's recycling suppliers are comparatively small businesses with limited assets and relatively little credit capacity. While the Company monitors funds being advanced to such businesses and seeks to limit its exposure to any one supplier, if a problem develops with such a supplier, the Company might not be able to fully recover amounts previously advanced to that supplier.\nVolumes of recycling materials available in the marketplace fluctuate substantially in response to changes in PGM prices. Lower PGM prices normally reduce the volume of recycling material available in the market, resulting in less earnings and cash flow from the recycling segment, and therefore less economic support for the mining operations. Should it become necessary at any point to reduce or suspend operations at the mines, the proportion of processing costs allocated to the recycling segment would increase substantially. Further, the ability to operate the smelter and refinery without significant volumes of mine concentrates and the contained copper and nickel has never been demonstrated and would likely require modification to the processing facilities. There is no assurance that the recycling facilities can operate profitably in the absence of significant mine concentrates, or that capital would be available to complete necessary modifications to the processing facilities.\nUsers of PGMs may reduce their consumption and substitute other materials for palladium and platinum\nHigh PGM prices or pricing volatility may lead users of PGMs to look for other materials to substitute for palladium and platinum or to reduce the quantities of these metals they consume. The automobile, electronics, jewelry and dental industries are the largest consumers of palladium. In varying degrees, demand from each of these applications is sensitive to prices. During periods of high palladium prices in the past, there has been some substitution of other materials for palladium in electronics and dental applications. In some cases this substitution has not reversed when palladium prices returned to more normal levels, resulting in a permanent or prolonged decrease in demand from that industry. High platinum prices likewise tend to reduce demand by driving consumers toward alternative materials. The principal demand for platinum comes from the automobile and chemical industries, which utilize platinum as a catalyst in emissions control systems similar to palladium, and from jewelry makers. Substitution in these industries may increase if PGM market prices rise or if supply becomes unreliable. Significant substitution for any reason, in the absence of alternative uses for PGMs being identified, could result in a material and sustained decrease in the price of PGMs, which would negatively affect the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nHigh PGM prices also tend to drive consumers toward ever more efficient utilization of PGMs. In the past, the development of new flow geometries and substrate configurations has resulted in manufacturers \u201cthrifting down\u201d the amount of PGMs in catalytic converters required to meet specific emission standards. From time to time, various researchers have announced technological innovations that if realized could significantly reduce the volume of PGMs required in each catalytic converter. Such emerging applications could tend to drive down PGM demand in the future and result in lower PGM prices, as well as reducing the volume of material available for recycling at the end of a catalytic converter\u2019s useful life.\nTo the extent existing and future environmental regulations or fundamental technological change in the auto industry tend to create disincentives for the use of internal combustion engines, demand for palladium and platinum in automotive catalytic converters could be reduced. Small engines in general tend to have smaller catalytic converters and require less PGMs than those used with larger engines. Less demand for PGMs as a result of these trends could drive down PGM prices and could impair the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe Company\u2019s mining activities are subject to risks that may not be covered by insurance.\nUnderground mining and milling, smelting and refining operations involve a number of risks and hazards, including:\n\u2022\nunusual and unexpected rock formations affecting ore or wall rock characteristics;\n\u2022\nground or slope failures;\n\u2022\ncave-ins, ground water influx, rock bursts and other mining or ground-related problems;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards;\n\u2022\nindustrial accidents;\n\u2022\norganized labor disputes or work slow-downs;\n\u2022\nmetallurgical and other processing, smelting or refining problems;\n\u2022\nwild fires, flooding and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions or other acts of God;\n\u2022\nmechanical equipment failure and facility performance problems; and\n\u2022\navailability and cost of critical materials, power, equipment and skilled manpower.\nSuch risks could result in damage to or destruction of mining assets or production facilities, personal injuries or death, environmental damage, delays in mining or processing, monetary losses and possible legal liability. Some fatal accidents and other non-fatal serious injuries have occurred at the Company\u2019s mines since operations began in 1986. Future industrial accidents or occupational disease occurrences could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and operations. The Company cannot be certain that its insurance will cover certain risks associated with mining or that it will be able to maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums. The Company might also become subject to liability for environmental damage or other hazards which may be uninsurable or for which it may elect not to insure because of high premium costs or commercial impracticality. Such events could result in a prolonged interruption in operations that would have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenues, profits, and cash flows.\nThe Company's sales arrangements concentrate all of the Company's final refining activity and a large portion of its PGM sales from mine production with one entity.\nUnder the terms of the Company\u2019s agreements with JM, the Company utilizes JM for all of its precious metals refining services. In addition, with the exception of certain pre-existing platinum sales commitments to Tiffany & Co., all of the Company\u2019s current mined palladium and platinum is committed for sale to JM. Approximately 57.2% of the Company\u2019s total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, were derived from mine production. Separately, JM has the right to bid on any recycling PGM ounces the Company has available.\nThis significant concentration of business with JM could leave the Company without precious metal refining services should JM experience significant financial or operating difficulties during the contract period. Under such circumstances, it is not clear that sufficient alternate processing capacity would be available to cover the Company\u2019s requirements, nor that the terms of any such alternate processing arrangements as might be available would be financially acceptable to the Company. Any such disruption in refining services would have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenues, profits, and cash flows.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s properties are subject to title risk, particularly related to the validity of unpatented mining claims.\nMontana\nThe Company's Montana properties include a number of unpatented mining and mill site claims. See \u201cBusiness and Properties - Title and Royalties.\u201d The validity of unpatented mining claims on public lands is often uncertain, and possessory rights of claimants may be subject to challenge. The rights to use such claims are granted under the Mining Law of 1872. Unpatented mining claims may be located on lands open to appropriation of mineral rights and are generally considered to be subject to greater title risk than other real property interests because the validity of unpatented mining claims is often uncertain and vulnerable to challenges by third-parties or the federal government. This uncertainty arises, in part, out of the complex federal and state laws and regulations under the 1872 Mining Law and the interaction of the 1872 Mining Law with other federal and state laws, such as those enacted for the protection of the environment. Maintaining the validity of an unpatented mining or mill site claim requires strict compliance with this complex body of federal and state statutory and decisional law and, for unpatented mining claims (as opposed to mill sites), the existence of a discovery of valuable minerals. In addition, few public records exist to definitively control the issues of validity and ownership of unpatented mining claims or mill sites.\nThe Company pays annual maintenance fees and has obtained mineral title reports and legal opinions for some of the unpatented mining claims or mill sites making up portions of its properties, in accordance with applicable laws and what the Company believes is standard industry practice. However, the Company cannot be certain that applicable laws will not be changed nor that the Company\u2019s possessory rights to any of its unpatented claims may not be deemed defective and challenged. In particular, Members of the U.S. Congress have repeatedly introduced bills which would supplant or alter the provisions of the Mining Law of 1872. If adopted, such legislation could, among other things:\n\u2022\nImpose a royalty on the production of metals or minerals from unpatented mining claims;\n\u2022\nReduce or prohibit the ability of a mining company to expand its operations; and\n\u2022\nRequire a material change in the method of exploiting the ore reserves located on unpatented mining claims.\nAs a result, any such legislation could change the cost of holding unpatented mining claims and could significantly affect the Company\u2019s ability to develop ore reserves located on unpatented mining claims. All of the foregoing could adversely affect the economic and financial viability of future mining operations at the Company\u2019s Montana mines. Although it is impossible to predict at this point what any legislated royalties might be, enactment could adversely affect the potential for development of such federal unpatented mining claims.\nCanada\nIn Canada, paramount title to minerals typically vests in the Crown, subject only to any standing claims of Aboriginal title, while the various Ministries of the Provinces enjoy legislative powers to administer the disposition of minerals within their jurisdiction. In Ontario, mining claims grant the claimant conditional rights of access for exploration of hard rock minerals conducted in compliance with regulations regarding surface disturbance, environmental stewardship and annual expenditures to maintain the validity of the claims. New regulations began taking effect in Ontario in November 2012 providing, among other requirements, additional Aboriginal consultation and environmental protection in conjunction with new exploration activities. Mining claims in Ontario do not authorize removal of minerals for other than test work and analyses. To commercially extract minerals, a mining lease is necessary. Crown mining leases provide the claimant with a preference right to develop and extract minerals for a (renewable) 21-year term, under more specific conditions of Aboriginal consultation, environmental protection, approved closure / reclamation plans and financial assurances provided to the Crown over the life of the project. While the Company believes that its mining claims and crown leases provide adequate security of mineral and surface tenure to sustain its mineral exploration activities in the Marathon region of Ontario, there can be no assurance that this tenure will not be challenged in the future nor that all necessary mining leases will ultimately be issued.\nThe Company holds mining claims and crown leases covering the more prospective portions of the Port Coldwell Intrusive Complex. The Company\u2019s aggregate property holdings in the Coldwell Complex include 43 crown leases and 82 mining claims comprised of 830 claim units. Thirty-six of the leases grant both surface and mineral rights while five of the leases presently grant mineral rights, two leases grant surface rights only. Applications have been submitted for surface leases on the five mineral leases as well as for both mineral and surface crown leases on certain additional property currently held by the Company under valid mining claims. There can be no assurance that these surface leases will be forthcoming.\nArgentina\nThe Company holds a 100% interest in nine mining concessions and holds options on five other mining concessions associated with the Altar project in Argentina. Several of these concessions require that the Company make periodic option payments, meet minimum exploration expenditure commitments, or both. All concessions require periodic mining concession fees. Failure to meet these minimum obligations could result in the forfeiture of such concessions. Future mining on these properties will require securing mining permits and obtaining control of surface rights on these properties. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to secure these permits or acquire the surface rights on acceptable terms.\nThe Company\u2019s operation of ore concentration, smelting and refining facilities subjects it to operating and environmental risks.\nThe Company\u2019s processing facilities include concentrators at each mine site that grind produced ore and extract the contained metal sulfides, and a smelter and base metal refinery located in Columbus, Montana. While the environmental and safety performance of these facilities to date has been in material compliance with all applicable laws, there can be no assurance that incidents such as solution spills, sulfur dioxide discharges, explosions or accidents involving hot metals and product spills in transportation will not occur in the future. Such incidents potentially could result in losses or claims for damages being brought against the Company, more stringent environmental or operating restrictions on these facilities and additional expenses to the Company, which could negatively affect its results of operations and cash flows. Further, the Company processes virtually all its metals through these processing facilities, and any incident interrupting processing operations for an extended period would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s performance.\nThe Company is required to obtain and renew governmental permits in order to conduct operations, a process which is often costly and time-consuming.\nIn the normal course of its business, the Company is required to obtain and renew governmental permits for exploration, operations and expansion of existing operations and for the development of new projects. Obtaining and renewing governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process, especially where federal agency analysis and review of the potential environmental impact is required under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), by the USFS or the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The timeliness and success of permitting efforts are contingent upon many variables not within the Company's control, including the interpretation of permit approval requirements administered by the applicable permitting authority. The Company may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to its operations or the cost and time required to obtain or renew permits may exceed the Company's expectations. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the permitting process could delay the development or impede the operation of a mine, which in turn could materially adversely affect the Company's revenues and future growth.\nCompliance with current and future statutes and regulations could affect production, increase costs and cause delays.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental controls and regulations, including regulations associated with the implementation of the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Metals Mines Reclamation Act and numerous permit stipulations as documented in the Record of Decision for each operating entity, including those relating to the protection of threatened and endangered species under the Endangered Species Act. Properties controlled by the Company in Canada and Argentina are subject to analogous federal and provincial controls and regulations in those respective countries. The body of environmental laws is continually changing and, as a general matter, is becoming more restrictive. Compliance with these regulations requires the Company to obtain permits issued by federal, state, provincial and local regulatory agencies. Failure to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permitting requirements, whether now or in the future, may result in enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities, causing operations to cease or to be curtailed, and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions. Non-renewal of permits, the inability to secure new permits, or the imposition of additional conditions could eliminate or severely restrict the Company\u2019s ability to conduct its operations. See \u201cBusiness and Properties - Regulatory and Environmental Matters.\u201d\nThe Company\u2019s existing mining operations are located adjacent to the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness Area and are situated approximately 30 miles from the northern boundary of Yellowstone National Park. While the Company works closely and cooperatively with local environmental organizations, the Montana DEQ and the USFS, there can be no assurance that future political or regulatory efforts will not further restrict or seek to terminate the Company\u2019s operations in this sensitive area. In addition, environmental hazards or damage may exist on mineral properties held by the Company that were caused by previous owners or operators or that may have occurred naturally, and that are unknown to the Company at the present time. In some cases, the Company could be required to remedy such damage.\nMining activities also are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety, including mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are substantial. The Company employs various measures in its operating facilities in an effort to protect the health and safety of the Company\u2019s workforce. Underground mines in the U.S., including the Stillwater and East Boulder mines, are continuously inspected by MSHA, which inspections often lead to notices of violation. Any of the Company's U.S. mines could be subject to a temporary or extended shut down as a result of a violation alleged by MSHA. Possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of operations and delays in the development of new properties.\nThe Company is required to post and maintain surety for its reclamation obligations, which are substantial. At December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding $40.1 million of environmental surety bonds. Such reclamation obligations generally increase over time as costs rise and the physical extent of mining operations expands. Failure to secure and maintain adequate surety coverage could result in the Company's operating permits being revoked and mining operations terminated.\nParties engaged in mining operations or in the exploration or development of mineral properties may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may be subject to civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Any such costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations.\nLitigation and regulatory proceedings may affect the revenues, profits and cash flows of the Company.\nThe Company may be subject to civil claims (including class action claims) based on allegations of negligence, breach of statutory duty, public nuisance or private nuisance or otherwise in connection with its operations or investigations relating thereto. While the Company is presently unable to quantify its potential liability under any of the above, such liability may be material to the Company and may have a material adverse effect on its ability to continue in operation.\nIn addition, the Company may be subject to actions or related investigations by governmental or regulatory authorities. Such actions may include civil or criminal prosecution for breach of relevant statues, regulations or rules or failure to comply with the terms of the Company's licenses and permits and may result in liability for pollution, other fines or penalties, revocation of consents, permits, approvals or licenses or similar action, which could be material and may affect the Company's results of operations. Exposures to fines and penalties generally are uninsurable as a matter of public policy.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions; income tax structures are subject to changes that could increase the Company\u2019s effective tax rate.\nIn the U.S., the Company enjoys certain beneficial tax provisions afforded to natural resource companies that have the effect of reducing the Company\u2019s overall effective tax rate. Preliminary discussions in the U.S. Congress with regard to restructuring the corporate income tax include consideration of reducing or eliminating some or all of these preferential benefits. The revenue needs of state and local jurisdictions may lead to revisions in tax structures or nexus considerations that may adversely affect the Company. While it is not possible at this time to predict the direction such changes might ultimately take, if such changes were enacted they could increase the effective tax rate paid by the Company for federal and state income taxes.\nThe Company's foreign assets subject the Company to additional risks.\nThrough its ownership of Marathon and Peregrine, which represent significant resource properties in Canada and Argentina, respectively, the Company is subject to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions outside of the United States. These risks include without limitation:\n\u2022\nThe effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of the revenues, profits and cash flows the Company receives from non-U.S. markets or its assets in non-U.S. countries, or increase the Company\u2019s costs, as measured in U.S. dollars in those markets;\n\u2022\nPolitical or economic instability, social or labor unrest or changing macroeconomic conditions or other changes in political, economic or social conditions in the respective jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nDifferent legal and regulatory structures (including creditor rights that may be different than in the United States) and unexpected changes in regulatory environments, including changes resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or imposition of onerous trade restrictions or barriers, price and currency controls, industry constraints, employee welfare schemes or other government regulations;\n\u2022\nIncreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; and\n\u2022\nDisruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s management has limited experience managing foreign operations, and may be required to devote significant time and resources to adapting its systems, policies and procedures in order to successfully manage the integration and operation of foreign assets.\nCapital costs for new mine developments are difficult to estimate and may change over time.\nThe Company may from time to time become involved in various exploration and development activities, some of which may require substantial future capital and resource commitments to bring into production. The Company normally performs engineering studies before committing to such projects, which studies include a detailed review of the project design and anticipated costs to construct and operate the proposed facilities. Experience in the mining industry has demonstrated that as a project progresses, various factors may cause the initial estimates of such costs to escalate, sometimes significantly. Examples of these factors include unforeseen construction delays, background inflation, lack of timely availability of contractors or required equipment, labor unrest, political and environmental obstacles, late changes to the project design, and so forth. There is no assurance that the Company's projects will not experience such cost escalation as they advance, which could impair the economics of these projects, require additional funding that might not be available or might be costly to secure, and could weaken the Company's financial position.\nLimited availability of skilled mining and management personnel may affect the Company\u2019s ability to achieve its production targets.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate skilled professional employees. Achieving this objective may be difficult at times due to a variety of factors, including fluctuations in the global economic and industry conditions, competitors' hiring practices, cost reduction activities, and the effectiveness of compensation programs. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense and the pool of fully qualified candidates is limited. The Company must continue to recruit, retain, and motivate its management, miners and other key personnel in order to maintain its business and support its projects. A loss of key management or other personnel could prevent the Company from capitalizing on business opportunities, and its operating results could be adversely affected.\nUnion represented labor creates an increased risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs.\nThe Company had a total of 1,439 employees at December 31, 2015. Of these, 804 employees located at the Stillwater Mine and the Columbus processing facilities are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the USW Local 11-0001, which expires June 2, 2019 with a limited re-negotiation (for wages only) in 2017. At December 31, 2015, a total of 321 employees at the East Boulder Mine were covered by a separate collective bargaining agreement with USW Local 11-0001, which expires December 31, 2019 with a limited re-negotiation i(for wages only) n 2017. As a majority of the Company\u2019s workforce is unionized, the Company is subject to a risk of strikes and other labor disputes like the Company experienced in 2015, and its ability to alter labor costs is restricted by the fact that unionized employees are party to collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis, and the risk exists that such agreements may not be renewed on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Company or at all. The Company cannot predict what issues may be raised by the unions representing its unionized employees and, if raised, whether negotiations concerning those issues will be concluded successfully. While the Company recently renegotiated these labor contracts and focuses on maintaining positive relationships with its represented employees and their respective unions, any future labor disputes or disruptions, such as strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns, could have a significant adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company is dependent on information technology and its systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks.\nThe Company utilizes a variety of information technology systems and infrastructure. Any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction or interruption of these systems by employees, others with authorized access to the systems, or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. There is also a risk that the Company could experience a business interruption, theft of information, or reputational damage as a result of a cyber-attack, such as an infiltration of a data center, or data leakage of confidential information either internally or by third-party providers. While the Company has invested in the protection of its data and information technology to reduce these risks and periodically tests the security of its information systems network, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in the Company's systems that could adversely affect its business.\nThe Company's information technology and infrastructure is based on specific platforms and architectures that to some extent are dependent on third-party maintenance and support. The Company is required to regularly update many of its key systems to ensure that the suppliers of those systems will continue to support and maintain them. If support for one or more of the Company's critical information technology systems were to be withdrawn, the Company's activities that depend on those systems could be at risk.\nCertain participants in the Company\u2019s 401(k) plan may have rescission rights with respect to shares of the Company\u2019s common stock purchased by such participants.\nIn October 2015, the Company learned that transactions in Stillwater Common Stock in the Stillwater Mining Company 401(k) Plan and the Stillwater Mining Company Bargaining Unit 401(k) Plan (together, the \u201c401(k) Plans\u201d) may have exceeded the number of shares the Company had registered with the SEC on Form S-8 for such transactions and may not have qualified for an available exemption from registration requirements. Transactions in Stillwater Common Stock in the 401(k) Plans include: (i) initial investment of salary reduction contributions from employees, (ii) fixed matching source funds from Stillwater and (iii) intra-plan transfers of funds by participants out of other investments into Stillwater Common Stock. In addition, the Company inadvertently failed to deliver certain disclosures required to be delivered to participants in its 401(k) Plans. Effective October 1, 2015, the Company has frozen Stillwater Common Stock as an investment option under the 401(k) Plans, and eliminated it as a means of funding the employer matching contribution under the 401(k) Plans.\nFederal securities laws generally provide for a one-year rescission right for an investor who acquires unregistered securities in a transaction that is subject to registration and for which no exemption was available. As such, an investor successfully asserting a rescission right during the one-year time period has the right to require an issuer to repurchase the securities acquired by the investor at the price paid by the investor for the securities (or if such security has been disposed of, to receive damages with respect to any loss on such disposition), plus interest from the date of acquisition. These rights may apply to certain participants in the 401(k) Plans and the Company may incur liability to participants in the 401(k) Plans. Based on the Company\u2019s current stock price, the Company believes that its current potential liability for rescission claims is not material to the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows; however, the Company\u2019s potential liability could become material in the future if the Company\u2019s stock price were to fall significantly during the one-year period following the unregistered acquisitions. The Company is currently exploring various options to limit this potential liability.", "PERMNO": 81173, "SIC": 1090, "TIC": "SWC"}
