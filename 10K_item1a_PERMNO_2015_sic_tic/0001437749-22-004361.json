{"cik": "743238", "company": "SHYFT GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nOur financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within our control that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. The risks described below are the primary risks known to us that we believe could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, these risks may not be the only risks we face. Our business could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us, factors we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations, or factors that emerge as new risks in the future.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur results of operations are likely to continue to be adversely affected by the circumstances relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe have experienced challenges to our business arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental directives, and we expect to continue facing these challenges for the foreseeable future. In 2020, we were forced to shut down certain of our facilities, often on short notice. Although all of our facilities are currently in operation, future shutdowns are possible as long as the COVID-19 virus presents a public health risk.\nIn addition, we have had to incur additional costs and expenses to maintain our facilities and operations in compliance with governmental directives and in a manner designed to protect the health and safety of our workforce. These challenges are made more difficult by the fact that we have facilities in multiple states, and each state has implemented different restrictions and directives in response to the pandemic. This also increases our compliance-related risk as we work to understand and comply with the different rules and regulations within each state.\nWe have also experienced increased employee absences related to the pandemic, due to illness and/or the need to care for family members. This challenge may continue throughout 2022.\nThese challenges also impact our suppliers, and we have experienced supply chain disruptions as a result. Our inability to obtain raw materials, chassis and other supplies on a timely basis negatively impacts our ability to fulfill customer orders, which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Our Company and Business\nAny negative change in our relationship with our major customers could have significant adverse effects on revenues and profits.\nOur financial success is directly related to the willingness of our customers to continue to purchase our products. Failure to fill customers\u2019 orders in a timely manner or on the terms and conditions they may impose could harm our relationships with our customers. The importance of maintaining excellent relationships with our major customers may also give these customers leverage in our negotiations with them, including pricing and other supply terms, as well as post-sale disputes. This leverage may lead to increased costs to us or decreased margins. Furthermore, if any of our major customers experience a significant downturn in their business or fail to remain committed to our products or brands, then these customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from us, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In 2021, we had a single customer that accounted for 25.1 percent of consolidated sales. Sales to our top 10 customers accounted for 60.6 percent of our sales.\nWe may not be able to remain competitive in the rapidly changing markets in which we compete.\nThe markets we serve are undergoing rapid transformation, particularly with respect to parcel delivery services and electric vehicle (EV) technologies. Our competitors include companies that have significantly greater resources than we do, including OEMs and certain of our customers, and which are highly motivated by market opportunities to deploy those resources. In addition to these established, mature competitors, we also face competition from new market entrants, including technology companies. As a result of these market opportunities, OEMs and other companies have taken actions to reduce costs, including through in-sourcing and supply base consolidation. We expect these trends to continue and even accelerate. Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to adequately respond to these pressures or otherwise continue to compete in these markets.\nThe integration of businesses or assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future involves challenges that could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have pursued and expect we will continue to selectively pursue acquisitions of businesses or assets in order to diversify, expand our capabilities, enter new markets, or increase our market share. Integrating any newly acquired business or assets can be expensive and can require a great deal of management time and other resources. If we are unable to successfully integrate the newly acquired businesses with our existing business, we may not realize the synergies we expect from the acquisition and our business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nRe-configuration or relocation of our production operations could negatively impact our earnings.\nWe may, from time to time, reconfigure our production lines or relocate production of products between buildings or locations or to new locations to maximize the efficient utilization of our existing production capacity or take advantage of opportunities to increase manufacturing efficiencies. Costs incurred to affect these reconfigurations or relocations may exceed our estimates, and efficiencies gained may be less than anticipated, each of which may have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nDisruptions within our dealer network could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely, for certain of our products, on a network of independent dealers to market, deliver, provide training for, and service our products to and for customers. Our business is influenced by our ability to initiate and manage new and existing relationships with dealers.\nFrom time to time, we or an individual dealer may choose to terminate the relationship, or the dealership could face financial difficulty leading to failure or difficulty in transitioning to new ownership. In addition, our competitors could engage in a strategy to attempt to acquire or convert our dealers to carry their products. We do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer, the loss of which would have a sustained material adverse effect upon our business.\nHowever, disruption of dealer coverage within a specific local market could have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market. The loss or termination of a significant number of dealers could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. In the event that a dealer in a strategic market experiences financial difficulty, we may choose to provide financial support such as extending credit to a dealership, reducing the risk of disruption, but increasing our financial exposure.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement and manage our growth strategy.\nOur growth strategy includes expanding existing market share through product innovation, continued expansion into industrial and global markets and merger or acquisition related activities. We believe our future success depends in part on our research and development and engineering efforts, our ability to manufacture or source the products and customer acceptance of our products. As it relates to new markets, our success also depends on our ability to create and implement local supply chain, sales and distribution strategies to reach these markets.\nThe potential inability to successfully implement and manage our growth strategy could adversely affect our business and our results of operations. The successful implementation of our growth strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate operations with acquired companies.\nOur efforts to grow our business in emerging markets are subject to all of these risks plus additional, unique risks. In certain markets, the legal and political environment can be unstable and uncertain which could make it difficult for us to compete successfully and could expose us to liabilities.\nWe also make investments in new business development initiatives which could have a relatively high failure rate. We limit our investments in these initiatives and establish governance procedures to contain the associated risks, but losses could result and may be material. Our growth strategy also may involve acquisitions, joint venture alliances and additional arrangements of distribution. We may not be able to enter into acquisitions or joint venture arrangements on acceptable terms, and we may not successfully integrate these activities into our operations. We also may not be successful in implementing new distribution channels, and changes could create discord in our existing channels of distribution.\nIncreased costs, including costs of raw materials, component parts and labor costs, potentially impacted by changes in labor rates and practices and/or new or increased tariffs or similar restrictions, could reduce our operating income.\nOur results of operations may be significantly affected by the availability and pricing of manufacturing components and labor, changes in labor rates and practices, and increases in tariffs or similar restrictions on materials we import. Increases in costs of raw materials used in our products could affect the cost of our supply materials and components, as rising steel and aluminum prices as well as increased tariffs have impacted the cost of certain of our manufacturing components. Although we attempt to mitigate the effect of any escalation in components, labor costs, and tariffs by negotiating with current or new suppliers and by increasing productivity or, where possible, by increasing the sales prices of our products, we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so without it having an adverse impact on the competitiveness of our products and, therefore, our sales volume. If we cannot successfully offset increases in our manufacturing costs, this could have a material adverse impact on our margins, operating income and cash flows. Our profit margins may decrease if prices of purchased component parts, labor rates, and/or tariffs increase, and we are unable to pass on those increases to our customers.\nImplementing new information systems could interfere with our business or operations.\nWe are in the process of implementing new information systems infrastructure and applications that impact multiple locations. These projects require significant investment of capital and human resources, the re-engineering of many processes of our business, and the attention of many employees and managers who would otherwise be focused on other aspects of our business. Should the systems not be implemented successfully, we may incur impairment charges that could materially impact our financial results. If the systems do not perform in a satisfactory manner once implementation is complete, our business and operations could be disrupted and our results of operations negatively affected, including our ability to report accurate and timely financial results.\nDisruption of our supply base could affect our ability to obtain component parts.\nWe increasingly rely on component parts from global sources in order to manufacture our products. Disruption of this supply base due to international political events, natural disasters, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors could affect our ability to obtain component parts at acceptable prices, or at all, and have a negative impact on our sales, results of operations and financial position.\nWhen we introduce new products, we may incur expenses that we did not anticipate, such as recall expenses, resulting in reduced earnings.\nThe introduction of new products is critical to our future success. We have additional costs when we introduce new products, such as initial labor or purchasing inefficiencies, but we may also incur unexpected expenses. For example, we may experience unexpected engineering or design issues that will force a recall of a new product or increase production costs of the product above levels needed to ensure profitability. In addition, we may make business decisions that include offering incentives to stimulate the sales of products not adequately accepted by the market, or to stimulate sales of older or less marketable products. The costs resulting from these types of problems could be substantial and have a significant adverse effect on our earnings.\nWe depend on a small group of suppliers for some of our components, and the loss of any of these suppliers could affect our ability to obtain components at competitive prices, which would decrease our sales or earnings.\nMost chassis and specialty vehicle commodity components are readily available from a variety of sources. However, a few proprietary or specialty components are produced by a small group of suppliers.\nIn addition, we generally do not purchase chassis for our delivery vehicles. Rather, we accept shipments of vehicle chassis owned by dealers or end-users for the purpose of installing and/or manufacturing our specialized truck bodies on such chassis. There are four primary sources for commercial chassis, and we have established relationships with all major chassis manufacturers.\nChanges in our relationships with these suppliers, shortages, production delays, their ability to secure components required for chassis production or work stoppages by the employees of such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely manufacture our products and secure sales. If we cannot obtain an adequate supply of components or commercial chassis, this could result in a decrease in our sales and earnings.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the decision of our employees to unionize.\nCurrently, none of our U.S. employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. If in the future our employees decide to unionize, this would increase our operating costs and potentially force us to alter the way we operate causing an adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe ability to hire or retain management and other key personnel is critical to our continued success, and the loss of or inability to hire such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. As all key personnel devote their full time to our business, the loss of any member of our management team, or other key persons, or the inability to hire key persons, could have an adverse effect on us. If we lose key members of our senior management team or are unable to effect successful transitions from one executive to another as part of our succession plan, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks associated with international sales and contracts could have a negative effect on our business.\nIn 2021, 2020, and 2019, we derived 1.2%, 1.4%, and 2.8% of our revenue from sales to, or related to, end customers outside the United States. We face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations, any of which could negatively affect our financial performance, including changes in foreign country regulatory requirements, the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies, import/export restrictions, the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers and disruptions in the shipping of exported products.\nAdditionally, as a U.S. corporation, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations.\nChanges in the method of determining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate, may adversely affect interest charged on our outstanding debt.\nThe interest rate charged on our outstanding borrowings pursuant to our credit facility is currently based on LIBOR, as described in \"Note 13 - Debt\" below. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. announced that it would phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. On November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (ICE) announced plans to delay the phase out of LIBOR to June 30, 2023. The U.S. Federal Reserve is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index called the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (SOFR), a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. Our credit facility provides for the transition to a replacement for LIBOR, and it also provides for an alternative to LIBOR. When LIBOR ceases to exist, our interest expense may increase. It is also possible that the overall financing market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR with SOFR or any other reference rate. Increased interest expense and/or disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nMore General Risks Applicable to Our Industry\nGeneral economic, market, and/or political conditions, whether on a global, national, or more regional scale, could have a negative effect on our business.\nConcerns regarding acts of terrorism, armed conflicts, natural disasters, budget shortfalls, cyber events, civil unrest, governmental actions, and epidemics have in the past and could in the future create significant uncertainties that may have material and adverse effects on consumer demand (particularly the specialty and motorhome markets), shipping and transportation, the availability of manufacturing components, commodity prices and our ability to engage in overseas markets as tariffs are implemented. An economic recession, whether resulting from one of these events or others, would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf there is a rise in the frequency and size of product liability, warranty and other claims against us, including wrongful death claims, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe are frequently subject, in the ordinary course of business, to litigation involving product liability and other claims, including wrongful death claims, related to personal injury and warranties. We insure our product liability claims in the commercial insurance market. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claims against us. Any increase in the frequency and size of these claims, as compared to our experience in prior years, may cause the premiums that we are required to pay for such insurance to rise significantly. It may also increase the amounts we pay in punitive damages, which may not be covered by our insurance. In addition, a major product recall or increased levels of warranty claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges to laws and regulations governing our business could have a material impact on our operations.\nOur manufactured products and the industries in which we operate are subject to extensive federal and state regulations. Changes to any of these regulations or the implementation of new regulations could significantly increase the costs of manufacturing, purchasing, operating or selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines, potential civil and criminal liability, suspension of sales or production, or cessation of operations.\nCertain U.S. tax laws currently afford favorable tax treatment for financing the purchase of recreational vehicles that are used as the equivalent of second homes. These laws and regulations have historically been amended frequently, and it is likely that further amendments and additional regulations will be applicable to us and our products in the future. Amendments to these laws and regulations and the implementation of new regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal and state environmental regulations relating to noise pollution and the use, generation, storage, treatment, emission and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines, potential civil and criminal liability, suspension of production or operations, alterations to the manufacturing process, costly cleanup or capital expenditures. Climate change regulations at the federal, state or local level could require us to change our manufacturing processes or product portfolio or undertake other activities that may require us to incur additional expense, which may be material.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarter-to-quarter basis.\nOur quarterly operating results depend on a variety of factors including the timing and volume of orders, the completion of product inspections and acceptance by our customers, and various restructuring initiatives that may be undertaken from time to time. In addition, our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment experiences seasonality whereby product shipments in the first and fourth quarters are generally lower than other quarters as a result of the busy holiday delivery operations experienced by some of its largest customers. Accordingly, our financial results may be subject to significant and/or unanticipated quarter-to-quarter fluctuations.\nOur businesses are cyclical, and this can lead to fluctuations in our operating results.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly cyclical and there can be substantial fluctuations in our manufacturing, shipments and operating results, and the results for any prior period may not be indicative of results for any future period. Companies within these industries are subject to volatility in operating results due to external factors such as economic, demographic and political changes. Factors affecting the manufacture of chassis, specialty vehicles, delivery vehicles and other of our products include but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nCommodity prices;\n\u25cf\nFuel availability and prices.\n\u25cf\nUnemployment trends;\n\u25cf\nInternational tensions and hostilities;\n\u25cf\nGeneral economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nVarious tax incentives;\n\u25cf\nStrength of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies;\n\u25cf\nOverall consumer confidence and the level of discretionary consumer spending;\n\u25cf\nDealers\u2019 and manufacturers\u2019 inventory levels; and\n\u25cf\nInterest rates and the availability of financing.\nEconomic, legal and other factors could impact our customers\u2019 ability to pay accounts receivable balances due from them.\nIn the ordinary course of business, customers are granted terms related to the sale of goods and services delivered to them. These terms typically include a period between when the goods and services are tendered for delivery to the customer and when the customer needs to pay for these goods and services. The amounts due under these payment terms are listed as accounts receivable on our balance sheet. Prior to collection of these accounts receivable, our customers could encounter drops in sales, unexpected increases in expenses, or other factors which could impact their ability to continue as a going concern and which could affect the collectability of these amounts. Writing off uncollectible accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flow as we have major customers with material accounts receivable balances at any given time.\nOur business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or experience a security breach.\nWe rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, product engineering, manufacturing, accounting and other business processes. If these systems are damaged, cease to function properly or are subject to a cyber-security breach such as ransomware, phishing, infection with viruses or intentional attacks aimed at theft or destruction of sensitive data, we may suffer an interruption in our ability to manage and operate the business, and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nLike most corporations, our information systems are a target of attacks. In addition, third-party providers of data hosting or cloud services, as well as our suppliers, may experience cyber-security incidents that may involve data we share with them. There can be no assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future. In order to address risks to our information systems, we continue to make investments in personnel, technologies and training of personnel.\nFuel shortages, or higher prices for fuel, could have a negative effect on sales.\nGasoline or diesel fuel is required for the operation of the specialty vehicles we manufacture. There can be no assurance that the supply of these petroleum products will continue uninterrupted, that rationing will not be imposed or that the price of or tax on these petroleum products will not significantly increase in the future. Increases in gasoline and diesel prices and speculation about potential fuel shortages have had an unfavorable effect on consumer demand for motor homes from time to time in the past and may continue to do so in the future. This, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our sales volume. Increases in the price of oil also can result in significant increases in the price of many of the components in our products, which may have an adverse impact on margins or sales volumes.\nWe could incur asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. At least annually, we review goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets for impairment. Identifiable intangible assets, goodwill and other long-lived assets are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows. If the operating performance at one or more of our reporting units fails to meet future forecasts, or if future cash flow estimates decline, we could be required, under current U.S. accounting rules, to record impairment charges for our goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets. Any write-off of a material portion of such assets could negatively affect our results of operations or financial position. See \u201cNote 2 - Discontinued Operations\u201d and \u201cNote 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets.\nRisk Applicable to Our Securities\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile, which may result in losses to our shareholders.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, quarterly fluctuations in operating results, a failure to meet published estimates of or changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts, sales of common stock by existing stockholders, loss of key personnel, market conditions in our industries, shortages of key product inventory components and general economic conditions.", "PERMNO": 71985, "SIC": 3711, "TIC": "SHYF"}
