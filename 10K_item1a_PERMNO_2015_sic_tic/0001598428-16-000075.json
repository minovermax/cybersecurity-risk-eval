RISK FACTORS\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The risks that are highlighted below are not the only ones we face. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of these risks relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate, while others relate principally to our debt, the securities markets in general, ownership of our common shares and our spinoff from Timken. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry and Our Business\nCompetition in the steel industry, together with potential global overcapacity, could result in significant pricing pressure for our products.\nCompetition within the steel industry, both domestically and worldwide, is intense and is expected to remain so. The steel industry has historically been characterized by periods of excess global capacity and supply. Excess global capacity and supply has, and could continue to, negatively affected domestic steel prices, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. High levels of steel imports into the United States could exacerbate the decrease in domestic steel prices.\nAdditionally, in some applications, steel competes with other materials. Increased use of materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products.\nAny change in the operation of our raw material surcharge mechanisms, a raw material market index or the availability or cost of raw materials and energy resources could materially affect our revenues and earnings.\nWe require substantial amounts of raw materials, including scrap metal and alloys and natural gas, to operate our business. Many of our customer contracts contain surcharge pricing provisions that are designed to enable us to recover raw material cost increases. The surcharges are generally tied to a market index for that specific raw material. Recently, many raw material market indices have reflected significant fluctuations. Any change in a raw material market index could materially affect our revenues. Any change in the relationship between the market indices and our underlying costs could materially affect our earnings. Any change in our projected year-end input costs could materially affect our last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory valuation method and earnings.\nMoreover, future disruptions in the supply of our raw materials could impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers or require us to pay higher prices in order to obtain these raw materials from other sources, and could thereby affect our sales and profitability. Any increase in the prices for such raw materials could materially affect our costs and therefore our earnings.\nWe rely to a substantial extent on third parties to supply certain raw materials that are critical to the manufacture of our products. Purchase prices and availability of these critical raw materials are subject to volatility. At any given time we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials on a timely basis, on acceptable price and other terms, or at all. If suppliers increase the price of critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. In addition, to the extent we have quoted prices to customers and accepted customer orders for products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, or have existing contracts, we may be unable to raise the price of products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials.\nOur operating results depend in part on continued successful research, development and marketing of new and/or improved products and services, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services.\nThe success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. Our business is affected, to varying degrees, by technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which could result in unpredictable product transitions or shortened life cycles. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production, or marketing of new products and services that may prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market.\nNew technologies in the steel industry may: (a) improve cost competitiveness; (b) increase production capabilities; or (c) improve operational efficiency compared to our current production methods. However, we may not have sufficient capital to invest in such technologies or to make certain capital improvements, and may, from time to time, incur cost over-runs and difficulties adapting and fully integrating these technologies or capital improvements into our existing operations. We may also encounter control or production restrictions, or not realize the cost benefit from such capital intensive technology adaptations or capital improvements to our current production processes. Customers continue to demand stronger and lighter products, among other adaptations to traditional products. We may not be successful in meeting these technological challenges and there may be increased\nliability exposure connected with the supply of additional products and services or an adverse impact to our results of operations and profitability.\nOur business is capital intensive, and if there are downturns in the industries we serve, we may be forced to significantly curtail or suspend operations with respect to those industries, which could result in our recording asset impairment charges or taking other measures that may adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nOur business operations are capital intensive, and we devote a significant amount of capital to certain industries. If there are downturns in the industries we serve, we may be forced to significantly curtail or suspend our operations with respect to those industries, including laying-off employees, recording asset impairment charges and other measures. In addition, we may not realize the benefits or expected returns from announced plans, programs, initiatives and capital investments. Any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nWe are dependent on our key customers.\nAs a result of our dependence on our key customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if any of the following, among other things, were to occur: (a) a loss of any key customer, or a material amount of business from such key customer; (b) the insolvency or bankruptcy of any key customer; (c) a declining market in which customers reduce orders; or (d) a strike or work stoppage at a key customer facility, which could affect both its suppliers and customers. For the year ended December 31, 2015, sales to our 10 and 20 largest customers accounted for approximately 44% and 63% of our net sales, respectively.\nWeakness in global economic conditions or in any of the industries or geographic regions in which we or our customers operate, as well as the cyclical nature of our customers\u2019 businesses generally or sustained uncertainty in financial markets, could adversely impact our revenues and profitability by reducing demand and margins.\nOur results of operations may be materially affected by the conditions in the global economy generally and in global capital markets. There has been volatility in the capital markets and in the end markets and geographic regions in which we or our customers operate, which has negatively affected our revenues. Many of the markets in which our customers participate are also cyclical in nature and experience significant fluctuations in demand for our steel products based on economic conditions, consumer demand, raw material and energy costs, and government actions, and many of these factors are beyond our control. For example, as the price of crude oil and natural gas has decreased, we have experienced volatility in our Energy & Distribution segment because our customers in this segment are conducting less drilling and production activity. Declines in crude oil and natural gas prices could continue to have a negative impact on drilling, completion and production activities, and thus the need for our steel products. If sustained, such declines could lead to a material decrease in such activities, which could further harm our profitability, cash flow and financial condition.\nA decline in consumer and business confidence and spending, together with severe reductions in the availability and increased cost of credit, as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets, could adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business. We also are exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers and customers. If the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers\u2019 business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased, the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to either access credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts. These conditions and a disruption of the credit markets could also result in financial instability of some of our suppliers and customers. The consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase, and bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors. Any of these events could adversely affect our profitability, cash flow and financial condition.\nOur capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements, and we are exposed to risks associated with financial, credit, capital and banking markets.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we will seek to access competitive financial, credit, capital and/or banking markets. Currently, we believe we have adequate capital available to meet our reasonably anticipated business needs based on our historic financial performance, as well as our expected financial position. However, if we need to obtain additional financing in the future, to the extent our access to competitive financial, credit, capital and/or banking markets was to be impaired, our operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nProduct liability, warranty and product quality claims could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe produce high-performance carbon and alloy steel, sold as ingots, bars and tubes in a variety of chemistries, lengths and finishes designed for our customers\u2019 demanding applications. Failure of the materials that are included in our customers\u2019 applications could give rise to product liability or warranty claims. There can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to meet a customer\u2019s specifications for its products, we may be subject to product quality costs and claims. A successful warranty or product liability claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nThe cost and availability of electricity and natural gas are also subject to volatile market conditions.\nSteel producers like us consume large amounts of energy. We rely on third parties for the supply of energy resources we consume in our steelmaking activities. The prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are also subject to volatile market conditions, often affected by weather conditions as well as political and economic factors beyond our control. As large consumers of electricity and gas, we must have dependable delivery in order to operate. Accordingly, we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption. Prolonged black-outs or brown-outs or disruptions caused by natural disasters or by political considerations would substantially disrupt our production. Moreover, many of our finished steel products are delivered by truck. Unforeseen fluctuations in the price of fuel would also have a negative impact on our costs or on the costs of many of our customers. In addition, changes in certain environmental laws and regulations, including those that may impose output limitations or higher costs associated with climate change or greenhouse gas emissions, could substantially increase the cost of manufacturing and raw materials, such as energy, to us and other U.S. steel producers.\nWe may incur restructuring and impairment charges that could materially affect our profitability.\nChanges in business or economic conditions, or our business strategy, may result in actions that require us to incur restructuring or impairment charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which impose substantial costs and limitations on our operations, and environmental, health and safety compliance and liabilities may be more costly than we expect.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning matters such as worker health and safety, air emissions, wastewater discharges, hazardous material and solid and hazardous waste use, generation, handling, treatment and disposal and the investigation and remediation of contamination. We are subject to the risk of substantial liability and limitations on our operations due to such laws and regulations. The risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to compliance with these laws and regulations, which tend to become more stringent over time, are an inherent part of our business, and future conditions may develop, arise or be discovered that create substantial environmental compliance or remediation or other liabilities and costs.\nCompliance with environmental, health and safety legislation and regulatory requirements may prove to be more limiting and costly than we anticipate. To date, we have committed significant expenditures in our efforts to achieve and maintain compliance with these requirements, and we expect that we will continue to make significant expenditures related to such compliance in the future. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings brought by private parties or governmental authorities with respect to environmental matters, including matters involving alleged contamination, property damage or personal injury. New laws and regulations, including those which may relate to emissions of greenhouse gases, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFrom both a medium- and long-term perspective, we are likely to see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit relatively significant amounts of greenhouse gases as a result of new and existing legal and regulatory initiatives, such as any initiatives resulting from the Paris Agreement on climate change adopted in December 2015. These initiatives will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future legal and regulatory initiatives become known, we cannot predict the effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nUnexpected equipment failures or other disruptions of our operations may increase our costs and reduce our sales and earnings due to production curtailments or shutdowns.\nInterruptions in production capabilities would likely increase our production costs and reduce sales and earnings for the affected period. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities and information technology systems are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or violent weather conditions. Our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment for which there may be only limited or no production alternatives, such as furnaces,\ncontinuous casters and rolling equipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers, and this equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. In the future, we may experience material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of these types of equipment failures, which could cause us to lose or prevent us from taking advantage of various business opportunities or prevent us from responding to competitive pressures.\nA significant portion of our manufacturing facilities are located in Stark County, Ohio, which increases the risk of a significant disruption to our business as a result of unforeseeable developments in this geographic area.\nIt is possible that we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unforeseen catastrophic events occurring in or around our manufacturing facilities in Stark County, Ohio. As a result, we may be unable to shift manufacturing capabilities to alternate locations, accept materials from suppliers, meet customer shipment deadlines or address other significant issues, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to risks relating to our information technology systems.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and manage and operate our business. A breach in security could expose us and our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, production downtimes and operations disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business or results of operations. While we have policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures, interruptions, and security breaches, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. Although we rely on commonly used security and processing systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from all potential compromises or breaches of security.\nWork stoppages or similar difficulties could significantly disrupt our operations, reduce our revenues and materially affect our earnings.\nA work stoppage at one or more of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 58% of our employees were covered under one of two collective bargaining agreements that run through December 2016 and September 2017, respectively. Any failure to negotiate and conclude new collective bargaining agreements with the unions when the existing agreements expire could cause work interruptions or stoppages. Also, if one or more of our customers were to experience a work stoppage, that customer may halt or limit purchases of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations that could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, U.S. and foreign export and trading laws, and laws governing improper business practices. We are affected by new laws and regulations, and changes to existing laws and regulations, including interpretations by courts and regulators. With respect to tax laws, with the finalization of specific actions contained within the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation\u2019s, or OECD, Base Erosion and Profit study, or the Actions, many OECD countries have acknowledged their intent to implement the Actions and update their local tax regulations. The extent (if any) to which countries in which we operate adopt and implement the Actions could affect our effective tax rate and our future results from non-U.S. operations.\nCompliance with the laws and regulations described above or with other applicable foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of our management could have a material adverse effect on our business. Modern steel-making uses specialized techniques and advanced equipment and requires experienced engineers and skilled laborers. Our future success will depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, such as engineers and experienced laborers, as well as finance, marketing and senior management professionals. Competition for these employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high-quality employees, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not realize the improved operating results that we anticipate from past and future acquisitions and we may experience difficulties in integrating acquired businesses.\nWe may seek to grow, in part, through strategic acquisitions and joint ventures, which are intended to complement or expand our businesses. These acquisitions could involve challenges and risks. In the event that we do not successfully integrate these acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment, our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have loss carryforwards in the U.S. and various non-U.S. jurisdictions totaling $196.2 million having various expiration dates, as well as certain credit carryforwards. The majority of the non-U.S. loss carryforwards represent local country net operating losses for entities treated as branches of TimkenSteel under U.S. tax law. Tax benefits have been recorded for these losses in the U.S. In addition, we may accrue additional U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards during 2016 and thereafter. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss and credit carryforwards is dependent upon our ability to generate taxable income in future periods and may be limited due to restrictions imposed on utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards under federal and state laws upon a change in stock ownership.\nSection 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, provide an annual limitation on our ability to utilize our U.S. net operating loss and credit carryforwards against future U.S. taxable income in the event of a change in stock ownership that is beyond our control, as defined in the Code. Accordingly, any such occurrences could adversely impact our ability to offset future tax liabilities and, therefore, adversely affect our financial condition, net income and cash flow.\nRisks related to our debt\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts and any strategic alliances or acquisitions we may make in the future depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Further, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements governing our other indebtedness will restrict our ability to operate our business, which may affect the market price of our common shares.\nOur amended credit facility contains, and agreements governing indebtedness we may incur in the future may contain, covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, pay dividends, make investments, enter into transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate with other entities or sell all or substantially all of our assets. A breach of any covenant could result in a default, which could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under the applicable debt immediately due and payable and which may affect the market price of our common shares. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under our indebtedness. Please refer to Note 6 - \u201cFinancing Arrangements\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail on the agreements governing the amended credit facility.\nRisks related to our common shares\nThe price of our common shares may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common shares may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in operating results or business prospects;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nan inability to meet or exceed securities analysts\u2019 estimates or expectations;\n\u2022\nconditions or trends in our industry or sector;\n\u2022\nthe performance of other companies in our industry or sector and related market valuations;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives;\n\u2022\ngeneral financial, economic or political instability;\n\u2022\nhedging or arbitrage trading activity in our common shares;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\ncapital commitments;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common shares or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, our common shares.\nMany of the factors listed above are beyond our control. These factors may cause the market price of our common shares to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and Ohio law could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, even if that change may be considered beneficial by some of our shareholders, which could reduce the market price of our common shares.\nThe existence of some provisions of our articles of incorporation and regulations and Ohio law could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us that a shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nproviding that our board of directors fixes the number of members of the board;\n\u2022\nproviding for the division of our board of directors into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred shares, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding securities of ours with voting rights and thwart a takeover attempt.\nAs an Ohio corporation, we are subject to Chapter 1704 of the Ohio Revised Code, or Chapter 1704. Chapter 1704 prohibits certain corporations from engaging in a \u201cchapter 1704 transaction\u201d (described below) with an \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder, unless, among other things, prior to the interested shareholder\u2019s share acquisition date, the directors of the corporation have approved the transaction or the purchase of shares on the share acquisition date.\nAfter the three-year moratorium period, the corporation may not consummate a Chapter 1704 transaction unless, among other things, it is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power in the election of directors and the holders of a majority of the voting shares, excluding all shares beneficially owned by an interested shareholder or an affiliate or associate of an interested shareholder, or the shareholders receive certain minimum consideration for their shares. A Chapter 1704 transaction includes certain mergers, sales of assets, consolidations, combinations and majority share acquisitions involving an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder is defined to include, with limited exceptions, any person who, together with affiliates and associates, is the beneficial owner of a sufficient number of shares of the corporation to entitle the person, directly or indirectly, alone or with others, to exercise or direct the exercise of 10% or more of the voting power in the election of directors after taking into account all of the person\u2019s beneficially owned shares that are not then outstanding.\nWe are also subject to Section 1701.831 of the Ohio Revised Code, or Section 1701.831, which requires the prior authorization of the shareholders of certain corporations in order for any person to acquire, either directly or indirectly, shares of that corporation that would entitle the acquiring person to exercise or direct the exercise of 20% or more of the voting power of that corporation in the election of directors or to exceed specified other percentages of voting power. The acquiring person may complete the proposed acquisition only if the acquisition is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote in the election of directors represented at the meeting, excluding the voting power of all \u201cinterested shares.\u201d Interested shares include any shares held by the acquiring person and those held by officers and directors of the corporation.\nWe believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal, and are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay, defer or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of our company and our shareholders, which under certain circumstances could reduce the market price of our common shares.\nWe may issue preferred shares with terms that could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common shares.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred shares having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common shares respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred shares could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common shares. For example, we could grant holders of preferred shares the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred shares could affect the residual value of the common shares.\nRisks Relating to the Spinoff\nOur historical consolidated financial information are not necessarily indicative of our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows nor do they reflect what our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows would have been as an independent public company during the periods presented.\nSome of the historical consolidated financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not reflect what our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows would have been as an independent public company during the periods presented and is not necessarily indicative of our future financial condition, future results of operations or future cash flows. This is primarily a result of the following factors:\n\u2022\nthese historical consolidated financial results reflect allocations of expenses for services historically provided by Timken, and those allocations may be significantly lower than the comparable expenses we would have incurred as an independent company;\n\u2022\nour working capital requirements and capital expenditures historically were satisfied as part of Timken\u2019s corporate-wide capital allocation and cash management programs; as a result, our debt structure and cost of debt and other capital may be significantly different from that reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements;\n\u2022\nthe historical consolidated financial information may not fully reflect the increased costs associated with being an independent public company, including significant changes that have occurred in our cost structure, management, financing arrangements and business operations as a result of our spinoff from Timken; and\n\u2022\nthe historical consolidated financial information may not fully reflect the effects of certain liabilities that will be incurred or have been assumed by us and may not fully reflect the effects of certain assets and liabilities that have been retained by Timken.\nPlease refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our Consolidated Financial Statements and corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe remain subject to continuing contingent liabilities of Timken following the spinoff.\nThere are several significant areas where the liabilities of Timken may yet become our obligations. The separation and distribution agreement and employee matters agreement generally provide that we are responsible for substantially all liabilities that relate to our steel business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the spinoff, as well as those liabilities of Timken specifically assumed by us. In addition, under the Internal Revenue Code (Code) and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the Timken consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the completion of the spinoff is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire Timken consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period. In connection with the spinoff, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with Timken that allocated the responsibility for prior period taxes of the Timken consolidated tax reporting group between us and Timken. However, if Timken is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes. Other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities.\nIf the spinoff does not qualify as a tax-free transaction, Timken could be subject to material amounts of taxes and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify Timken for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement.\nThe spinoff was conditioned on Timken\u2019s receipt of an opinion from Covington & Burling LLP, special tax counsel to Timken (or other nationally recognized tax counsel), in form and substance satisfactory to Timken, that the distribution of our common shares in the spinoff qualified as tax-free (except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares) to us, Timken and Timken shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) and related provisions of the Code. Such opinion was delivered to us by special tax counsel prior to the effectiveness of our registration statement on Form 10 relating to the spinoff. The opinion relied on, among other things, various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by Timken and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, could jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. We are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause the assumptions or representations relied on in the opinion of counsel to be inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect. The opinion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the qualification of the spinoff as a transaction under Sections 355 and 368(a) of the Code will not be challenged by the IRS or by others in court, or that any such challenge would not prevail.\nIf, notwithstanding receipt of the opinion of counsel, the spinoff were determined not to qualify under Section 355 of the Code, Timken would be subject to tax as if it had sold common shares in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over its tax basis in such shares.\nWith respect to taxes and other liabilities that could be imposed on Timken in connection with the spinoff (and certain related transactions) under the terms of the tax sharing agreement we entered into with Timken prior to the spinoff, we may be liable to Timken for any such taxes or liabilities attributable to actions taken by or with respect to us, any of our affiliates, or any person that, after the spinoff, is an affiliate thereof. We may be similarly liable if we breach specified representations or covenants set forth in the tax sharing agreement. If we are required to indemnify Timken for taxes incurred as a result of the spinoff (or certain related transactions) being taxable to Timken, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPotential liabilities associated with certain assumed obligations under the tax sharing agreement cannot be precisely quantified at this time.\nUnder the tax sharing agreement with Timken, we are responsible generally for all taxes paid after the spinoff attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries, whether accruing before, on or after the spinoff. We have also agreed to be responsible for, and to indemnify Timken with respect to, all taxes arising as a result of the spinoff (or certain internal restructuring transactions) failing to qualify as transactions under Sections 368(a) and 355 of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes (which could result, for example, from a merger or other transaction involving an acquisition of our shares) to the extent such tax liability arises as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation by us or certain affiliates made in connection with the issuance of the tax opinion relating to the spinoff or in the tax sharing agreement. As described above, such tax liability would be calculated as though Timken (or its affiliate) had sold its common shares of our company in a taxable sale for their fair market value, and Timken (or its affiliate) would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over its tax basis in such shares. That tax liability could have a material adverse effect on our company.\nWe may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or equity raising transactions following the spinoff. In addition, under some circumstances, we could be liable for any adverse tax consequences resulting from engaging in significant strategic or capital raising transactions.\nEven if the spinoff otherwise qualifies as a tax-free distribution under Section 355 of the Code, the spinoff may result in significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities to Timken under applicable provisions of the Code if 50% or more of Timken\u2019s shares or our shares (in each case, by vote or value) are treated as having been acquired, directly or indirectly, by one or more persons (other than the acquisition of our common shares by Timken shareholders in the spinoff) as part of a plan (or series of related transactions) that includes the spinoff. Under those provisions, any acquisitions of Timken shares or our shares (or similar acquisitions), or any understanding, arrangement or substantial negotiations regarding an acquisition of Timken shares or our shares (or similar acquisitions), within two years before or after the spinoff are subject to special scrutiny. The process for determining whether an acquisition triggering those provisions has occurred is complex, inherently factual and subject to interpretation of the facts and circumstances of a particular case. If a direct or indirect acquisition of Timken shares or our shares resulted in a change in control as contemplated by those provisions, Timken would recognize taxable gain. Under the tax sharing agreement, there are restrictions on our ability to take actions that could cause the separation to fail to qualify as a tax-free distribution, and we will be required to indemnify Timken against any such tax liabilities attributable to actions taken by or with respect to us or any of our affiliates, or any person that, after the spinoff, is an affiliate thereof. We may be similarly liable if we breach certain other representations or covenants set forth in the tax sharing agreement. As a result of the foregoing, we may be unable to engage in certain strategic or capital raising transactions that our shareholders might consider favorable, including use of our common shares to make acquisitions and equity capital market transactions, or to structure potential transactions in the manner most favorable to us, without adverse tax consequences, if at all.\nPotential indemnification liabilities to Timken pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe entered into a separation and distribution agreement with Timken that provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to affect the spinoff, certain conditions to the spinoff and provisions governing the relationship between our company and Timken with respect to and resulting from the spinoff. Among other things, the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our steel business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the spinoff, as well as those obligations of Timken assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement. If we are required to indemnify Timken under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities.\nIn connection with our separation from Timken, Timken will indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Timken\u2019s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future.\nPursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, Timken agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Timken has agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Timken will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Timken will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Timken any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these costs ourselves. If Timken is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations, the underlying liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, Timken\u2019s insurers may deny coverage to us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to the spinoff. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from such insurance providers, we may be required to temporarily bear such loss of coverage.", "PERMNO": 14684, "SIC": 3312, "TIC": "TMST"}
