{"cik": "1368993", "company": "WaferGen Bio-systems, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. This discussion highlights some of the risks that may affect future operating results. These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important to consider. We cannot be certain that we will successfully address these risks. If we are unable to address these risks, our business may not grow, our stock price may suffer and we may be unable to stay in business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Company and Our Business\nWe have generated only limited sales, have a history of operating losses and we may not be able to reach profitability.\nWe have a history of losses and expect to continue to incur operating and net losses for the foreseeable future. We incurred a net loss of $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit was $106.8 million. We have not achieved operating profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nHistorically, there have been limited sales of any of our products. Our revenues were $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. We will need to significantly grow our revenues to become profitable.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future and such capital raising may be costly or difficult to obtain and could dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership interests.\nWe have incurred losses since inception and expect to continue to incur losses until we are able to significantly grow our revenues. Accordingly we may need additional financing to maintain and expand our business. Such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity linked securities may dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in the market value of our equity securities. The terms of any securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect on the holders of any of our securities then outstanding.\nIf we are unable to obtain such additional financing on a timely basis, we may have to curtail our development activities and growth plans and/or be forced to sell assets, perhaps on unfavorable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately could be forced to discontinue our operations and liquidate, in which event it is unlikely that stockholders would receive any distribution on their shares. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Part II, Item 7 in this Annual Report. Further, if we do not generate sufficient revenues from operations, we may not be able to stay in business.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible promissory notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial results.\nOur success depends on our ability to develop commercially successful products and on market acceptance of our new and relatively unproven technologies.\nOur future is dependent upon the success of the current and future generations of one or more of the products we sell or propose to sell, including the SmartChip System and Apollo instruments. We may not possess all of the resources, capability and intellectual property rights necessary to develop and commercialize all of the products or services that may result from our technologies. Our long-term viability, growth and profitability will depend upon successful testing, approval and commercialization of the SmartChip System incorporating our technology resulting from our research and development activities. Adverse or inconclusive results in the development and testing of our products could significantly delay or ultimately preclude commercialization of our technology. Accordingly, there is only a limited basis upon which to evaluate our business and prospects. An investor in our Company should consider the challenges, expenses, and difficulties we will face seeking to develop and manufacture a new product in a relatively new and rapidly changing market. Some of the factors affecting market acceptance of our products and services include:\n\u2022\navailability, quality and price of our products and services compared to our competitors\u2019;\n\u2022\nthe functionality of our products and services, and whether they address market requirements;\n\u2022\nthe timing of introduction of our products and services as compared to our competitors\u2019;\n\u2022\nthe existence of product defects; and\n\u2022\nscientists\u2019 and customers\u2019 opinions of our products and services and our ability to incorporate their feedback into future products and services.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to improve our existing products, to develop new products that serve existing markets, and to develop new products that create new markets and applications that were previously not practical with existing systems. We currently have fewer resources available for research and development activities than many of our competitors. We may not be able to develop or launch new products in a timely manner, or at all, or they may not meet customer requirements or be of sufficient quality or at a price that enables us to compete effectively in the marketplace. Challenges frequently encountered in connection with the development or early commercialization of products and services using new and relatively unproven technologies might limit our ability to develop and successfully commercialize these products and services. If our research and product development efforts do not result in commercially viable products within anticipated timelines, if at all, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe expect to make significant investments to research and develop Smart Chip-based solutions for single-cell genomics, which may not be successful.\nWe are currently focusing our R&D efforts on the development and commercialization of Smart Chip-based solutions for single-cell genomics. We have devoted, and expect to continue to devote, significant resources to the development of single-cell products. Our efforts to develop single-cell analysis products may not be successful, may cause us to incur significant expense and may distract our management from successfully commercializing existing products. We may not be able to introduce products for single-cell genomics as quickly as anticipated. Any single-cell analysis products we develop will be subject to significant research and testing, which may be a lengthy and expensive process. There can be no guarantee that we will develop any products that would be commercially viable. If we determine that our single-cell analysis programs, or any future development programs, are unlikely to succeed, we may abandon them without any return on our investment into those programs.\nBecause our business depends on research and development spending levels for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic and governmental research institutions, our success and our operating results will substantially depend on these customers.\nWe expect that much of our revenue in the foreseeable future will be derived primarily from products and services provided to a relatively small number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic, governmental and other research institutions. Our success will depend upon their demand for and use of our products and services. Our operating results may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by these customers. For example,\nreductions in capital or operating expenditures by these customers may result in lower than expected instrumentation sales and similarly, reductions in operating expenditures by these customers could result in lower than expected sales by us. A number of our customers and potential customers rely on government funding for their research and development expenditures. A significant or prolonged decrease in government funding for academic or scientific research may significantly impact our customers\u2019 and potential customers\u2019 research and development expenditures, which could have an adverse impact on future revenues and results of operations.\nWe expect that our results of operations will fluctuate, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of high-value products, the impact of seasonal spending patterns, the timing and size of research projects our customers perform, changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry, the timing and amount of government grant funding programs and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns. Given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services, we may experience quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenue and/or a sequential decline in quarterly revenue.\nIf revenue does not grow significantly, we will not be able to achieve and maintain profitability. Any significant delays in the commercial launch of our products, unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines, or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenues. Due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and expenses, we believe that quarterly comparisons of our results are not a good indication of our future performance. If our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors, our stock price probably would decline.\nIf we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, we may be unable to achieve our goals.\nWe are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel. The loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives. We compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies, universities and research institutions, particularly those focusing on genomics. Competition for these individuals, particularly in the San Francisco Bay area, is intense, and the turnover rate can be high. Our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating existing employees. Failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results may be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nSince we sell and source products in many different countries, changes in exchange rates could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations in the future. Furthermore, reported sales and purchases made in non-U.S. currencies, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement. We cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on future sales and operating results.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or detect fraud. Consequently, investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting and this may decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nWe must maintain effective disclosure and internal controls to provide reliable financial reports. We have been assessing our controls to identify areas that need improvement. Based on our evaluation as of December 31, 2015, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2015, however, we have identified material weaknesses in the past and may do so again in the future. Failure to maintain the improvements in our controls as necessary to maintain an effective system of such controls could harm our ability to accurately report our operating results and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Any such loss of confidence would have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nAny failure to maintain adequate disclosure and internal controls may result in restatements of our financial statements and may cause us to become subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including, among others, increased professional fees and expenses, the increased possibility of legal proceedings and review by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and other regulatory bodies and could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, shareholder class actions or derivative actions. We could face monetary judgments, penalties or other sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause our stock price to decline.\nLitigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our products or services or adversely impact our stock price.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties and the ability to protect our own intellectual property.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization even if we are not. As we enter new markets, we expect that competitors will likely assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into those markets. Third parties may have obtained, and may in the future obtain, patents and claim that our products or activities infringe these patents. We could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against these claims even if we are eventually successful in defending ourselves against these claims. Furthermore, parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief, which effectively could block our ability to further develop, commercialize, manufacture, use and sell methods and products, and could result in the award of substantial damages against us. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties, or be prohibited from making, using or selling certain methods and/or products. We may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, or at all. In that event, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products, and the prohibition of sale of any of our products could materially affect our ability to grow and to attain profitability.\nOur proprietary intellectual property rights may not adequately protect our products and technologies.\nAlthough we have filed a number of United States and international patent applications, we presently have six patents issued in the United States, which do not cover all of our products and technologies. Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for our products and technologies. Patent law relating to claims in the technology fields in which we operate is uncertain, so we cannot be assured the patent rights we have, or may obtain in future, will be valuable or enforceable. We may only be able to protect products and technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets cover them. Furthermore, the degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep a competitive advantage.\nThe patent positions of life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such companies\u2019 patents has emerged to date in the United States. The laws of some countries other than the United States do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology and/or pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of any patents we may obtain in such countries. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. For example:\n\u2022\nwe might not have been the first to conceive or reduce to practice one or more inventions disclosed in our pending patent applications;\n\u2022\nwe might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative products and technologies or duplicate any of our products and technologies;\n\u2022\nit is possible that none of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents, and even if they issue as patents, they may not provide a basis for commercially viable products, and/or may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged and invalidated by third parties;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary products and technologies that are patentable; and\n\u2022\nthird-party patents may have an adverse effect on our ability to continue to grow our business.\nWe have applied, and continue to apply, for patents covering our intellectual property (e.g., products and technologies and uses thereof), as we deem appropriate. However, we may fail to apply for patents on products and/or technologies in a timely fashion or at all.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we attempt to use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, or scientific and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. If we were to attempt to enforce a claim that a third-party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it could be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome could be unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets than courts inside the United States. Moreover, if our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, it may be difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property and our business could be harmed.\nIf we are not able to defend the patent or trade secret protection position of our products and technologies, then we may not be able to exclude competitors from developing or marketing competing products, and we may not generate enough revenue from product sales to justify the cost of development of our products and to achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe do not presently have significant intellectual property rights licensed from third parties but, in the future, we may have to license intellectual property from key strategic partners. We may become reliant upon such third parties to protect their intellectual property rights to any licensed technology. Such third parties may not protect the intellectual property rights that we license from them and we may be unable defend such intellectual property rights on our own or we may have to undertake costly litigation to defend the intellectual property rights of such third parties. There can be no assurances that we will continue to have proprietary rights to any of the intellectual property that we license from such third parties or otherwise have the right to use through similar strategic relationships. Any loss or limitations on use with respect to our right to use such intellectual property licensed from third parties or otherwise obtained from third parties or with whom we have entered into strategic relationships could negatively impact our competitive advantage.\nWe face intense competition in our target markets, which could render our products and/or technologies obsolete, result in significant price reductions or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell. If we cannot continuously develop and commercialize new products better than our competitors, our revenue may not grow as intended and we may not be able to become or remain profitable.\nFuture competition will likely come from existing competitors as well as other companies seeking to develop new technologies for analyzing genetic information, such as next generation sequencing. Some of our competitors have various products and/or methodologies for gene detection, expression, characterization, and/or analyses that may be competitive with our products and/or methodologies. For example, companies such as 10X Genomics, Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc., Fluidigm Corporation, Illumina, Inc., PerkinElmer, Inc. and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. have products for genetic analysis that are directly competitive with certain of our products. In addition, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have significant needs for genomic information and may choose to develop or acquire competing technologies to meet these needs. In the molecular diagnostics field, competition will likely come from established diagnostic companies, companies developing and marketing DNA probe tests for genetic and other diseases and other companies conducting research on new technologies to ascertain and analyze genetic information. Further, in the event that we develop new technology and products that compete with existing technology and products of well-established companies, there can be no guarantee that the marketplace will readily adopt any such new technology and products that we may introduce in the future.\nThe market for genetic research and molecular diagnostic products is highly competitive, with several large companies already having significant market share. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, many current and potential competitors have greater name recognition, more extensive customer bases, well developed and productive collaborative arrangements with key companies and academic researchers and access to proprietary genetic content. Established genetic research and diagnostic companies have an installed base of instruments in several markets, including clinical and reference laboratories. These companies have formed alliances with genomics companies that provide them access to genetic information that may be incorporated into their diagnostic tests. We may not be able to compete effectively with these companies.\nOur manufacturing capacity may limit our ability to sell our products.\nThere are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities and we may not be able to increase our capacity in a timely manner. For example, manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facility and launch new products. As a result, we may experience difficulties in meeting customer demand, in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions, and demand for our products could decline. Due to the intricate nature of manufacturing products, we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields, impact our ability to launch or sell these products, or to produce them economically, prevent us from achieving expected performance levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers.\nIf demand for our products is reduced, our manufacturing capacity could be under-utilized and some of our long-lived assets, including facilities and equipment, may be impaired, which would increase our expenses. Changes in demand for our products, and changes in our customers\u2019 product needs, could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results, and, in certain cases, may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, or lower our gross margin percentage.\nWe may lose customers or sales if we are unable to meet customer demand for our products on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if we are unable to ensure the proper performance and quality of our products.\nWe produce our products in an innovative and complicated manufacturing process which has the potential for significant variability in manufacturing yields. We may encounter difficulties in manufacturing our products and, due to the complexity of our products and our manufacturing process, we may experience delays in the manufacture of our products or fail to ensure their proper performance or quality. As we develop new and enhanced products, we must be able to resolve in a timely, cost-effective manner manufacturing issues that may arise from time to time.\nIf product sale quantities or the mix of products sold differs materially from our expectations, this could adversely impact our financial results. Difficulties in meeting customer, collaborator and internal demand could also cause us to lose customers or require us to delay new product introductions, which could in turn result in reduced demand for our products.\nWe rely on internal quality control procedures to verify our manufacturing processes. Due to the complexity of our products and manufacturing process, however, it is possible that products that do not meet all of our performance specifications may not be identified before they are shipped. If our products do not consistently meet our customers' performance expectations, demand for our products will decline. In addition, we do not maintain any backup manufacturing capabilities for the production of our products. Any interruption in our ability to continue operations at our existing manufacturing facilities could delay our ability to develop or sell our products, which could result in lost revenue and seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reliance on outside manufacturers and suppliers to provide certain instruments could subject us to risks that may harm our business.\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our instruments to a limited number of suppliers. From time to time we may change manufacturers, and any new manufacturer engaged by us may not perform as expected. If our vendors experience shortages or delays in their manufacture of our instruments, or if we experience quality problems with our vendors, then our shipment schedules could be significantly delayed or costs significantly increased. Certain of our instruments may be manufactured or supplied by a single vendor, which could magnify the risk of shortages or delays. If supplies from our vendors do not meet our requirements or were delayed or interrupted for any reason, we would not be able to commercialize our products successfully or in a timely fashion, and our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe may be adversely affected by environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and municipal environmental, health and safety laws based on our use of hazardous materials in both our manufacturing and research and development operations. These laws and regulations often require expensive compliance procedures or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. A violation of these laws and regulations can result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions and/or operational shutdown. Furthermore, we may become liable for the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination, whether intentional or unintentional, and we could be responsible for damages related to the clean-up of such contamination or individual injury caused by such contamination. We may also be subject to related claims by private parties alleging property damage and personal injury due to exposure to hazardous or other materials as a result of such contamination. Some of these matters may require expending significant amounts for investigation, cleanup or other costs. Events such as these could negatively impact our financial position.\nOur sales, marketing and technical support organization may limit our ability to sell our products.\nWe currently have limited resources available for sales, marketing and technical support services as compared to some of our primary competitors. In order to effectively commercialize our genetic analysis systems and other products to follow, we will need to expand our sales, marketing and technical support staff both domestically and internationally. We may not be successful in establishing or maintaining either a direct sales force or distribution arrangements to market our products and services. In addition, we compete primarily with much larger companies that have larger sales and distribution staffs and a significant installed base of products in place, and the efforts of a limited sales and marketing force may not be sufficient to build the market acceptance of our products required to support continued growth of our business.\nConsolidation trends in both our market and many of our customers' markets have increased competition.\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for the past several years. We expect this trend toward industry consolidation to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could lead to more variability in operating results and could harm our business.\nIn addition, there has been a trend toward consolidation in many of the customer markets we sell to, in particular the pharmaceutical industry. Consolidation in our customer markets results in increased competition for important market segments and fewer available accounts, and larger consolidated customers may be able to exert increased pricing pressure on companies in our market.\nWe market and sell, and plan to market and sell, our products in numerous international markets. If we are unable to manage our international operations effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe market and sell, and plan to market and sell, our products in a number of foreign countries, including Canada, European Union countries, Japan, China and other East Asian countries, and we are therefore subject to risks from failure to comply with foreign laws and regulations that differ from those under which we operate in the U.S. as well as U.S. rules and regulations that govern foreign activities such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In addition, we may be adversely affected by other risks associated with operating in foreign countries. Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate, including developing regions, could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas.\nRisks inherent in international operations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic and political conditions in the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nunexpected adverse changes in foreign and U.S. laws or regulatory requirements, including those with respect to permitting, export duties and quotas;\n\u2022\nchanges by foreign governments in their support of genetic analysis research;\n\u2022\ntrade barriers such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses, which could increase the prices of our products and make us less competitive in some countries;\n\u2022\ndiffering local preferences and expectations for laboratory equipment and supplies;\n\u2022\ndiffering approaches to genetic analysis research at pharmaceutical and biotech companies, academic and private research centers and other diagnostic companies;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in exchange rates, which may affect demand for our products and may adversely affect our profitability;\n\u2022\ndifficulty of, and costs relating to compliance with, the different commercial and legal requirements of the overseas markets in which we offer and sell our products;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-U.S. operations;\n\u2022\npotential changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain, maintain or enforce intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\ndifficulty in enforcing agreements in foreign legal systems.\nOur business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries. Our overall success as a global business depends, in part, on our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions. We may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain or monitor our information systems our business could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on information systems to control our manufacturing, customer service, distribution, website and the processes for managing inventory, fulfilling orders, responding to inquiries, contributing to our overall internal control processes, maintaining records of our property, plant and equipment, and recording and paying amounts due vendors and other creditors. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in our information systems that involve interactions with customers and suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and/or increased costs, which could adversely affect our business.\nSecurity breaches, including with respect to cybersecurity, and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information, and that of our customers, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. The secure maintenance of this information is important to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our systems and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and damage to our reputation.\nWe may be exposed to liability due to product defects.\nThe risk of product liability claims is inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of research products for therapeutic and diagnostic development. We may seek to acquire additional insurance for clinical liability risks. We may not be able to obtain such insurance or general product liability insurance on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts. A product liability claim or recall could negatively impact our financial position.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management.\nIn January 2014, we acquired from IntegenX Inc. (\u201cIntegenX\u201d) substantially all of the assets of its product line used in connection with developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling instruments and reagents relating to library preparation for next generation sequencing, including the Apollo 324 instrument and the PrepX reagents (the \u201cApollo Business\u201d). In the future we may acquire additional companies, product lines, or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of this acquisition or any other future acquisition and any acquisition has numerous risks. These risks include the following: difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company; difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current technologies and products; difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures, and policies during the transition and integration; disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from other opportunities and challenges due to integration issues; difficulty integrating the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information, and other administrative systems; inability to retain key technical and sales personnel of the acquired business; inability to retain key customers, vendors, and other business partners of the acquired business; inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses; incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results; potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality, legal and financial liabilities, among other things; potential inability to assert that internal controls over financial reporting are effective. Mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky, and ultimately, if we do not complete the integration of the acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe may pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions, which may be very risky and may not be successful.\nOur strategy envisions, if an opportunistic target is identified, future growth from acquiring and integrating similar operations and/or product lines. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and, once identified, to negotiate successfully their acquisition at a price or on terms and conditions favorable to us, or to integrate the operations of such acquired businesses with the existing operations. In addition, we compete for acquisition candidates with other entities, some of which have greater financial resources than ours. Failure to implement successfully our acquisition strategy would limit our potential growth. Furthermore, if we enter into strategic discussions with a potential acquisition candidate whose business is competitive to ours, we must be very careful to prevent the acquisition target from obtaining sensitive, proprietary information about us that it could use to our detriment if a deal is not completed.\nWe may consider acquisitions or strategic transactions that could result in the target\u2019s shareholders receiving a substantial amount, or even a majority of our voting securities. If we completed such a transaction, our current shareholders would have a reduced influence on our operations, and there may be significant changes in our management and board of directors. Any acquisition we may pursue also involves the risk of diverting our management\u2019s attention from the normal daily operations of our business. Also, there is always a risk that an acquisition may not be profitable. Any strategic transaction that we pursue may involve substantial integration costs and risks. Many resources and assets of the proposed strategic partner may be duplicative of our own resources and assets. We may assume liabilities in connection with acquisitions that we may not fully understand or which may be more significant than we anticipate. We may also anticipate that strategic transactions will provide cost savings or growth opportunities that may never be realized.\nAn interruption in our ability to manufacture our products or an inability to obtain key components or raw materials due to a catastrophic disaster or infrastructure could adversely affect our business.\nWe currently manufacture in a single location. Our manufacturing facility is located in the San Francisco Bay Area in California. This area is subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or floods. If a natural disaster were to damage our facility significantly or if other events were to cause our operations to fail, we may be unable to manufacture our products, provide our services, or develop new products. In addition, if the capabilities of our suppliers and component manufacturers are limited or stopped, due to disasters, quality, regulatory, or other reasons, it could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to move to new headquarters upon the termination of the lease for our current headquarters without any effect to our business.\nThe Company conducts its operations from leased premises. We have received written notice from the landlord for our headquarters at 7400 Paseo Padre Drive, Fremont, California, that our lease will be terminated effective April 12, 2016. We use this location as our corporate headquarters, laboratory and manufacturing facility. Effective March 1, 2016, we entered into a new lease for a facility located at 34700 Campus Drive, Fremont, California, to replace the terminated lease. If we do not vacate our present premises by April 12, 2016, we may become liable for significant damages, along with a substantial increase in rent. There is no assurance that we will be able to move into our new headquarters without any material interruption to our business.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function.\nWe design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries. The usefulness of our technology depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease. We are focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function, namely gene expression profiling. This market is new and emerging, and may not develop as quickly as we anticipate, or reach its full potential. Other methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing. Also, researchers may not seek or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information through the analysis of genetic variation and biological function. In addition, factors affecting research and development spending generally, such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies, and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions, could harm our business. If useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner, demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe may not be able to deliver acceptable products to our customers due to the rapidly evolving nature of genetic sequence information upon which our products are based.\nThe genetic sequence information upon which we may rely to develop and manufacture our products is contained in a variety of public and private databases throughout the world. These databases are rapidly expanding and evolving. In addition, the accuracy of such databases and resulting genetic research is dependent on various scientific interpretations, and it is not expected that global genetic research efforts will result in standardized genetic sequence databases for particular genomes in the near future.\nAlthough we have implemented ongoing internal quality control efforts to help ensure the quality and accuracy of our products, the fundamental nature of our products requires us to rely on genetic sequence databases and scientific interpretations which are continuously evolving. As a result, these variables may cause us to develop and manufacture products that incorporate sequence errors or ambiguities. The magnitude and importance of these errors depends on multiple and complex factors that would be considered in determining the appropriate actions required to remedy any inaccuracies. Our inability to timely deliver acceptable products as a result of these factors would likely adversely affect our relationship with customers, and could negatively impact our financial condition.\nWe face risks associated with technological obsolescence and emergence of standardized systems for genetic analysis.\nHigh throughput genetic analyses and quantitative detection methodologies (including, for example, PCR) are undergoing rapid evolution and technological changes. New technologies, techniques or products could emerge which might allow the packaging and analysis of genomic information at densities similar to, or even higher than, our existing or future technology. Other companies may begin to offer products that are directly competitive with, or are technologically superior to, our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our technological advantages over emerging technologies in the future. Over time, we will need to respond to technological innovation in a rapidly changing industry. Standardization of tools and systems for genetic research is still ongoing and there can be no assurance that our products will emerge as the standard for genetic research. The emergence of competing technologies and systems as market standards for genetic research may result in our products becoming uncompetitive which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends on the continuous development of new products and our ability to manage the transition from our older products to new products.\nWe compete in markets that are new, intensely competitive, highly fragmented and rapidly changing, and many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, many current and potential competitors have greater name recognition, more extensive customer bases and access to proprietary genetic content. The continued success of our products will depend on our ability to produce products with smaller feature sizes and create greater information capacity at our current or lower costs. The successful development, manufacture and introduction of our new products is a complicated process and depends on our ability to manufacture and supply enough products in sufficient quantity and quality and at acceptable cost in order to meet customer demand. If we fail to keep pace with emerging technologies or are unable to develop, manufacture and introduce new products, we will become uncompetitive, our pricing and margins will decline, and our business will suffer.\nOur failure to successfully manage the transition between our older products and new products may adversely affect our financial results. As we introduce new or enhanced products, we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers\u2019 ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands. When we introduce new or enhanced products, we face numerous risks relating to product transitions, including the inability to accurately forecast demand and difficulties in managing different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new products.\nEthical, legal and social concerns surrounding the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our products.\nGenetic testing has raised ethical issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information. For these reasons, governmental authorities and others may call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those that have no known cure. Similarly, such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible. Any of these scenarios could reduce the potential markets for our products.\nOur products and services, or the products and services of our customers, could become subject to regulation by the FDA or other regulatory agencies in the future.\nOur products are currently labeled, promoted and sold to academic institutions, private research institutions, and pharmaceutical,\nbiotechnology and diagnostics companies for research purposes only, and not as diagnostic tests or medical devices. As products labeled, promoted and intended for research use only (\u201cRUO\u201d), they are not subject to regulation as medical devices by the FDA. Products labeled and intended for research use are not currently subject to regulation as medical devices by comparable agencies of other countries. However, the FDA or other regulators in the U.S. or elsewhere could disagree with our conclusion that our products are for research use only or deem our current marketing and promotional efforts as being inconsistent with RUO products. In addition, if we change the labeling or promotion of our products in the future to include indications for human diagnostic applications or medical uses, including treatment of diseases or medical conditions, or we have knowledge that our customers are using our products for clinical diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, our products or related applications could be subject to additional regulation as in vitro diagnostic devices, such as under the FDA\u2019s pre- and post-market regulations for medical devices. For example, if we wish to label, promote or advertise our products for use in performing clinical diagnostics, we would first need to obtain FDA pre-market clearance or approval (depending on any product\u2019s specific intended use and any such modified labeling claims), unless otherwise exempt from clearance or approval requirements. Obtaining FDA clearance or approval can be expensive and uncertain, and generally takes several months to years to obtain, and may require detailed and comprehensive scientific and clinical data. Notwithstanding the expense, these efforts may never result in FDA clearance or approval. Even if we were to obtain regulatory approval or clearance, it may not be for the uses we believe are important or commercially attractive.\nFurther, the FDA may expand its regulatory oversight of our products or the products of our customers, which could impose restrictions on our ability to market and sell our products. For example, our customers may elect to use our RUO labeled products in their own laboratory developed tests (\u201cLDTs\u201d), for clinical diagnostic use. However, the market for LDTs could shrink significantly if the FDA decides to actively regulate LDTs. Historically, the FDA has generally not regulated LDTs, which are currently regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (\u201cCLIA\u201d). However, on October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents that set forth the FDA\u2019s proposed risk-based framework for regulating LDTs, which are designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory. The draft guidance documents provide the anticipated details through which the FDA would propose to establish an LDT oversight framework, including premarket review for higher-risk LDTs, such as those that have the same intended use as FDA-approved or cleared companion diagnostics currently on the market. The guidance documents, if and when finalized, may significantly impact the sales of our products and how customers use our products, and may require us to change our business model in order to maintain compliance with these laws.\nAdditionally, on November 25, 2013, the FDA issued Final Guidance \u201cDistribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only.\u201d The guidance emphasizes that the FDA will review the totality of the circumstances when it comes to evaluating whether equipment and testing components are properly labeled as RUO. The final guidance states that merely including a labeling statement that the product is for research purposes only will not necessarily render the device exempt from the FDA\u2019s clearance, approval, and other regulatory requirements if the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicate that the manufacturer knows its product is, or intends for its product to be, offered for clinical diagnostic uses. These circumstances may include written or verbal marketing claims or links to articles regarding a product\u2019s performance in clinical applications and a manufacturer\u2019s provision of technical support for clinical applications. If the FDA imposes significant changes to the regulation of LDTs, or modifies its approach to our products labeled and intended for research use only, it could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, if the FDA determined that our products labeled for research use only were intended, based on a review of the totality of circumstances, for use in clinical investigation or diagnosis, those products could be considered misbranded or adulterated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and subject to recall or other enforcement action.\nWe may be required to proactively achieve compliance with certain FDA regulations and to conform our manufacturing operations to the FDA\u2019s good manufacturing practice regulations for medical devices, known as the Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d), as part of our contracts with customers or as part of our collaborations with third parties. In addition, we may voluntarily seek to conform our manufacturing operations to QSR requirements. For clinical diagnostic products that are regulated as medical devices, the FDA enforces the QSR through pre-approved inspections and periodic unannounced inspections of registered manufacturing facilities. If we are subject to QSR requirements, the failure to comply with those requirements or take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection could result in enforcement actions, including a public warning letter or an untitled letter, a delay in approving or clearing, or a refusal to approve or clear, our products, a shutdown of manufacturing operations, a product recall, civil or criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could in turn cause our sales and business to suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Organization\nEven though we are not a California corporation, our common stock could still be subject to a number of key provisions of the California General Corporation Law.\nUnder Section 2115 of the California General Corporation Law (\u201cCGCL\u201d), corporations not organized under California law may still be subject to a number of key provisions of the CGCL. This determination is based on whether the corporation has significant\nbusiness contacts with California and if more than 50% of its voting securities of record are held by persons having addresses in California. In the immediate future, the majority of our business operations, revenue and payroll will be conducted in, derived from, and paid to residents of California. Therefore, depending on our ownership, we could be subject to some provisions of the CGCL. Among the more important provisions are those relating to the election and removal of directors, cumulative voting, standards of liability and indemnification of directors, distributions, dividends and repurchases of shares, stockholder meetings, approval of some corporate transactions, dissenters\u2019 and appraisal rights, and inspection of corporate records. If we are required to comply with these provisions, this compliance could cause us to incur additional administrative and legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s time and attention from the operation of our business.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert our management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other applicable securities rules and regulations. We are subject to the Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs, made some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increased demand on our systems and resources. Among other things, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and results of operations. Although we currently employ staff to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire even more employees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price could be volatile.\nThe market price of the common stock has fluctuated significantly since it was first quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board on June 6, 2007. Since this date, through December 31, 2015, the intra-day trading price has fluctuated from a low of $0.70 to a high of $3,130.79. The price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in the economic performance and/or market valuations of other life science companies;\n\u2022\nour announcement of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022\nsales or other transactions involving our capital stock.\nEven with our common stock being traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that investors will be interested in purchasing our common stock when our stockholders want to dispose of their shares or at prices that are attractive to our stockholders.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the requirements for our common stock to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nSince becoming listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market on August 22, 2014, we have been required to comply with certain Nasdaq listing requirements, including, without limitation, with respect to our corporate governance, finances and stock price. If we fail to meet any of these requirements, our shares could be delisted. In particular, Nasdaq rules include a $1.00 minimum bid price requirement.\nOn December 21, 2015, we received a notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market indicating that we were not in compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement. In accordance with Nasdaq listing rules, we have 180 calendar days, or until June 20, 2016, to regain compliance with minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance,\nthe bid price of our common stock must close at or above $1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days at any time before June 20, 2016. On June 20, 2016, if we meet the Nasdaq Capital Market initial listing criteria, except for the minimum bid price requirement, we may be provided with an additional 180 calendar-day compliance period. If we are not eligible for an additional compliance period at that time, Nasdaq staff will provide us with written notification that our common stock will be delisted. Upon such notice, we may appeal the Nasdaq staff\u2019s delisting determination to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel pursuant to the procedures set forth in the applicable Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. There can be no assurance that, if we appeal any such determination of the Nasdaq staff, such appeal would be successful.\nThere can be no assurances that we will regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s minimum bid price requirement, or, even if we do regain compliance, that we will be able to maintain our Nasdaq listing.\nIf our common stock were delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, it would likely lead to a number of negative implications, including an adverse effect on the price of our common stock, reduced liquidity in our common stock, the loss of federal preemption of state securities laws and greater difficulty in obtaining financing. In the event of a delisting, we would expect to take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements.\nStockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock and our preferred stock.\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We are authorized to issue an aggregate of 310,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which 18,712,631 shares were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2015, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which 430 (each convertible into 10,000 shares of common stock, subject to certain ownership limitations) were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2015. The Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock has no voting rights. Future issuances of preferred stock will have preferences and rights as may be determined by our board of directors at the time of issuance. Specifically, our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of common stock. In addition, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our common stock or that is convertible into common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of the common stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had notes in favor of Malaysian Technology Development Corporation Sdn. Bhd. (\u201cMTDC\u201d) outstanding with a face value of $5.2 million which we could have settled by issuing an aggregate of 6,550,768 shares of our common stock, and we had 450,676 outstanding restricted stock units, outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 477,438 shares of our common stock, outstanding unit warrants to purchase 64,700 shares of our common stock and 32,350 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, and outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 23,032,838 shares of our common stock. The future vesting or exercise of these securities will subject our existing stockholders to experience dilution of their ownership interests.\nWe may also issue additional shares of common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any additional shares of our common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with any capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of our common stock are then traded.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, to some extent, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our business prospects, our share price would likely decline. If one or\nmore of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nStockholders should not anticipate receiving cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings to support operations and to finance expansion and therefore do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 14880, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "WGBS"}
