RISK FACTORS\nThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S., as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and our Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in Item 8 of this Report. For ease of review, the risk factors generally have been grouped into categories, but many of the risks described in a given category relate to multiple categories.\nRisks Related to General Economic Factors\nThe Company has incurred a material drop in advertising revenues as COVID-19 continues.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent government restrictions caused and continue to cause significant declines in demand for certain products and services of ours, which ultimately affects advertising revenue. As such, certain aspects of our operating results have experienced lower revenue and profitability over 2021 and 2020 and these trends are expected to continue in the future.\nOur advertising revenues may decline due to weakness in the brick and mortar retail sector.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from advertising. The demand for advertising is sensitive to the overall level of economic strength, both in the markets in which we operate and nationally. Also, the decline in the financial or economic conditions of our advertisers could alter discretionary spending by advertisers. Certain segments of the economy have been challenged in recent years, particularly in the brick and mortar retail sector, and total advertising revenues have declined as a result. Advertising revenues may worsen if advertisers reduce their budgets, shift their spending priorities, are forced to consolidate, or cease operations.\nOur ability to generate revenue is highly sensitive to the strength of the economies in which we operate and the demographics of the local communities that we serve.\nOur advertising and marketing services revenues and subscription revenues depend upon a number of factors, including the size and demographic characteristics of the local population; the general local economic conditions; and the economic condition of the retail segments in the communities that our publications serve. In the case of an economic downturn in a market, our publications, revenues, and profitability in that market could be adversely affected. Our advertising and marketing services revenues could also be affected by negative trends in the general economy that affect consumer spending. The advertisers in our newspapers, other publications, and related websites are primarily retail businesses that can be significantly affected by regional or national economic downturns and other developments. Declines in the U.S. economy could also significantly affect key advertising revenue categories, such as help wanted, real estate, and automotive.\nUncertainty and adverse changes in the general economic conditions of markets in which we participate may negatively affect our business.\nCurrent and future economic conditions are inherently uncertain. It is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction for the economy as a whole, and even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors, and regions of the economy, including the markets our publications serve. Adverse changes may occur as a result of weak global economic conditions, declining oil prices, wavering consumer confidence, unemployment, declines in stock markets, contraction of credit availability, declines in real estate values, natural disasters, or other factors affecting economic conditions in general. These changes may negatively affect the sales of our products, increase exposure to losses from bad debts, increase the cost and decrease the availability of financing, or increase costs associated with publishing and distributing our publications.\nThe collectability of accounts receivable under adverse economic conditions could deteriorate to a greater extent than provided for in our financial statements and in our projections of future results.\nAdverse economic conditions in the U.S. may increase our exposure to losses resulting from financial distress, insolvency, and the potential bankruptcy of our advertising and marketing services customers. Our accounts receivable is stated at net estimated realizable value, and our allowance for credit losses has been determined based on several factors, including receivable agings, significant individual credit risk accounts, and historical experience. If such collectability estimates prove inaccurate, adjustments to future operating results could occur.\nThe value of our intangible assets may become impaired, depending upon future operating results.\nAt September 26, 2021, the carrying value of our goodwill was $330,204,000, the carrying value of mastheads was $39,672,000, and the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets was $116,999,000. The indefinite-lived assets (goodwill and mastheads) are subject to annual impairment testing and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain events or significant changes in our circumstances that indicate all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable, in which case a non-cash charge to earnings may be necessary in the relevant period. We may subsequently experience market pressures which could cause future cash flows to decline below our current expectations, or volatile equity markets could negatively impact market factors used in the impairment analysis, including earnings multiples, discount rates, and long-term growth rates. Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely affect future reported results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nFor further information on goodwill and intangible assets, see Note 5 - Goodwill and other intangible assets.\nRisk Related to Competition from Digital Media\nOur operating revenue may be materially adversely affected if we do not successfully respond to the shift in newspaper readership and advertising expenditures away from traditional print media and towards digital media. Significant capital investments may be needed to respond to this shift.\nCurrently, a primary source of revenue is from advertising and marketing services, which accounts for 46% of our revenue. Subscription revenue accounts for 45% of our revenue. The media publishing industry has experienced rapid evolution in consumer demands and expectations due to advances in technology, which have led to a proliferation of delivery methods for news and information. The number of consumers who access online services through devices other than personal computers, such as tablets and mobile devices, has increased dramatically in recent years and likely will continue to increase. The media publishing industry also continues to be affected by demographic shifts, with older generations preferring more traditional print newspaper delivery and younger generations consuming news through digital media. Also, the revenues generated by media publishing companies have been affected significantly by the shift in advertising expenditures towards digital media.\nThe future revenue performance of our digital business depends to a significant degree upon the growth development and management of our subscriber and advertising audiences. The growth of our digital business over the long term depends on various factors, including, among other things, the ability to:\n\u2022 Continue to increase digital audiences;\n\u2022 Attract advertisers to our digital platforms;\n\u2022 Tailor our products to efficiently and effectively deliver content and advertising on mobile devices;\n\u2022 Maintain or increase the advertising rates on our digital platforms;\n\u2022\nExploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of competitors and develop new content, products and services;\n\u2022\nInvest funds and resources in digital opportunities;\n\u2022\nPartner with, or use services from, providers that can assist us in effectively growing our digital business; and\n\u2022\nCreate digital content and platforms that attract and engage audiences in our markets.\nIf we are unable to grow our digital audience, distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or develop compelling new products and services that engage users across multiple platforms, then our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. Responding to the changes described above may require us to make significant capital investments and incur significant research and development costs related to building, maintaining, and evolving our technology infrastructure, and our ability to make the level of investments required may be limited.\nSee \u201cAudiences\u201d in Item 1, included herein, for additional information on about our print and digital audiences.\nRisks Related to Takeover Attempts\nAlden\u2019s unsolicited proposal to acquire us may divert management\u2019s attention and resources, cause us to incur substantial costs, and have an adverse effect on our business.\nOn November 22, 2021, we received an unsolicited proposal from Alden Global Capital, LLC (with its affiliates, \u201cAlden\u201d) to acquire the Company for $24.00 per share in cash (the \u201cUnsolicited Proposal\u201d). On December 9, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors, in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors, unanimously determined to reject the Unsolicited Proposal, as it significantly undervalues the Company and is not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.\nThe events surrounding the Unsolicited Proposal and related circumstances and our response have required, and may continue to require, significant time and attention by management and our Board of Directors and have required us, and may continue to require us, to incur significant legal and advisory fees and expenses. Further, actions taken by Alden or other third parties as a result of the Unsolicited Proposal, including a proxy contest, could disrupt our business, distract us from efforts to improve our business, cause us to incur substantial additional expense, create perceived uncertainties among current and potential employees, customers, clients, suppliers, and other constituencies as to our future direction as a consequence thereof that may result in lost sales or other business arrangements and the loss of potential business opportunities, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. Actions that our Board of Directors has taken, and may take in the future, in response to any offer or other related actions by Alden, including the Unsolicited Proposal and Alden\u2019s purported notice of nominations in connection with our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders (which our Board of Directors determined was invalid under our by-laws for failing to comply with requirements of our by-laws), or any other offer or proposal may result in litigation against us. These lawsuits may be a significant distraction for our management and employees and may require us to incur significant costs. If determined adversely to us, these lawsuits could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We also believe the future trading price of our Common Stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations based on uncertainty associated with the Unsolicited Proposal.\nThe stockholder rights plan adopted by our Board of Directors may impair a takeover attempt.\nOn November 24, 2021, our Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan (the \u201cRights Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, on November 24, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a \u201cRight\u201d), payable on December 6, 2021, for each share of our Common Stock outstanding to the stockholders of record on that date. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one-thousandth of a share of Series B Participating Convertible Preferred Stock, without par value (the \u201cPreferred Shares\u201d), of the Company at a price of $120.00 per one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share represented by a Right, subject to adjustment.\nThe Rights will initially trade with our Common Stock and will generally become exercisable only if any person or group, other than certain exempt persons, acquires beneficial ownership of 10% (or 20% in the case of certain passive investors) or more of our Common Stock outstanding. In the event the Rights become exercisable, each holder of a Right, other than the triggering person(s), will be entitled to purchase additional shares of our Common Stock at a 50% discount or the Company may exchange each Right held by such holders for one share of our Common Stock. The Rights Agreement will continue in effect until November 23, 2022, or unless earlier redeemed or terminated by the Company, as provided in the Rights Agreement. The Rights have no voting or dividend privileges, and, unless and until they become exercisable, have no dilutive effect on the earnings of the Company.\nThe Rights Agreement applies equally to all current and future stockholders and is not intended to deter offers or preclude our Board of Directors from considering acquisition proposals that are fair and otherwise in the best interest of our stockholders. However, the overall effect of the Rights Agreement may render it more difficult or discourage a merger, tender offer, or other business combination involving us that is not supported by our Board of Directors.\nAdditional details about the Rights Agreement are contained in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on November 24, 2021.\nRisks Related to our Acquisitions of BH Media and Buffalo News\nOn March 16, 2020, the Company completed the purchase of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of the newspaper and related community publications business of BH Media and the purchase of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Buffalo News (collectively, the \u201cTransactions\u201d). Under the terms of the Asset and Stock Purchase Agreement, dated January 29, 2020, with Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (\u201cBerkshire\u201d), and BH Media (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d), the aggregate purchase price for the Transactions was $140 million, which excluded $12 million in cash at closing of the Transactions. BH Finance, LLC (\u201cBH Finance\u201d), an affiliate of Berkshire, financed the Purchase Agreement through the Credit Agreement, dated January 29, 2020 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d).\nThe Company borrowed $576 million from BH Finance under the Credit Agreement in order to finance the Transactions and refinance its outstanding indebtedness.\nWe may not achieve the intended benefits of the BH Media acquisition.\nWe completed the BH Media acquisition in March 2020, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the expected benefits of the transaction.\nThere are many challenges associated with integrating a material acquisition, such as our acquisition of BH Media and Buffalo News, including the integration of executive and other employee teams with historically different cultures and priorities; the coordination of personnel located across multiple geographic locations; retaining key management and other employees; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; the diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns; retaining existing business and operational relationships, including customers, suppliers and other counterparties, and attracting new business and operational relationships; unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; as well as unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisition. These and other challenges could result in unanticipated operational challenges and the failure to realize anticipated synergies in the expected timeframe or at all.\nIf we fail to realize anticipated synergies in the amount and within the timeframe expected, our actual financial condition and results of operations may differ materially from the illustrative financial information disclosed in connection with the acquisition, which was based on various assumptions and estimates that may prove to be incorrect. Such illustrative financial information did not constitute management\u2019s projections of future financial performance or results of operations; however, any material variance from such illustrative financial information could result in negative investor reactions that materially and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nOur actual financial condition and results of operations may differ materially even if synergies are realized, due to macroeconomic factors or a variety of other risks to our business that are independent of the acquisition.\nOur future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations.\nWith completion of the BH Media acquisition, the size of our business has increased significantly. Our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which poses substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. We cannot assure that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, and other benefits from the combination that we currently anticipate.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity\nOur business, operating results, and reputation may be negatively impacted, and we may be subject to legal and regulatory claims if there is a loss, destruction, disclosure, misappropriation, or alteration of or unauthorized access to data owned or maintained by us, or if we are the subject of a significant data breach or cyberattack.\nWe rely on our information technology and communications systems to manage our business data, including communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment and other business processes. These technologies and systems also help us manage many of our internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures and financial systems. Attempts to compromise information technology and communications systems occur regularly across many industries and sectors, and we may be vulnerable to security breaches resulting from accidental events (such as human error) or deliberate attacks. Moreover, the techniques used to attempt attacks and the perpetrators of such attacks are constantly expanding. We face threats both from use of malicious code (such as malware, viruses and ransomware), employee theft or misuse, advanced persistent threats, and phishing and denial-of-service attacks. The Company has complied with all applicable legal requirements relating to this activity. As cyberattacks become increasingly sophisticated, and as tools and resources become more readily available to malicious third parties, the Company will incur increased costs to secure its technology environment and there can be no guarantee that the Company\u2019s and our third-party vendors\u2019 actions, security measures and controls designed to prevent, detect or respond to security breaches, to limit access to data, to prevent destruction, alteration, or exfiltration of data, or to limit the negative impact from such attacks, can provide absolute security against compromise. As a result, our business data, communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment and other business processes may be lost, destroyed, disclosed, misappropriated, altered or accessed without consent and various controls, automated procedures and financial systems could be compromised.\nA significant security breach or other successful attack could result in significant remediation costs, including repairing system damage, engaging third-party experts, deploying additional personnel or vendor support, training employees, and compensation or incentives offered to third parties whose data has been compromised. These incidents may also lead to lost revenues resulting from a loss in competitive advantage due to the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, destruction or use of business data, the failure to retain or attract customers, the disruption of critical business processes or systems, and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources. Moreover, such incidents may result in adverse media coverage, which may harm our reputation. These incidents may also lead to legal claims or proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions and private lawsuits, and related legal fees, as well as potential settlements, judgments and fines. We maintain insurance, but the coverage and limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.\nOur possession and use of personal information and the use of payment cards by our customers present risks and expenses that could harm our business. Unauthorized access to or disclosure or manipulation of such data, whether through breach of our network security or otherwise, could expose us to liabilities and costly litigation and damage our reputation.\nOur online systems store and process confidential subscriber and other sensitive data, such as names, email addresses, addresses, and other personal information. Therefore, maintaining our network security is critical. Additionally, we depend on the security of our third-party service providers. Unauthorized use of or inappropriate access to our, or our third-party service providers\u2019 networks, computer systems and services could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information, including payment card (credit or debit) information, of our customers. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we or our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Non-technical means, for example, actions by an employee, can also result in a data breach. A party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our proprietary information or the information of our customers or users, cause interruption in our operations, or damage our computers or those of our customers or users. As a result of any such breaches, customers or users may assert claims of liability against us and these activities may subject us to legal claims, adversely impact our reputation, and interfere with our ability to provide our products and services, all of which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The coverage and limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.\nA significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their payment card accounts directly for all amounts charged by us. These customers provide payment card information and other personally identifiable information which, depending on the particular payment plan, may be maintained to facilitate future payment card transactions. Under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, we could be liable to the banks that issue the payment cards for their related expenses and penalties. In addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry data security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines or lose our ability to give our customers the option of using payment cards. If we were unable to accept payment cards, our business would be seriously harmed.\nThere can be no assurance that any security measures we, or our third-party service providers, take will be effective in preventing a data breach. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose customers or users. Failure to protect confidential customer data or to provide customers with adequate notice of our privacy policies could also subject us to liabilities imposed by United States federal and state regulatory agencies or courts. We could also be subject to evolving state laws that impose data breach notification requirements, specific data security obligations, or other consumer privacy-related requirements. Our failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Catastrophic and Other External Events\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations in many respects.\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic remain unpredictable and volatile. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact portions of the United States economy as well as our employees, advertisers, customers, suppliers and other people and entities with whom and which we do business. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to spread and the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, the use of social distancing, masks and other safety measures, shelter-in-place orders and business and government shutdowns and vaccines. We are taking precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, including temporarily requiring some employees to work remotely.\nOther factors and uncertainties include:\n\u2022\nthe severity and duration of the pandemic, including whether there are future waves or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases caused by future mutations or related variants of the virus;\n\u2022\nthe long-term impact of the pandemic on our business, including customer behaviors;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures;\n\u2022\nunknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to the pandemic response; and\n\u2022\nthe pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides.\nThe persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material impact on our digital and print advertising and subscriptions for an unknown length of time.\nWe expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to have a negative impact in the near term. The long-term impact will depend on the length, severity, and reoccurrence of the pandemic, as well as changes in consumer behavior. The COVID-19 pandemic may accelerate, hasten or worsen the other Risk Factors described in this Item 1A.\nGovernment-imposed COVID-19 vaccine mandates could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe United States Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration recently issued an Emergency Temporary Standard (\u201cETS\u201d) requiring that most employers with at least 100 employees ensure their employees become fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or require those employees who do not become fully vaccinated to obtain a negative COVID-19 test weekly. While the ETS is currently subject to a judicial stay, because we have over 100 employees the ETS applies to us if and when it becomes enforceable. Mandating the vaccination or weekly testing of all of our employees could be logistically difficult and costly, both economically and operationally, including possible labor disruptions, employee attrition, and a reduced ability to replace departing employees. Such issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, potentially reducing revenues and increasing costs\nNatural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health emergencies or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNatural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, derecho windstorms, floods, earthquakes, wildfires; acts of terrorism or violence, including active-shooter situations; and public health issues, including pandemics and quarantines, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to our properties, disruptions to our IT systems, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from our suppliers, and delays in the delivery of goods to our printing facilities. Public health issues, whether occurring in the U.S. or Canada, could disrupt our operations, the operations of suppliers, or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels.\nRisks Related to Competition\nWe compete with a large number of companies in the local media industry, including digital media businesses and, if we are unable to compete effectively, our advertising and subscription revenues may decline.\nWe compete for audiences and advertising revenue with newspapers and other media such as the internet, magazines, broadcast, cable and satellite television, radio, direct mail, outdoor billboards and yellow pages. As the use of the internet and mobile devices has increased, we have lost some classified advertising and subscribers to online advertising businesses and our free Internet sites that contain abbreviated versions of our publications. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. If we fail to compete effectively with competing newspapers and other media, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Pension Liabilities\nSustained increases in funding requirements of our pension and postretirement obligations may reduce the cash available for our business.\nPension plans were in a net overfunded position of $13.4 million at September 26, 2021, compared to an underfunded position of $71.5 million at September 27, 2020.\nOur pension and postretirement plans invest in a variety of equity and debt securities. Future volatility and disruption in the securities markets could cause declines in the asset values of our pension and postretirement plans. In addition, a decrease in the discount rates or changes to mortality estimates and other assumptions used to determine the liability could increase the benefit obligation of the plans. Unfavorable changes to the plan assets and/or the benefit obligations could increase the level of required contributions above what is currently estimated, which could reduce the cash available for our business and debt service.\nWe expect to be subject to additional withdrawal liabilities in connection with multiemployer pension plans, which may reduce the cash available for our business.\nWe contributed to various multiemployer defined benefit pension plans during 2021 under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements (\u201cCBAs\u201d). For plans that are in critical status, benefit reductions may apply/or we could be required to make additional contributions.", "PERMNO": 50286, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "LEE"}
