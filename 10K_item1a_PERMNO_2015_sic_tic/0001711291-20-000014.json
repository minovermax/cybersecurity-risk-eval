{"cik": "1711291", "company": "CURO Group Holdings Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-09", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or future results. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or share price in the future. You should carefully consider the risk factors.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not adequate to absorb our actual losses, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe face the risk that our customers will fail to repay their loans in full. We maintain an allowance for loan losses for estimated probable losses on company-funded loans and loans in default. See Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies and Nature of Operations\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for factors considered by management in estimating the allowance for loan losses. We also maintain a liability for estimated probable losses on loans funded by unrelated third-party lenders under our CSO programs, but for which we are responsible through the issuance of a guarantee. As of December 31, 2019, the sum of our aggregate reserve and allowance for losses on loans and liability for losses associated with the guaranty provided to the CSO lenders for loans not in default (including loans funded by unrelated third-party lenders under our CSO programs) was $117.5 million. This reserve, however, is an estimate. Actual losses are difficult to forecast, especially if such losses stem from factors that we have not experienced historically, and unlike traditional banks, we are not subject to periodic review by bank regulatory agencies of our allowance for loan losses. As a result, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual losses or comparable to that of traditional banks subject to regulatory oversight. If actual losses are greater than our reserve and allowance, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nBecause of the non-prime nature of our customers, we have historically experienced a high rate of net charge-offs (\"NCOs\") as a percentage of revenues and it is essential that we price loans appropriately in response to this and other factors. We rely on Curo and our proprietary credit and fraud scoring models, in the forecasting of loss rates. If we are unable to effectively forecast loss rates, it may negatively and materially impact our operating results.\nBecause of the non-prime nature of our customers, our business has much higher rates of charge-offs than traditional lenders. Accordingly, it is essential that our products are appropriately priced to take into account the credit risks of our customers. In\nmaking a decision whether to extend credit to prospective customers, and the terms on which we or the originating lenders are willing to provide credit, including the price, we and the originating lenders rely heavily on Curo and our proprietary credit and fraud scoring models, which comprise an empirically derived suite of statistical models built using third-party data, data from customers and our credit experience gained through monitoring the performance of customers over time. Our proprietary credit and fraud scoring models are based on our historical experience. However, without consistent enhancements to ensure optimal performance, our models will typically become less effective over time. If we are unable to rebuild Curo, or if it does not perform as expected, our products will experience increasing defaults or higher customer acquisition costs.\nIf Curo fails to adequately predict the creditworthiness of customers, or if it fails to assess prospective customers\u2019 financial ability to repay their loans, or any or all of the other components of our credit decision process fails, higher than forecasted losses may result. Similarly, if our scoring models overprice our products, we could lose customers. Furthermore, if we are unable to access the third-party data used in Curo, or access to such data is limited or cost prohibitive, the ability to accurately evaluate potential customers using Curo will be compromised. As a result, we may be unable to effectively predict probable credit losses inherent in the resulting loan portfolio, and we, and the originating lender, may consequently experience higher defaults or customer acquisition costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.\nAdditionally, if we make errors in the development and validation of any of the models or tools used to underwrite loans, such loans may result in higher delinquencies and losses. Moreover, if future performance of customer loans differs from past experience, which experience has informed the development of Curo, delinquency rates and losses could increase, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.\nIf Curo is unable to price the credit risk of the customer effectively, we would experience lower margins. Either our losses would be higher than anticipated due to underpricing products or customers may refuse to accept the loan if products are perceived as overpriced. Additionally, an inability to effectively forecast loss rates could also inhibit our ability to borrow from our debt facilities, which could further hinder our growth and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in the demand for our products and specialty financial services or our failure to adapt to such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe demand for a particular product or service may change due to a variety of factors such as regulatory restrictions that reduce customer access to particular products, the availability of competing or alternative products, reduction in our marketing spend, macroeconomic changes or changes in customers\u2019 financial conditions among other factors. If we fail to adapt to a significant change in our customers\u2019 demand for, or access to, our products or services, our revenue could decrease significantly. Even if we make adaptations or introduce new products or services to fulfill customer demand, customers may resist or may reject products whose adaptations make them less attractive or less available. The effects of changes to products or services on our business may not be fully ascertainable until the changes have been in effect for a period of time and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage our growth effectively.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully grow our business or that our current business, results of operations or financial condition will not suffer if we fail to prudently manage our growth. Failure to grow the business and generate estimated future levels of cash flow could inhibit our ability to service our debt obligations. Our expansion strategy, which contemplates disciplined growth in Canada and the U.S., increasing the market share of our online operations, selectively expanding our offering of installment loans and potential expansion in other international markets, is subject to significant risks. The profitability of our current operations and any future growth is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to appropriately price our products, our ability to manage credit risk, our ability to respond to regulatory and legislative changes, our ability to obtain and maintain financing to support these opportunities, our ability to hire, train and retain an adequate number of qualified employees, our ability to obtain and maintain any required regulatory permits and licenses and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as changes in regulatory and legislative environments.\nAs a result, the profitability and cash flows of our current operations could suffer if we do not successfully implement our growth strategy.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $790.5 million of debt outstanding, net of deferred financing costs, premiums and discounts. The amount of our indebtedness could have significant effects on our business, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired;\n\u2022\nwe must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our debt, which reduces funds available to use for operations, invest in our business, pay dividends to our stockholders and use for other purposes;\n\u2022\nwe could be at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that may have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022\nthe terms of our debt restricts our ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited.\nFor instance, as described above, if future changes in regulations affecting our products or services are enacted, these changes could adversely impact our current product offerings or alter the economic performance of our existing products and services. These changes, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with the terms of our debt.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, or if we confront regulatory uncertainty in our industry or challenges in debt capital markets, we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness prior to maturity on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest or other debt capital expense. A refinancing of our indebtedness could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and restrictions on our business operations. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness prior to maturity we will be required to pursue alternative measures that could include restructuring our current indebtedness, selling all or a portion of our business or assets, seeking additional capital, reducing or delaying capital expenditures or taking other steps to address obligations under the terms of our indebtedness.\nOur ability to meet our obligations depends on future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors, many of which we cannot control or predict. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future and our currently anticipated growth in revenue and cash flow may not be realized, either or both of which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we do not have enough capital resources, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then-existing debt, sell assets or borrow more funds, which we may not be able to accomplish on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives.\nThe preparation of our financial statements and certain tax positions taken by us require the judgment of management, and we could be subject to risks associated with these judgments.\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions, including allowances for loan losses, certain assumptions related to goodwill and intangibles, accruals related to self-insurance and CSO guarantee liability, that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. In addition, management\u2019s judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. As a result, our assumptions and provisions may not be sufficient to cover actual losses. If actual losses are greater than our assumptions and provisions, our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting (\u201cICFR\u201d), and if we are unable to implement and maintain effective ICFR in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock may be adversely effected, and we may become subject to litigation and regulatory investigation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we identified a material weakness in ICFR related to the improper or incomplete application of technical accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cUS GAAP\u201d) standards and related interpretations to complex or non-routine matters.\nAs further described above and in Part II, Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d of this Form 10-K, management has concluded that the material weakness discussed above is remediated at December 31, 2019. If the additional controls and procedures we have implemented are not effective, or if we identify new material weaknesses in the future in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not detect errors in a timely manner and our consolidated financial statements may be materially misstated. We or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective ICFR, which could harm our operating results, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and cause the trading price of our stock to fall. We may also fail to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could result in sanctions, lawsuits, or other adverse consequences that would materially harm our business. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d), the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, and become subject to litigation from investors and stockholders, which could harm our reputation and our financial condition, or divert financial and management resources from our core business.\nChanges in our financial condition or a potential disruption in the capital markets could reduce available capital.\nIf sufficient funds are not available from our operations, excess cash or from our debt agreements, we will be required to rely on the banking and credit markets to meet our financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs. We also expect to periodically access the debt capital markets to obtain capital to finance growth. Efficient access to the debt capital markets will be critical to our ongoing financial success. However, our future access to the debt capital markets could become restricted due to a variety of factors, including a deterioration of our earnings, cash flows, balance sheet quality, overall business or industry prospects, adverse regulatory changes, a disruption to or deterioration in the state of the capital markets or a negative bias toward our industry by consumers. Disruptions and volatility in the capital markets may cause banks and other credit providers to restrict availability of new credit. We may have more limited access to commercial bank lending than other businesses due to the negative bias toward our industry. As a result, commercial banks and other lenders have and may continue to restrict access to credit for participants in our industry. Our ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing capital market conditions. A disruption in the capital markets may adversely affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms that are satisfactory to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available at favorable terms, we may not have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities or respond to competitive challenges, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our strategic plans. Additionally, if the capital and credit markets experience volatility, and the availability of funds is limited, third parties with whom we do business may incur increased costs or business disruption and this could have a material adverse effect on our business relationships with such third parties.\nAny disruption in the availability of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nWe rely heavily upon Curo in almost every aspect of our business, including to process customer transactions, provide customer service, determine loan amounts, manage collections, account for our business activities, support regulatory compliance and generate the reporting used by management for analytical, loss management and decision-making purposes. Our store and online platform is part of an integrated data network designed to manage cash levels, facilitate underwriting decisions, reconcile cash balances and report revenue and expense transaction data. Curo could be disrupted and become unavailable due to a number of factors, including power outages, a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems and cyber-attacks on or sustained disruptions of these systems. Our back-up systems and security measures could fail to prevent a disruption in the availability of our information technology systems. A disruption in Curo could prevent us from performing fundamental aspects of our business, including loan underwriting, customer service, payments and collections, internal reporting and regulatory compliance.\nAdverse economic conditions could cause demand for our loan products to decline or make it more difficult for our customers to make payments on our loans and increase our default rates.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from consumer lending. Factors that may influence demand for our products and services include macroeconomic conditions, such as employment, personal income and consumer sentiment. Our underwriting standards require, among other things, our customers to have a steady source of income as a prerequisite for making a loan. Therefore, if unemployment increases among our customer base, the number of loans we originate will likely decline and the number of loan defaults could increase. If consumers become more pessimistic regarding the outlook for the economy and therefore spend less and save more, demand for consumer loans in general may decline. Accordingly, poor economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe failure to comply with debt collection regulations, or the failure of our third-party collection agencies to comply with debt collection regulations, could subject us to fines and other liabilities, which could harm our reputation and business.\nIn January 2020, we acquired Ad Astra, our exclusive provider of third-party collection services for our U.S. operations. The FDCPA regulates persons who regularly collect or attempt to collect, directly or indirectly, consumer debts owed or asserted to be owed to another person. Many states impose additional requirements on debt collection communications, and some of those requirements may be more stringent than the federal requirements. Moreover, regulations governing debt collection are subject to changing interpretations that differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We have used in the past, and may continue to use in the future, third-party collections agencies to collect on debts incurred by consumers of our credit products. Regulatory changes could make it more difficult for us and collections agencies to effectively collect on the loans we originate.\nIn addition, in 2016, the CFPB issued an outline of proposals intended to increase consumer protection pertaining to third-party debt collectors and others covered by the FDCPA, which would apply to our attempts, and the attempts of our third-party collection agencies, to collect debt originated by other lenders, including under our CSO programs. The proposals would not apply to our attempts to collect debt that we originate; however, the CFPB has announced that it plans to address consumer protection issues involving first-party debt collectors and creditors separately. The CFPB outline does not include proposed or final rules, and any future rules could be significantly different from those in the outline. The CFPB has not yet defined a date for any proposed rules related to debt collection nor has it defined the effective date for the implementation of final rules. We cannot give any assurances that the effect of such rules will not have a material impact on our U.S. products and services.\nGoodwill comprises a significant portion of our total assets. We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually. If we determine that it is necessary to implement a material, non-cash write-down, that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe carrying value of our goodwill was $120.6 million, or approximately 11.1% of our total assets, as of December 31, 2019. We assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at the reporting unit level, as defined by Financial Accounting Standard Board\u2019s (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 280 - Segment Reporting. Goodwill is assessed between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\nOur impairment reviews require extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level, could produce significantly different results. We may be required to recognize impairment of goodwill based on future events or circumstances which could include a significant change in the business climate, a change in strategic direction, legal factors, operating performance indicators, a change in the competitive environment, the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or future economic factors such as unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flows of our reporting units. Impairment of goodwill could result in material charges that could result in a material, non-cash write-down of goodwill, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Due to the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact that future economic consequences will have on our reporting units, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions regarding forecasted revenues or margins for certain of our reporting units are not achieved, we may be required to record goodwill impairment losses in future periods. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment will occur, and if it does occur, whether such charge would be material.\nOur lending business is somewhat seasonal, which causes our revenues to fluctuate, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to service our debt obligations.\nOur U.S. lending business typically experiences reduced demand in the first quarter as a result of our customers\u2019 receipt of tax refund checks. Demand for our U.S. lending services is generally greatest during the third and fourth quarters. This seasonality requires us to manage our cash flows over the course of the year. If a governmental authority were to pursue economic stimulus actions or issue additional tax refunds or tax credits at other times during the year, such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition during those periods.\nOur lending business in Canada is somewhat seasonal, although to a lesser extent than our U.S. lending business. We typically experience our highest demand in Canada in the third and fourth quarters with lower demand in the first quarter; however, the reduction in volume relating to tax refunds is not prevalent as in the U.S. If our consolidated revenues were to fall substantially below what we would normally expect during certain periods, our annual financial results and our ability to service our debt obligations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have covenants in our debt agreements which may restrict our flexibility to operate our business. If we do not comply with these covenants, our failure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur debt agreements contain customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on consolidated indebtedness, liens, investments, subsidiary investments and asset dispositions, and require us to maintain certain leverage and interest coverage ratios. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in reduced liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, an event of default under one of our debt agreements may result in our then-outstanding debt to become immediately due and payable. This would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operation or financial condition.\nThe implementation of new or changes in the interpretation of existing accounting principles, financial reporting requirements or tax rules could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with US GAAP and its interpretations are subject to change over time. If new rules or interpretations of existing rules require us to change our accounting, financial reporting or tax positions, our results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected, and we could be required to restate historical financial reporting.\nIn June 2016, FASB issued new guidance that will require lenders to adopt the current expected credit loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) approach to evaluate impairment of loans. The CECL approach requires evaluation of credit impairment based on an estimate of life of loan losses whereas rules currently in effect require the evaluation of credit impairment based on incurred losses. Given our status as an SRC, we are taking advantage of rules permitting deferment and we do not expect to adopt CECL until at least January 1, 2021 as permitted by ASU 2019-10 \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. See Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Nature of Operations\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the new standard and its potential effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nFailure to keep up with rapid technological changes and Internet regulations could harm our business.\nThe business of providing products and services such as ours over the internet is dynamic. We must keep pace with rapid technological change, consumer use habits, Internet security risks, risks of system failure or inadequacy and governmental regulation and taxation, and each of these factors could adversely impact our business. In addition, concerns about fraud, computer security and privacy and/or other problems may discourage additional consumers from adopting or continuing to use the Internet as a medium of commerce. In markets such as the U.S., where e-commerce generally has been available for some time and the level of market penetration of our online financial services is relatively high, acquiring new customers for our services may be more difficult and costly than it has been in the past. To expand our customer base, we must appeal to and acquire consumers who historically have used traditional means of commerce to conduct their financial services transactions. If these consumers prove to be less profitable than our previous customers, and we are unable to gain efficiencies in our operating costs, including our cost of acquiring new customers, our business could be adversely impacted.\nBecause we depend in large part on third-party lenders to provide the cash needed to fund our loans, an inability to affordably access third-party financing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur principal sources of liquidity to fund the loans we make to our customers are cash provided by operations, funds from third-party lenders under our CSO programs and our Non-Recourse Canada SPV Facility, which finances the origination of eligible U.S. and Canada Unsecured, Secured Installment and Open-End loans. However, we cannot guarantee we will be able to secure additional operating capital from third-party lenders or refinance our existing revolving credit facilities on reasonable terms or at all. As the volume of loans that we make to customers increases, we may have to expand our borrowing capacity on our existing Non-Recourse Canada SPV Facility or add new sources of capital. If the underlying collateral does not perform as expected, our access to the Non-Recourse Canada SPV Facility could be reduced or eliminated. The availability of these financing sources depends on many factors, some of which we cannot control. In the event of a sudden or unexpected shortage of funds in the banking system or capital markets, we may not be able to maintain necessary levels of funding without incurring high funding costs, suffering a reduction in the term of funding instruments or having to liquidate certain assets. If our cost of borrowing increases or we are unable to arrange new or alternative methods of financing on favorable terms, we may have to curtail our origination of loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may be unable to protect our proprietary technology and analytics or keep up with that of our competitors.\nThe success of our business depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our proprietary technology, including Curo, which we use for pricing and underwriting loans. We seek to protect our intellectual property with non-disclosure agreements we\nsign with third parties and employees and through standard measures to protect trade secrets. We also implement cybersecurity policies and procedures to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and technology. However, we may be unable to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information, detect unauthorized use or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. Our employees, including those working on Curo, have not been required to execute agreements assigning us proprietary rights to technology developed in the scope of their employment, although we intend to have employees sign such agreements in the future. Additionally, while we currently have a number of registered trademarks and pending applications for trademark registration, we do not own any patents or copyrights with respect to our intellectual property.\nIf competitors learn our trade secrets (especially with regard to our marketing and risk management capabilities), others attempt to acquire patent protection of algorithms similar to ours or our employees attempt to make commercial use of the technology they develop for us, it could be difficult to successfully prosecute to recover damages. Additionally, a third-party may attempt to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without our consent. The pursuit of a claim against a third-party or employee for infringement of our intellectual property could be costly, and there can be no guarantee that any such efforts would be successful. If we are unable to protect our software and other proprietary intellectual property rights, or to develop technologies that are as adaptive to changing consumer trends or appealing to consumers as the technologies of our competitors, our competitors would have an advantage over us.\nIf the information provided by customers or third parties to us is inaccurate, we may misjudge a customer\u2019s qualification to receive a loan, and our operating results may be harmed.\nOur lending decisions are based partly on information provided to us by loan applicants. If these applicants provide information to us that is inaccurate or misleading, our scoring may not accurately reflect the associated risk. In addition, data provided by third-party sources is a significant component of our scoring of loan applications and this data may contain inaccuracies. Inaccurate analysis of credit data that could result from false loan application information could harm our reputation, business and operating results. In addition, we use identity and fraud check analyzing data provided by external databases to authenticate each applicant's identity. There is a risk, however, that these checks could fail, and fraud may occur. We may not be able to recoup funds underlying loans made in connection with inaccurate statements, omissions of fact or fraud, in which case our revenue, operating results and profitability will be harmed. Fraudulent activity or significant increases in fraudulent activity could also lead to regulatory intervention, negatively affect our operating results, brand and reputation and require us to take steps to reduce fraud risk, which could increase our costs.\nThe failure of third parties who provide products, services or support to us could disrupt our operations or result in a loss of revenue.\nSome of our lending activity depends in part on support we receive from unaffiliated third parties. This includes third-party lenders who make loans to our customers under our CSO programs as well as other third parties that provide services to facilitate lending, loan underwriting and payment processing in our online lending consumer loan channels. If our relationship with any of these third parties end and we are unable to replace them or if any of these third parties do not maintain quality and consistency in their programs or services or become unable to provide their products and services to us, we could lose customers which would substantially decrease our revenue and earnings. Our revenue and earnings could also be adversely affected if any of those third-party providers make material changes to the products or services that we rely on. We also use third parties to support and maintain certain of our communication systems and information systems.\nIn Texas, we rely on third-party lenders to conduct business. Regulatory actions can materially and adversely affect our third-party product offerings.\nIn Texas, we currently operate as a CSO or a CAB, arranging for unrelated third-parties to make loans to our customers. Through December 31, 2019, our CSO program in Texas generated revenues of $281.0 million. There are a limited number of third-party lenders that make these types of loans and there is significant demand and competition for the business of these companies. These third parties rely on borrowed funds to make consumer loans. If they lose their ability to make loans or become unwilling to make loans to us and we are unable to find another third-party lender, we would be unable to continue offering loans in Texas as a CSO, which would prevent us from receiving revenue from these activities. This could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nPrior to May 2019, we operated as a CSO in Ohio. Due to regulatory changes in Ohio approved in 2018, which effectively eliminated the viability of the CSO model in Ohio, we stopped operating as a CSO in Ohio in April 2019.\nWhen the Texas' legislature reconvenes in 2021, the results of Ohio\u2019s House Bill 123 could be used as a model to implement a similar law in Texas. If we are not able to adapt or introduce new products to counteract the impact of a similar law and ruling in Texas as that of Ohio\u2019s House Bill 123, our results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nCompetition in the financial services industry could cause us to lose market share and revenues.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly fragmented. While we believe the market for U.S. storefronts is mature, it is likely that competition for market share will intensify. We believe the Canadian market is less saturated, but still experiences significant competition by both large, well-financed operators, as well as significant numbers of smaller competitors. Across all geographies, we see a growing number of sophisticated online-based lenders. Increased competition in any of the geographies in which we operate could lead to consolidation in our industry. If our competitors get stronger through consolidation, and we are unable to identify attractive consolidation opportunities, we could be at a competitive disadvantage and could experience declining market share and revenue. If these events materialize, they could negatively affect our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to fund our operations and service our debt obligations.\nIn addition to increasing competition among companies that offer traditional consumer loan products, there is a risk of losing market share to new market entrants. Increased competition from secured title loan lenders, pawn lenders and unsecured installment loan lenders could also adversely affect our revenues.\nOur growth strategy contemplates disciplined opening of additional stores in the U.S. and Canada, and expanding our online presence in each of those geographies. If our competitors aggressively pursue store expansion, competition for store sites could result in our failing to open our planned number of stores, or increase our costs to secure additional sites, both of which could result in slower growth and lower operating performance. Increased competition in our online business could result in higher advertising and marketing costs to attract and retain customers, leading to lower margins.\nOur international scope of our operations leads to increased cost and complexity, which could negatively affect operations.\nOperating our business in two countries increases the complexity of managing our business. This has led to enhanced administrative burdens related to regulatory compliance, tax compliance, labor controls and other federal, state, provincial and local requirements. Additional resources, both internal and external, are required to comply with these increasing requirements, resulting in increased corporate costs. Other future changes to laws or regulations may result in further cost increases, thereby negatively impacting our profitability.\nOur core operations are dependent upon maintaining relationships with banks and other third-party electronic payment solutions providers. Any inability to manage cash movements through the banking system or the Automated Clearing House (\u201cACH\u201d) system would materially impact our business.\nWe maintain relationships with commercial banks and third-party payment processors. These entities provide a variety of treasury management services including providing depository accounts, transaction processing, merchant card processing, cash management and ACH processing. We rely on commercial banks to receive and clear deposits, provide cash for our store locations, perform wire transfers and ACH transactions and process debit card transactions. We rely on the ACH system to deposit loan proceeds into customer bank accounts and to electronically withdraw authorized payments from those accounts. It has been reported that the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"), as well as other federal regulators, have taken or threatened actions, commonly referred to as \u201cOperation Choke Point,\u201d intended to discourage banks and other financial services providers from providing access to banking and third-party payment processing services to lenders in our industry. We can give no assurances that actions akin to Operation Choke Point will not intensify or resume, or that the effect of such actions against banks and/or third-party payment processors will not pose a future threat to our ability to maintain relationships with commercial banks and third-party payment processors. The failure or inability of retail banks and/or third-party payment providers to continue to provide services to us could adversely affect our operations if we are unable or unsuccessful in replacing those providers with comparable service providers.\nPublic perception of our business and products as being predatory or abusive could negatively affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nNegative public perception that the consumer loans and other alternative financial services provided by us are predatory and abusive could negatively affect demand for our products and services. Widespread adoption of this perception could potentially have negative consequences for our business or our products, including lawsuits, adverse legislative or regulatory changes, difficulty attracting and retaining qualified employees, decreased demand for our products and services and reluctance or refusal\nof other parties, such as banks or other electronic payment processors, to transact business with us. These consequences could have a material adverse impact on our business and result in a significant decrease in our revenues and results of operations.\nImproper disclosure of customer personal data, including by means of a cyber-attack, could result in liability and harm our reputation. Cybersecurity risks and security breaches, in general, could result in increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks and to respond to cyber incidents.\nWe store and process large amounts of personally identifiable information, including data that is considered sensitive customer information. We believe that we maintain adequate policies and procedures, including antivirus and malware software and access controls, and use appropriate safeguards to protect against attacks. It is possible that our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information. Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.\nIn addition, we are subject to cybersecurity risks and security breaches, which could result in the unauthorized disclosure or appropriation of customer data. We may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against these types of security breaches, especially because the techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may increase our expenses, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants. It is also possible that our protective measures would fail to prevent a cyber-attack and the resulting disclosure or appropriation of customer data. A significant data breach could harm our reputation, diminish our customer confidence and subject us to significant legal claims, any of which may contribute to a loss of customers and have a material adverse effect on us.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our systems could cause serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of our confidential information or that of our customers or damage to our computers or systems or those of our customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, our applicants provide personal information, including bank account information when applying for loans. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including customer bank account and other personal information. The technology used by us to protect transaction data may be breached or compromised due to advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments. Data breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues.\nOur servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, including \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d type attacks. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Security breaches, including any breach of our systems or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of consumers\u2019 personal information, could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. In addition, many of the third parties who provide products, services or support to us could also experience any of the above cyber risks or security breaches, which could impact our customers and our business and could result in a loss of customers, suppliers or revenues.\nIn addition, federal and some state regulators are considering promulgating rules and standards to address cybersecurity risks and many U.S. states have already enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach are costly to implement and may lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures.\nIf we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required to operate and grow our business or if we are required to substantially increase our labor costs to attract and retain qualified employees, our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur continued growth and future success will depend on our ability to retain members of our senior management team, who possess valuable knowledge of, and experience with, the legal and regulatory environment of our industry, who have experience operating in our markets and who have been instrumental in developing our strategic plans and procuring capital to enable the pursuit of those plans. The loss of the services of one or more members of senior management and our inability to attract new skilled management could harm our business and future development. We do not maintain any key man insurance policies with respect to any senior management or employees.\nLabor costs represent a significant portion of our total expenses. If we are required to substantially increase our labor costs to attract or retain a sufficient number of qualified employees for our current operations, we may not be able to operate our business in a cost-effective manner. We also believe having experienced employees and staff continuity in our stores is an important contributor to the success of our business. If we were unable to retain our experienced managers and staff, it could adversely affect our customer service and our loan volume could suffer.\nAdverse real estate market conditions or zoning restrictions may result in increased operating costs or a reduction in new store development, which could adversely affect our profitability and growth plans.\nWe lease all of our store locations. An increase in lease costs, property taxes or maintenance costs for lease renewals or new store locations could result in increased operating costs for these locations, thereby negatively impacting the stores\u2019 operating margins.\nA recent trend among some municipalities in the U.S. and Canada has been to enact zoning restrictions in certain markets. These zoning restrictions may limit the number of payday lending stores that can operate in an area or require certain distance requirements between such stores and competitors or other uses such as residential or schools. These restrictions may make it more difficult to find suitable locations for future expansion, thereby negatively affecting our growth plans.\nWeather-related events, other natural disasters, man-made events or health emergencies could have an adverse impact on our business or the economy as a whole, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe operate stores across the U.S. and Canada and some of these regions have experienced weather events including tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war and similar events. The nature and level of these events and the impact of global climate change upon their frequency and severity cannot be predicted. If large scale events occur, they may significantly impact our customers\u2019 ability to repay their loans and cause other negative impacts on our ability to conduct business. Our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate for losses that may occur. Similarly, acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest, violence or human error could cause disruptions to our business or the economy as a whole. Any of these events could also cause consumer confidence to decrease which could negatively impact demand and result in less volume and, in turn, less revenue.\nIn addition, a widespread health emergency, such as the current novel coronavirus outbreak, and perceptions regarding its broad impact may increasingly negatively affect the North American and global economy, travel, employment levels, employee productivity, demand for and repayment of our loan products and other macroeconomic activities, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Given the dynamic nature of the novel coronavirus outbreak, however, the extent to which it may impact our results of operations or financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.\nWe rely on trademark protection to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors.\nWe rely on trademark protection to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors. We have registered various trademarks, including \u201cSpeedy Cash\u00ae,\u201d \u201cRapid Cash\u00ae,\u201d \"Cash Money\u00ae,\" \u201cThe Money Box\u00ae,\u201d \u201cOPT+\u00ae,\u201d \"Revolve Finance\u00ae,\" \"AVIO Credit\u00ae\" and \"LendDirect\u00ae\" in the U.S. and/or Canada, and are in the process of registering other trademarks in those jurisdictions. For trademarks we use that are not registered, and as permitted by applicable local law, we rely on common law trademark protection. Third parties may oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks, and may be able to use our trademarks in jurisdictions where they are not registered or otherwise protected by law. If our trademarks are successfully challenged or if a third party is using confusingly similar or identical trademarks in particular jurisdictions before we do, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote additional resources to marketing new brands. If others are able to use our trademarks, our ability to distinguish our products may be impaired, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe failure to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses into our operations could negatively affect our profitability.\nFrom time-to-time, we may consider opportunities to acquire other products or technologies that may enhance our product platform or technology, expand the breadth of our markets or customer base or advance our business strategies. The success of the acquisitions we have completed, as well as future acquisitions is, and will continue to be, dependent upon our ability to effectively integrate the management, operations and technology of acquired businesses into our existing management, operations and technology platforms. Integration can be complex, expensive and time-consuming. The failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our organization in a timely and cost-effective manner could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. It is also possible that the integration process could result in loss of key employees,\ndisruption of ongoing businesses, incurrence of tax costs or inefficiencies or inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures and policies. As a result, our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees or other third-parties or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions could be adversely affected and harm our financial performance. We do not know if we will be able to identify acquisitions we deem suitable, whether we will be able to successfully complete any such acquisitions on favorable terms or at all or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired products or technologies. Additionally, an additional risk inherent in any acquisition is that we fail to realize a positive return on our investment.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, or our employees, have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at other financial technology companies, including our competitors or potential competitors, and we may hire employees in the future that are so employed. We could in the future be subject to claims that these employees, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. If we fail in defending against such claims, a court could order us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from using technologies or features that are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. If any of these technologies or features are important to our products, this could prevent us from selling those products and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, such litigation could result in substantial costs and divert the attention of management.\nChanges in our ability to access preapproved marketing lists from credit bureaus or other developments impacting our use of direct mail marketing could adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nDirect mailings of preapproved loan offers to potential loan customers comprise one of the most important marketing channels for loans we originate as well as those originated by third-party lenders. Our marketing techniques identify candidates for preapproved loan mailings in part through the use of preapproved marketing lists purchased from credit bureaus. If access to such preapproved marketing lists were lost or limited due to regulatory changes prohibiting credit bureaus from sharing such information or for other reasons, our growth could be significantly and adversely affected. If the cost of obtaining such lists increases significantly, it could substantially increase customer acquisition costs and decrease profitability.\nSimilarly, federal or state regulators or legislators could limit access to these preapproved marketing lists with the same effect.\nIn addition, preapproved direct mailings may become a less effective marketing tool due to over-penetration of direct mailing-lists. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.\nBecause we maintain a significant supply of cash in our stores, we may be subject to cash shortages due to employee and third-party theft or errors. We also may be subject to liability as a result of crimes at our stores.\nOur business requires us to maintain a significant supply of cash in each of our stores. As a result, we are subject to the risk of cash shortages resulting from theft or errors by employees and third-parties. Although we have implemented various programs in an effort to reduce these risks, maintain insurance coverage for theft and utilize various security measures at our facilities, it is possible that employee and third-party theft or errors will occur in material amounts. Cash shortages from employee and third-party theft or errors were $0.5 million (0.05% of consolidated revenue) and $0.6 million (0.06% of consolidated revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The extent of our cash shortages could increase as we expand the nature and scope of our products and services. Although we have experienced break-ins by third parties at our stores in the past, none of these has had, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our operations. Going forward, theft or errors could lead to cash shortages and could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. It is also possible that violent crimes such as armed robberies may be committed at our stores. We could experience liability or adverse publicity arising from such crimes. For example, we may be liable if an employee, customer or bystander suffers bodily injury or other harm. Any such event may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Relating to the Regulation of Our Industry\nThe CFPB authority over our U.S. consumer lending business could have a significant impact on our U.S. business.\nUnder Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, the CFPB regulates U.S. consumer financial products and services, including consumer loans offered by us. The CFPB has regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers over providers of consumer financial products and services, including explicit supervisory authority to examine and require registration of providers such as us.\nThe CFPB has examined our lending products, services and practices, and we expect to continue to be examined on a regular basis by the CFPB. The CFPB\u2019s examination authority permits CFPB examiners to inspect the books and records of providers of short-term, small dollar loans, and ask questions about their business practices, and the examination procedures include specific modules for examining marketing activities; loan application and origination activities; payment processing activities and sustained use by consumers; collections, accounts in default and consumer reporting activities as well as third-party relationships. As a result of these examinations, we could be required to change our products, services or practices, whether as a result of another party being examined or as a result of an examination of us, or we could be subject to monetary penalties, which could materially adversely affect us.\nFurthermore, because the CFPB is a relatively new entity and its authority and activities appear to have been influenced by the political party in power, its practices and procedures regarding examination, enforcement and other matters relevant to us and other CFPB-regulated entities are subject to further development and change. Where the CFPB holds powers previously assigned to other regulators, the CFPB may not continue to apply such powers or interpret relevant concepts consistent with previous regulators\u2019 practice.\nThe CFPB also has broad authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices and to investigate and penalize financial institutions that violate this prohibition. In addition to having the authority to obtain monetary penalties for violations of applicable federal consumer financial laws (including the CFPB\u2019s own rules), the CFPB can require remediation of practices, pursue administrative proceedings or litigation and obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief). Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations implemented thereunder, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions to remedy violations. If the CFPB or one or more state attorneys general or state regulators believe that we have violated any of the applicable laws or regulations, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe CFPB promulgated new rules applicable to our loans that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe 2017 Final CFPB Rule includes Mandatory Underwriting Provisions and Payment Provisions. However, the 2019 Proposed CFPB Rule, if adopted in its current form, would rescind the Mandatory Underwriting Provisions. Moreover, the CFPB has adopted a rule delaying implementation of the Mandatory Underwriting Provisions until November 2020 and a federal district court in the Western District of Texas has entered an order (the \u201cCourt Order\u201d) staying the implementation of the entire 2017 Final CFPB Rule. See \"Business-Regulatory Environment and Compliance-U.S. Regulations-U.S. Federal Regulations-CFPB Rules\" for a description of these rules. We cannot provide assurance that the Mandatory Underwriting Provisions will be rescinded or, if they are rescinded, that litigation challenging such rescission will not be initiated and result in reinstatement of the Mandatory Underwriting Provisions.\nAt present, the Mandatory Underwriting Provisions include provisions that: (i) it is an unfair and abusive practice for a lender to make a covered short-term or longer-term balloon-payment loan, including our payday and vehicle title loans with a term of 45 days or less, without reasonably determining that consumers have the ability to repay those loans according to their terms; (ii) prescribe mandatory underwriting requirements for making this ability-to-repay determination; (iii) exempt certain loans from the mandatory underwriting requirements; and (iv) establish related definitions, reporting and recordkeeping requirements. In its Fall 2019 Rulemaking Agenda, the CFPB announced plans to issue a Final Rule in April 2020 with respect to the 2019 Proposed CFPB Rule to rescind the Mandatory Underwriting Provisions.\nWe believe that complying with the Mandatory Underwriting Provisions of the 2017 Final CFPB Rule would be costly, and would significantly reduce the permitted borrowings by individual consumers. Accordingly, unless they are declared invalid in the Texas litigation, rescinded or substantially revised as a result of the 2019 Proposed CFPB Rule or other rulemaking, the Mandatory Underwriting Provisions would likely have a substantial adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. We are unable to predict whether and when the 2017 Final CFPB Rule or 2019 Proposed CFPB Rule will go into effect and, if so, whether\nand how they might be further modified. Accordingly, we cannot predict the impact on our business, if any, of the Mandatory Underwriting Provisions.\nIn addition to its Mandatory Underwriting Provisions, the 2017 CFPB Final Rule contained Payment Provisions that would also have a significant impact on our business if they were to go into effect in their present form. The CFPB has not proposed to modify or delay implementation of the Payment Provisions, which were originally scheduled to go into effect on August 19, 2019. However, the Court Order indefinitely stays implementation of the entire 2017 Final CFPB Rule, including the Payment Provisions. The court has continued its stay of the 2017 Final CFPB Rule a number of times. The parties in the litigation are required to file a Joint Status Report with the court no later than April 24, 2020 and there can be no assurance that the court will keep the stay in force or, if so, how long it will do so.\nThe Payment Provisions would apply to short-term consumer loans, longer-term balloon payment consumer loans and longer-term loans with annual percentage rates exceeding 36% and leveraged payment mechanisms affording the lender access to funds in an asset account of the consumer. Under the Payment Provisions:\n\u2022\nIf two consecutive attempts to collect money from a particular account of the borrower, made through any channel (e.g., paper check, ACH, prepaid card) are returned for insufficient funds, the lender cannot make any further attempts to collect from such account unless the borrower has provided a new and specific authorization for additional payment transfers. The 2017 Final Rule contains specific requirements and conditions for the authorization. While the CFPB has explained that these provisions are designed to limit bank penalty fees to which consumers may be subject, and while banks do not charge penalty fees on debit card authorization requests, the 2017 Final Rule nevertheless treats card authorization requests as payment attempts subject to these limitations. While the CFPB has indicated it has received a formal request to revisit the treatment of debit cards under the Payment Provisions, it has not done so to date. If the CFPB determines that further action is warranted, it would likely need to commence a separate rulemaking initiative.\n\u2022\nA lender generally must give the consumer at least three business days advance notice before attempting to collect payment by accessing a consumer\u2019s checking, savings or prepaid account. The notice must include information such as the date of the payment request, payment channel and payment amount (broken down by principal, interest, fees and other charges), as well as additional information for \u201cunusual attempts,\u201d such as when the payment is for a different amount than the regular payment, initiated on a date other than the date of a regularly scheduled payment or initiated in a different channel than the immediately preceding payment attempt. A lender must also provide the borrower with a \"consumer rights notice\" in a CFPB-prescribed form after two consecutive failed payment attempts.\nWe believe that complying with the Payment Provisions of the 2017 Final Rule would require significant modifications to our payment, customer notification and compliance systems and create delays in initiating automated collection attempts when payments we initiate are initially unsuccessful. These modifications would increase costs and reduce revenues, albeit to a far lesser extent than the Mandatory Underwriting Provisions. Accordingly, unless the Payment Provisions are declared invalid in the Texas litigation, substantially revised or eliminated by future rulemaking, they could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nEven in advance of the effective date of the 2017 Final CFPB Rule (and even if the 2017 Final CFPB Rule does not become effective), it is possible that we may make further changes to our payment practices in a manner that will increase costs and/or reduce revenues.\nOur industry is strictly regulated everywhere we operate. Existing and new laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to substantial regulation everywhere we operate. In the U.S. and Canada, our business is subject to a variety of statutes and regulations enacted by government entities at the federal, state, provincial, and municipal levels. These regulations affect our business in many ways, and include regulations relating to:\n\u2022\nthe amount we may charge in interest rates and fees;\n\u2022\nthe terms of our loans (such as maximum and minimum durations), repayment requirements and limitations, number and frequency of loans, maximum loan amounts, renewals and extensions, required repayment plans and reporting and use of state-wide databases;\n\u2022\nunderwriting requirements;\n\u2022\ncollection and servicing activity, including initiation of payments from consumer accounts;\n\u2022\nthe establishment and operation of CSOs or CABs;\n\u2022\nlicensing, reporting and document retention;\n\u2022\nunfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices;\n\u2022\ndiscrimination;\n\u2022\ndisclosures, notices, advertising and marketing;\n\u2022\nloans to members of the military and their dependents;\n\u2022\nrequirements governing electronic payments, transactions, signatures and disclosures;\n\u2022\ncheck cashing;\n\u2022\nmoney transmission;\n\u2022\ncurrency and suspicious activity recording and reporting;\n\u2022\nprivacy and use of personally identifiable information and consumer data, including credit reports;\n\u2022\nanti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing requirements, including currency and suspicious transaction recording and reporting;\n\u2022\nposting of fees and charges; and\n\u2022\nrepossession practices in certain jurisdictions where we operate as a title lender, including requirements regarding notices and prompt remittance of excess proceeds for the sale of repossessed automobiles.\nThese regulations, which are outside of our control, affect our business in many ways, including affecting the loans and other products we can offer, the prices we can charge, the other terms of our loans and other products, the customers to whom we are allowed to lend, how we obtain our customers, how we communicate with our customers, how we pursue repayment of our loans and many others. Consequently, these restrictions adversely affect our loan volume, revenues, delinquencies and other aspects of our business, including our results of operations.\nIn recent years, lending laws were adopted in California, Ohio and Colorado with a significant adverse impact on our business. Virginia appears close to enacting a law that will adversely impact our business. See \u201cRegulatory Environment and Compliance-U.S. Regulations-U.S. State and Local Regulations-Recent and Potential Future Changes in the Law.\u201d In particular, in October 2019, California Governor Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 539, which, effective January 1, 2020, imposed an interest rate cap on all consumer loans between $2,500 and $10,000 of 36% plus the Federal Funds Rate. While this law does not affect our Single-Pay lending in California, it makes it impossible for us to offer our pre-existing Installment loan product in California. Revenue from California Unsecured and Secured Installment loans amounted to 8.9% and 3.3%, respectively, of total revenue from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. We continue to evaluate the effect on our results of operations or financial condition as a result of this bill and whether alternatives are available to service customers in the California market. There can be no assurance that we will be able to implement a strategy to replace our California installment loans or, if we do, that we will be able to avoid or surmount any legal attacks on any such strategy. If we are unsuccessful in managing the transition of our California business and operations from affected Installment loans to alternative products, Assembly Bill 539 could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition to the adverse changes in lending laws in recent years, in 2018, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) was passed into law, effective January 1, 2020. CCPA broadens consumer rights with respect to personal information, imposing expanded obligations to disclose the categories and uses of personal information a business collects and providing consumers a right to access that information, a right to opt out of the sale of personal information and a right to request that a business delete personal information about the consumer subject to certain exemptions. CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches, which may increase the costs of data breach litigation. CCPA has been subject to a handful of amendments, of which AB 25, which is scheduled to sunset in January 2021, has the greatest impact on us. AB 25 excludes employees from most CCPA rights, other than the right to notice at or before the point of collection about the categories of personal information to be collected and the purposes for which the categories of personal information shall be used and a private right of action for data breach. A potential ballot initiative may have additional impact should it make it to the polls in November 2020. Despite amendments and regulations, the CCPA remains ambiguous in many regards, and we anticipate further amendments both for the CCPA generally and specifically addressing employee data next year. Other states and possibly the federal government may adopt laws similar to the CCPA. While it is too early to know its full impact, these developments could ultimately result in the imposition of requirements on us and other consumer financial service providers, as well as the business community at large, that could increase costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to adhere to applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, civil penalties and other relief that could have a material adverse effect our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe governmental entities that regulate our business have the ability to sanction us and obtain redress for violations of these regulations, either directly or through civil actions, in a variety of different ways, including:\n\u2022\nordering remedial or corrective actions, including changes to compliance systems, product terms and other business operations;\n\u2022\nimposing fines or other monetary penalties, including for substantial amounts;\n\u2022\nordering the payment of restitution, damages or other amounts to customers, including multiples of the amounts charged;\n\u2022\nrequiring disgorgement of revenues or profits from certain activities;\n\u2022\nimposing cease and desist orders, including orders requiring affirmative relief, targeting specific business activities;\n\u2022\nsubjecting our operations to additional regulatory examinations during a remediation period;\n\u2022\nrevoking licenses required to operate in particular jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nordering the closure of one or more stores; and\n\u2022\nother impactful consequences.\nAccordingly, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe regulatory environment in which we operate is very complex, which increases our costs of compliance and the risk that we may fail to comply in ways that could have a material adverse effect our business.\nThe regulatory environment in which we operate is very complex, with applicable regulations being enacted by multiple agencies at each level of government. Accordingly, our regulatory requirements, and consequently, the actions we must take to comply with regulations, vary considerably among the many jurisdictions where we operate. Managing this complex regulatory environment is difficult and requires considerable compliance efforts. It is costly to operate in this environment, and it is possible that our costs of compliance will increase materially over time. This complexity also increases the risks that we will fail to comply with regulations in a way that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nCurrent and future legal, class action and administrative proceedings directed toward our industry or us may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nWe have been the subject of administrative proceedings and lawsuits, as well as class actions, in the past, and may be involved in future proceedings, lawsuits or other claims. For example, we are currently involved in litigation against the City of Austin, Texas, discussed in \u201c-Existing or new local regulation of our industry could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition\u201d below, as well as a putative class action in California where the plaintiffs have asserted that the interest rates on our former Installment loans are unconscionable. Other companies in our industry have also been subject to regulatory proceedings, class action lawsuits and other litigation regarding the offering of consumer loans. We could be adversely affected by interpretations of federal, state, provincial and municipal laws in those legal and regulatory proceedings, even if we are not a party to those proceedings. We anticipate that lawsuits and enforcement proceedings involving our industry, and potentially involving us, will continue to be brought in the future.\nWe may incur significant expenses associated with the defense or settlement of current or future lawsuits, the potential exposure for which is uncertain. The adverse resolution of legal or regulatory proceedings, whether by judgment or settlement, could force us to refund fees and interest collected, refund the principal amount of advances, pay damages or monetary penalties or modify or terminate our operations in particular local, state, provincial or federal jurisdictions. The defense of such legal proceedings, even if successful, requires significant time and attention from our senior officers and other management personnel that would otherwise be spent on other aspects of our business, and requires the expenditure of substantial amounts for legal fees and other related costs. Settlement of proceedings may also result in significant cash payouts, foregoing future revenues and modifications to our operations. Additionally, an adverse judgment or settlement in a lawsuit or regulatory proceeding could in certain circumstances provide a basis for the termination, non-renewal, suspension or denial of a license required for us to do business in a particular jurisdiction (or multiple jurisdictions). A sufficiently serious violation of law in one jurisdiction or with respect to one product could have adverse licensing consequences in other jurisdictions and/or with respect to other products. Thus, legal and enforcement proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, future results of operations, financial condition or our ability to service our debt obligations.\nExisting or new local regulation of our industry could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nIn recent years, a number of local laws have been passed by municipalities that regulate aspects of our business. For example, a number of municipalities have sought to use zoning and occupancy regulations to limit consumer lending storefronts. If additional local laws are passed that affect our business, this could materially restrict our business operations, increase our compliance costs or exacerbate the risks associated with the complexity of our regulatory environment.\nNearly 60 different Texas municipalities have enacted ordinances that regulate aspects of products offered under our CAB programs, including loan sizes and repayment terms. The Texas ordinances have forced us to make substantial changes to the loan products we offer and have resulted in litigation initiated by the City of Austin challenging the terms of our modified loan products. We believe that: (i) the Austin ordinance (like its counterparts elsewhere in the state) conflicts with Texas state law and (ii) our product in any event complies with the ordinance, when it is properly construed. The Austin Municipal Court agreed with our position that the ordinance conflicts with Texas law and, accordingly, did not address our second argument. In September 2017, however, the Travis County court reversed this decision and remanded the case to the Municipal Court for further proceedings consistent with its opinion (including, presumably, a decision on our second argument). To date, a hearing and trial on the merits has not been scheduled. Accordingly, we do not expect to have a final determination of the lawfulness of our CAB program under the Austin ordinance (and similar ordinances in other Texas cities) for some time. An adverse final decision could potentially result in material monetary liability in Austin and possibly other cities and would force us to restructure the loans we arrange in Texas. There can be no assurance that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation.\nThe regulations to which we are subject change from time-to-time, and future changes, including some that have been proposed, could restrict us in ways that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe laws and regulations to which we are subject change from time-to-time, and there has been a general increase in the volume and burden of laws and regulations that apply to us in the jurisdictions in which we operate, at the federal, state, provincial and municipal levels. For example, the 2017 CFPB Final Rule could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations if and to the extent it goes into effect, and recent changes in California, Ohio, Colorado and Texas municipal law have adversely affected our business. See \u201cBusiness -Regulatory Environment and Compliance-U.S. Regulations-U.S. State and Local Regulations-Recent and Potential Future Changes in the Law.\u201d We describe certain proposed laws and regulations that could apply to our business in greater detail under \u201cBusiness\u201d in this Annual Report.\nWe, along with others in the short-term consumer loan industry, intend to continue to inform and educate federal, state and local legislators and regulators and to oppose legislative or regulatory actions and ballot initiatives that would prohibit or severely restrict short-term consumer loans. Nevertheless, if changes in law with that effect were taken nationwide or in states in which we have a significant number of stores, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nIn Canada, most of the provinces have proposed or enacted legislation or regulations that limit the amount that lenders offering Single-Pay loans may charge or that limit certain business practices of Single-Pay lenders. Some provinces have also proposed or enacted legislation or regulations that impose a higher regulatory burden on Installment loans or Open-End loans that are determined to be \u201chigh cost.\u201d\nWe expect that the interest in increasing the regulation of our industry will continue. It is possible that the laws and regulations currently proposed, or other future laws and regulations, will be enacted and will adversely affect our pricing, product mix, compliance costs or other business activities in a way that is detrimental to our results of operations or financial condition.\nJudicial decisions or new legislation could potentially render our arbitration agreements unenforceable.\nWe include pre-dispute arbitration provisions in our loan agreements. These provisions are designed to allow us to resolve any customer disputes through individual arbitration rather than in court. Our arbitration provisions explicitly provide that all arbitrations will be conducted on an individual and not on a class basis. Thus, our arbitration agreements, if enforced, have the effect of shielding us from class action liability.\nOur use of pre-dispute arbitration provisions will remain dependent on whether courts continue to enforce these provisions. We take the position that the Federal Arbitration Act (the \u201cFAA\u201d) requires that arbitration agreements containing class action waivers of the type we use be enforced in accordance with their terms. In the past, a number of courts, including the California and Nevada Supreme Courts, have concluded that arbitration agreements with class action waivers are \u201cunconscionable\u201d and hence unenforceable, particularly where a small dollar amount is in controversy on an individual basis. However, in April 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision in AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion held that the FAA preempts state laws that would otherwise invalidate consumer arbitration agreements with class action waivers. Our arbitration agreements differ in some respects from the agreement at issue in Concepcion, and some courts have continued to find reasons to find arbitration agreements unenforceable following the Concepcion decision. For example, in McGill v. Citibank, N.A., the California Supreme Court denied Citibank\u2019s motion to compel arbitration on the ground that the arbitration agreement impermissibly barred the plaintiffs from pursuing claims for public injunctive relief in court or in arbitration. Based on McGill, the federal district court in the Southern District of California refused to grant CURO\u2019s motion to compel arbitration of a complaint against us seeking class and public injunction relief due to allegedly unconscionable interest rates on our loans. Defendants in other cases addressing this issue are seeking a hearing in the U.S. Supreme Court but there can be no assurance that the U.S. Supreme Court will agree to hear the\ncase or, if it does, that it will rule in favor of the defendants and enforce their arbitration agreements. Further, it is possible that anti-arbitration legislation could be enacted by Congress, particularly if a Democrat is elected President and Democrats assume control over both Houses of Congress. If our arbitration agreements are finally held to be unenforceable or were to become unenforceable for some reason, our costs to litigate and settle customer disputes could increase and we could face class action lawsuits, with a potential material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nNew product offerings could potentially lead to litigation and monetary exposure.\nWe are testing in two states and considering in other states a new installment loan program with Stride Bank where we will act as marketing and servicing agent for Stride Bank and acquire participation interests in Stride Bank\u2019s loans. This program relies on federal laws that authorize banks to export nationwide the interest charges allowed by the laws of the state where the bank is located, without regard to more restrictive interest rates of the state where the borrower resides. Thus, we believe that the Stride program may allow us to continue servicing customers in certain states that have adopted new restrictions on interest charges programs, and even to serve customers in states that have traditionally restricted interest charges to low levels.\nIf we expand the Stride Bank program on a large-scale basis, we will need to accept associated legal risks. This is because similar programs have resulted in lawsuits and enforcement proceedings in the past, with mixed results. Some cases have concluded that, in substance, the bank\u2019s marketing and servicing agent and not the bank is the \u201ctrue lender.\u201d For the most part, cases reaching this conclusion have focused on the circumstance that the bank\u2019s marketing and servicing agent acquired the \u201cpredominant economic interest\u201d in the loans. If so, the usury laws of the borrower\u2019s state, rather than the laws of the bank\u2019s state, will apply. Additionally, the Madden case, decided by the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, has suggested that, even if the bank is the \u201ctrue lender,\u201d its sale of loans to a nonbanking entity might result in application of the borrower\u2019s usury law. For example the State of Colorado is currently litigating these issues in two lawsuits involving programs with APRs limited to 36% which is lower than the rates we expect under the Stride Bank program.\nStride Bank and CURO intend to expand the Stride Bank program, which will inherently entail significant legal risk, including defense costs, attempts to impose potentially severe monetary sanctions or penalties, possible requirements to void loans and other material adverse effects on our results of operations or financial condition.\nA change in the United States' presidential administration and/or composition of Congress in the upcoming 2020 election could result in new legislation, rules and regulatory and enforcement policies with a substantial adverse impact on our business.\nThe upcoming election could result in a new administration and/or Congress hostile to our business or with policies that could adversely impact our business.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Common Stock\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results, which would cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have provided in the past and may provide guidance in the future about our business and future operating results. In developing this guidance, our management must make certain assumptions and judgment about our future performance, including projected revenues, key consumer trends such as allowance and the timing of regulatory approvals. Furthermore, analysts and investors may develop and publish their own projections of our business, which may form a consensus about our future performance. The assumptions used or judgment applied to our current operations to project future operating and financial results may be inaccurate and could result in a material reduction in the price of our common stock, which we have experienced in the past. Our business results may also vary significantly from our guidance or our analyst\u2019s consensus due to a number of factors which are outside of our control and which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. Furthermore, if we make downward revisions of our previously announced guidance or if our publicly announced guidance of future operating results fails to meet expectations of securities analysts, investors or other interested parties, the price of our common stock could decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about our business. If one or more of the security or industry analysts that covers us downgrades our shares or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our shares could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nA majority of our outstanding shares of common stock are held by a relatively small number of our stockholders. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our significant stockholders or pursuant to new issuances by us, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had 41,156,224 shares of our common stock outstanding, of which 24,518,901 shares are held by our affiliates and subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2019, holders of a majority of approximately 27,960,522 shares, or 67.9%, of our outstanding common stock have registration rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders in the future.\nYour ownership interest in us could rank junior to and be diluted by future offerings of debt or equity securities. Similarly, your ownership interest in us will be diluted by future awards or exercises of outstanding stock options under our equity incentive plans.\nIf we issue debt securities in the future, which would rank senior to shares of our common stock, it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. We and, indirectly, our stockholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. We could also issue preferred equity, which would have superior rights relative to our common stock, including with respect to voting and liquidation.\nFurthermore, if we raise additional capital by issuing new convertible or equity securities at a lower price than the initial public offering price, your interest will be diluted. This may result in the loss of all or a portion of your investment. If our future access to public markets is limited or our performance decreases, we may need to carry out a private placement or public offering of our common stock at a lower price than the initial public offering price.\nBecause our decision to issue debt, preferred or other equity or equity-linked securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their shareholdings in us.\nSimilarly, any future awards of equity to our employees and the exercise of outstanding stock options by employees will dilute your ownership interest in us. As of December 31, 2019, we had options outstanding that, if fully exercised, would result in the issuance of approximately 1,404,622 shares of our common stock. All of the shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of options have been registered under the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance as permitted by any applicable vesting requirements, except for shares held by affiliates, who will be subject to the resale restrictions under the Securities Act.\nWe are currently subject to a securities class action lawsuit, the unfavorable outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nIn December 2018, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against us and our chief executive officer, chief financial officer and chief operating officer. While we are, and will continue to, vigorously contest this lawsuit, we cannot determine the final resolution of the lawsuit or when it might be resolved. In addition to the expenses incurred in defending this litigation and any damages that may be awarded in the event of an adverse ruling, our management\u2019s efforts and attention may be diverted from the ordinary business operations to address these claims. Regardless of the outcome, this litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results because of defense costs, including costs related to our indemnification obligations, diversion of\nresources and other factors. We discuss this lawsuit further in Note 16, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe stock market is highly volatile. As a result, the market price and trading volume for our common stock may also be highly volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. Factors that could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly include:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance and prospects and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nconditions that impact demand for our products and services;\n\u2022\nour ability to accurately forecast our financial results;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, financial guidance and other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities or research analysts who track our common stock;\n\u2022\nmarket and industry perception of our level of success in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in government and other regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\narrival or departure of members of senior management or other key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe number of shares that are publicly traded;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by us, our investors or members of our management team;\n\u2022\nfactors affecting the industry in which we operate, including competition, innovation, regulation, the economy and other factors; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general market, economic and political conditions in the U.S. and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, health emergencies (such as the recent outbreak of coronavirus), telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, civil unrest in various parts of the world, acts of war, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events.\nAny of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the trading volume and market price of our common stock and may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nFollowing periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders may file securities class action lawsuits against a company. Our involvement in a class action lawsuit, such as the lawsuit described above in \u201c--We are currently subject to a securities class action lawsuit, the unfavorable outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows,\" could be costly to defend and divert our senior management\u2019s attention and, if adversely determined, could involve substantial damages that may not be covered by insurance.\nOur common stock has relatively low trading volume and an active trading market for our common stock may not develop, which could further depress the market price for our common stock.\nOur common stock is relatively thinly traded and our average daily trading volume is relatively low compared to the number of shares of common stock that are outstanding. The low trading volume of our common stock can cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly as well as make it more difficult for a stockholder to sell their shares of common stock quickly. As a result of our stock being thinly traded and/or current levels of our stock price, institutional investors might not be interested in owning our common stock. Given the limited trading history of our common stock, an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could adversely impact your ability to sell your shares of common stock and could depress the market price of those shares.\nFriedman Fleischer & Lowe Capital Partners II, L.P. and its affiliated investment funds (\"FFL Holders\") and the original founders of the company (\"Founder Holders\") together own more than 50% of our common stock, and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future.\nAt December 31, 2019, FFL Holders and Founder Holders owned approximately 11.8% and 47.7%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock. As a result, the FFL Holders and the Founder Holders collectively have the ability to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors and thereby control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on our common stock, the incurrence or modification of debt by us, certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, and the entering into of extraordinary transactions, and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with your interests. In\naddition, the FFL Holders together with Founder Holders may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in their respective judgment, could enhance their investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you. For example, the FFL Holders together with the Founder Holders could cause us to make acquisitions that increase our indebtedness or cause us to sell revenue-generating assets.\nIn connection with the completion of our IPO, we entered into the Amended and Restated Investors Rights Agreement with certain of our existing stockholders, including the Founder Holders and Freidman Fleisher & Lowe Capital Partners II, L.P. (and its affiliated funds, the \u201cFFL Funds\u201d), whom we collectively refer to as the principal holders. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Investors Rights Agreement, we have agreed to register the sale of shares of our common stock held by the stockholders party thereto under certain circumstances. We completed a registration pursuant to these registration rights in May 2018.\nThe FFL Holders are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time-to-time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us.\nWe have authorized, and may continue, to authorize share repurchase programs. We cannot guarantee that repurchases under this or other similar programs we may enter into in the future will enhance long-term stockholder value. Additionally, share repurchases could increase the volatility of the price of our stock and could diminish our cash reserves.\nIn April 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining available repurchase amount was $4.8 million. We fully utilized this program in February 2020.\nIn February 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $25.0 million of our common stock. See Note 24, \"Subsequent Events\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares. We may suspend or terminate our repurchase program at any time and, even if fully implemented, the program may not enhance long-term stockholder value. Also, the amount, timing, and execution of our share repurchase program will depend on a variety of factors, including our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes, changes in cash flows, tax laws and the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nCertain provisions in our governing documents could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us difficult, even if such events would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\npermit our Board of Directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our Board of Directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u2022\nprovide that our Board of Directors is expressly authorized to amend or repeal any provision of our bylaws;\n\u2022\nrestrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified Board of Directors with three staggered classes of directors, where directors may only be removed for cause (unless we de-classify our Board of Directors);\n\u2022\nrequire that actions to be taken by our stockholders be taken only at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders, and not by written consent; and\n\u2022\nestablish certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may delay or prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace members of our management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. These provisions also may delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their common stock. We believe these provisions will protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers or investors aiming to effect changes in management to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any proposal. However, such anti-takeover provisions could also depress the price of our common stock by acting to delay or prevent a change in control of us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits.\nAlthough our Board recently approved the payment of a quarterly cash dividend, the Board may determine in the future to reduce that dividend or pay no dividend at all on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment may depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nAny decision to declare and pay dividends will be dependent on a variety of factors, including earnings, cash flow generation, results of operations, financial condition, the terms of our indebtedness and other contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant. The terms of our indebtedness limits our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock. As a result, you should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income and the increase in value of your investment in our common stock may depend upon an appreciation in its value.", "PERMNO": 17178, "SIC": 6141, "TIC": "CURO"}
