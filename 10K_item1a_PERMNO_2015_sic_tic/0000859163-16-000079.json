{"cik": "859163", "company": "AVX Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-05-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\n\ufeff\nFrom time to time, information provided by us, including, but not limited to, statements in this report, or other statements made by us or on our behalf, may contain \u201cforward-looking\u201d information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, which may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated.\n\ufeff\nOur businesses routinely encounter and address risks, some of which will cause our future results to be different - sometimes materially different - than we presently anticipate. Discussion about the important operational risks that our businesses encounter can also be found in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We wish to caution the reader that the following important risk factors and those factors described elsewhere in this report or other documents that we file or furnish to the SEC could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in forward-looking statements contained in this document and elsewhere. Below, we have described our current view of certain important strategic risks. These risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Our reactions to material future developments as well as our competitors\u2019 reactions to those developments will impact our future results.\n\ufeff\nWe operate in a cyclical business, which could result in significant fluctuations in demand for our products\n\ufeff\nCyclical changes in our customers\u2019 businesses have resulted in, and may in the future result in, significant fluctuations in demand for our products, selling prices, and our resulting profitability. Most of our customers operate in cyclical industries. Their requirements for passive components and interconnect products fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in general economic conditions, technological changes, customer demand, and other factors. During periods of increasing demand our customers typically seek to increase their inventory of our products to avoid production bottlenecks. When demand for their products peaks and begins to decline, as has happened in the past, they tend to reduce or cancel orders for our products while they use up accumulated inventory. Business cycles vary somewhat in different geographical regions and customer industries. Significant fluctuations in sales of our products impact our unit manufacturing costs and impact our profitability by making it more difficult for us to predict our production, raw materials, and shipping needs. Changes in demand mix, needed technologies, and end-use markets may adversely affect our ability to match our products, inventory, and capacity to meet customer demand and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We are also vulnerable to general economic events or trends beyond our control, and our sales and profits may suffer in periods of weak demand.\n\ufeff\nWe must consistently reduce costs to remain competitive and to address downward price trends\n\ufeff\nTo remain competitive and to address the impact of potential downward price trends we must consistently reduce the total costs of our products. Our industry is intensely competitive, and prices for existing products tend to decrease over their life cycle. To remain competitive, we must achieve continuous cost reductions through process and material improvements. We must also be in a position to minimize our customers\u2019 inventory financing costs and to meet their other goals for supply chain management. In addition, as a result of our efforts to streamline manufacturing and logistics operations and to enhance operations in lower operating cost regions, we have incurred restructuring costs in the past and are likely to incur restructuring costs in the future in response to competitive pressures. If we are unsuccessful in implementing restructuring or other cost reduction plans, we may experience disruptions in our operations and incur higher ongoing costs, which may adversely affect our sales levels, financial condition, and operating results.\n\ufeff\nWe attempt to improve profitability by operating in countries in which operating costs are lower; but the shift of operations to these regions may entail considerable expense and risk\n\ufeff\nOur strategy is aimed at achieving significant production cost savings through the transfer to and expansion of manufacturing operations in countries with lower operating costs, such as the Czech Republic, Malaysia, Mexico, and El Salvador. During this process, we may experience under-utilization of certain plants and factories in higher-cost regions and capacity constraints in plants and factories located in lower-cost regions. This under-utilization may result initially in production inefficiencies and higher overall costs. These costs also include those associated with compensation in connection with work force reductions and plant closings in the higher-cost regions, and start-up expenses, equipment relocation costs, manufacturing and construction delays, and increased depreciation costs in connection with the initiation or expansion of production in lower-cost regions. In addition, as we implement transfers of certain of our operations, we may experience labor strikes or other types of disruption as a result of lay-offs or termination of our employees in higher-cost countries.\n\ufeff\nOur global operations subject us to many different and complex laws and rules\n\ufeff\nDue to our global operations, we are subject to many laws governing international relations (including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.S. Export Administration Act), which prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where and how we can do business, what information or products we can supply to certain countries, and what information we can provide to a non-U.S. government. Although we have procedures and policies in place that should mitigate the risk of violations of these laws, there is no guarantee that they will be sufficiently effective. If and when we acquire new businesses we may not be able to ensure that the pre-existing controls and procedures meant to prevent violations of the rules and laws were effective and we may not be able to implement effective controls and procedures to prevent violations quickly enough when integrating newly acquired businesses. Acquisitions of new businesses in new foreign jurisdictions may also subject us to new regulations and laws, and we may face difficulties ensuring compliance with these new requirements.\n\ufeff\nWe encounter competition in substantially all areas of our business\n\ufeff\nWe compete primarily on the basis of technology, product quality, price, sales terms, customer service, and delivery time. Competitors include large, diversified companies, some of which have substantial assets and financial resources, as well as medium to small companies. There can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter into our existing markets, nor can there be any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition.\n\ufeff\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, especially our design and technical personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively.\n\ufeff\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain, attract and motivate qualified personnel, including our management, sales and marketing, finance, and especially our design and technical personnel. As the source of our technological and product innovations, our design and technical personnel represent a significant asset. Any inability to retain, attract or motivate such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe must continue to develop new products and technology to remain competitive\n\ufeff\nMost of the fundamental technologies used in the passive components industry have been available for a long time. The market is nonetheless typified by rapid changes in product designs and technological advantages allowing for better performance and/or lower cost. New applications are frequently found for existing technologies, and new technologies occasionally replace existing technologies for some applications or open up new business opportunities in other areas of application. Successful innovation is critical for maintaining profitability in the face of potential erosion of selling prices for existing products. To address downward selling price pressure for our products and to meet market requirements, we must continue to develop innovative products and production techniques. Sustaining and improving our profitability depends a great deal on our ability to develop new products quickly and successfully meet changing customer specifications. Non-customized commodity products are especially vulnerable to price pressure, but customized products have also experienced price pressure over time. We have traditionally addressed downward pricing trends in part by offering products with new technologies or applications that offer our customers advantages over older products. We also seek to maintain profitability by developing products to our customers\u2019 specifications that are not readily available from competitors. Developing and marketing these products requires start-up costs that may not be recouped if those new products or production techniques are not successful. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands. If this occurs, we could lose customers and experience adverse effects on our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur operating results are sensitive to raw material and resale product availability, quality, and cost\n\ufeff\nMany of our products require the use of raw materials that are available from only a limited number of regions around the world, are available from only a limited number of suppliers, or may be subject to significant fluctuations in market prices. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, our key suppliers experience financial difficulties, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price increases for these raw materials. For example, the prices for tantalum, platinum, silver, nickel, gold, copper, palladium, and other raw materials that we use in the manufacture of our products are subject to fluctuation and have experienced significant variability in the past. Our inability to recover costs through increased sales prices could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. For periods in which the prices for these raw materials rise, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers, which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used. For periods in which margins are declining, we may be required, as has occurred in the past, to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials and products. Depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost, the write-down could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nFrom time to time there have been short-term market shortages of raw materials. While these shortages have not historically adversely affected our ability to increase production of products, they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for us. There can be no assurance that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect our ability to increase production, particularly during periods of growing demand for our products.\n\ufeff\nWe resell products manufactured by Kyocera, as well as other component and interconnect product manufacturers. Should these manufacturers experience difficulties in supplying the products that we resell, or such suppliers use other channels to market their products, we could experience lower sales which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur sales to distribution sales channel customers may fluctuate\n\ufeff\nSelling products to our customers in the electronic component distribution sales channel has associated risks, including, without limitation, that sales can be negatively impacted on a short-term basis as a result of changes in distributor inventory levels; these changes may be unrelated to the purchasing trends by the end customer. In the past, we have gone through cycles of inventory correction as distributors increase or decrease their supply chain inventories based upon their anticipated market needs and economic conditions.\n\ufeff\nOur backlog is subject to customer cancellation\n\ufeff\nWe generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers. Uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, some of our customers delaying the delivery of products that we manufacture for them and placing purchase orders for lower volumes of products than previously anticipated. Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be canceled by our customers without penalty. Our customers may, on occasion, order components from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when delivery lead times are particularly long and product delivery is a concern. They may cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive, a situation that we have experienced during periods of economic slowdown. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog does not exceed the level of sales that will ultimately be made. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog.\n\ufeff\nOur growth strategy may include growth through acquisitions, which may involve significant risks\n\ufeff\nWe may, from time to time, make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses as we believe such acquisitions can help to position us to take advantage of growth opportunities. Such acquisitions could introduce significant risks and uncertainties, including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses and achieving benefits from the acquisitions. More particularly, risks and uncertainties of an acquisition strategy could include: (1) difficulties in integrating newly-acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner; (2) challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings, and other benefits from acquisitions; (3) risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets; (4) potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses; (5) risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our operations; (6) risks of entering new markets in which we have limited experience; (7) risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems; (8) difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses; (9) future impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets of an acquired business; (10) unanticipated legal and regulatory issues in the jurisdictions of the acquired business; and (11) liabilities for activities of the acquired businesses, including environmental, tax, and other known and unknown liabilities.\n\ufeff\nChanges in our environmental liability and compliance obligations may adversely impact our operations or financial condition\n\ufeff\nOur manufacturing operations, products, and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions; wastewater discharges; the handling, disposal, and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes, and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing process; employee health and safety; labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products, or packaging; restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging; and responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging. We also operate on sites that may have potential future environmental issues as a result of activities at sites during the long history of manufacturing operations of AVX or its corporate predecessor, or prior to the start of operations by AVX. Even though we may have rights of indemnity for such environmental matters at certain sites, regulatory agencies in those jurisdictions may require us to address such issues. We establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities when the liabilities are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have an adverse impact on our operations or financial condition. In addition, more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations. In order to resolve liabilities at various sites, we have entered into various administrative orders and consent decrees, some of which may be, under certain conditions, reopened or subject to renegotiation. See \u201cEnvironmental Matters\u201d in Item 1 elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\ufeff\nChanges in regulatory compliance obligations may adversely impact our operations\n\ufeff\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank\u201d Act), signed into law on July 21, 2010, includes Section 1502, which requires the SEC to adopt additional disclosure requirements related to the source of certain \u201cconflict minerals\u201d for issuers for which such \u201cconflict minerals\u201d are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by that issuer. A final rule was issued by the SEC on August 22, 2012. The metals covered by the rules are commonly referred to as \u201c3TG\u201d and include tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold. We use many of these materials in our production processes. The rule requires companies to perform due diligence, disclose, and report whether or not such minerals originate from the DRC and adjoining countries. In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. Global supply chains are complicated with multiple layers and suppliers between the mine and the final product.\n\ufeff\nFor the ten years prior to our participation in \u201cSolutions for Hope\u201d, we had a policy of not using tantalum sourced from the DRC or any other area in which insurgents or similar groups benefit from the sale of minerals. We have conducted extensive supply chain investigations relating to tantalum and are a participant in \u201cSolutions for Hope\u201d, which is a program designed to ensure that tantalum sourced from the DRC does not finance or benefit armed groups in the DRC or adjoining countries. \u201cSolutions for Hope\u201d incorporates the independently-validated Conflict-Free Smelter program. As a result, AVX was the first in its industry to validate a \u201cclosed tantalum pipe\u201d process, assuring all tantalum products contain only tantalum from smelters that have been independently-verified under the Conflict Free Smelter program in accordance with the principles of the Dodd-Frank legislation and the current OECD guidelines.\n\ufeff\nSince December 2011, AVX has only sourced tantalum powder and wire used in its tantalum capacitors from smelters that are compliant with the EICC/GeSI conflict-free smelter program. In 2012, AVX began using Validated Conflict-Free Tantalum, which comes from verified sources in the DRC and surrounding countries.\n\ufeff\nOur participation in \u201cSolutions for Hope\u201d is intended to affirm our commitment to supply conflict-free minerals to our customers and to fully comply with the OECD guidelines and SEC regulations. The implementation of Rule 1502 has not had a material adverse effect on our ability to source raw materials or manufacture products containing the \u201c3TG\u201d metals. We filed our most recent Form SD with the SEC on May 28, 2015.\n\ufeff\nWe use significant amounts of electrical energy and processed ores in our production process. Although its status is uncertain, the Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement that purports to set binding targets for signatory industrialized countries for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Further, a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change including pending U.S. legislation that, if enacted, would limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a \u201ccap and trade\u201d system of allowances and credits, among other provisions. There is also current and emerging regulation in other countries in which we or our customers operate, such as the mandatory renewable energy target in Australia. Any significant, sustained increase in energy costs could result in increases in our capital expenditures, operating expenses, and costs of important raw materials resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe potential physical impacts of climate change on the company\u2019s operations are highly uncertain, and will be particular to the geographic circumstances. These effects may adversely impact the cost, production, and financial performance of our operations.\n\ufeff\nOur results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates\n\ufeff\nWe conduct business in several international currencies through our worldwide operations and, as a result, are subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Volatility in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect our sales, gross margins, and stockholder\u2019s equity. In order to minimize the effects of movements in currency exchange rates, we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge external and intercompany foreign currency transactions. In addition, we attempt to minimize currency exposure risk by producing our products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency. There can be no assurance that our approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of our worldwide operations. We do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes.\n\ufeff\nA significant portion of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries\n\ufeff\nWe generate a significant amount of cash and profits from our foreign subsidiaries. We expect that cash and profits generated by our foreign subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested indefinitely. However, liquidity requirements could necessitate transfers of existing cash balances between our subsidiaries which may be subject to restrictions or cause unfavorable tax or earnings consequences. Approximately 80% of our cash and investment securities are held by international subsidiaries. While we intend to use cash held overseas to fund our international operations and growth, if we encounter a significant need for liquidity domestically or at a particular location that we cannot fulfill through other internal or external sources, we may experience unfavorable tax and earnings consequences due to cash transfers. These adverse consequences would occur, for example, if the transfer of cash into the United States is taxed and no offsetting foreign tax credit is available to offset the U.S. tax liability, resulting in lower earnings. We do not provide for U.S. taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which are considered to be reinvested indefinitely. We expect to generate sufficient cash from our U.S. subsidiaries to meet our cash requirements.\n\ufeff\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by foreign operations\n\ufeff\nWe have significant international operations and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic, political, health, regulatory, and other circumstances existing in foreign countries in which we operate. International manufacturing and sales are subject to inherent risks, including production disruption by employee union or works council actions, changes in local economic or political conditions, the imposition of currency exchange restrictions, unexpected changes in regulatory environments, potentially adverse tax law changes, and the exchange rate risk discussed above. Further, we have operations, suppliers, and customers in countries that are in the Pacific Basin which may be more susceptible to certain natural disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis, and typhoons. Although we have operations around the world, a significant natural event could disrupt supply or production or significantly affect the market for some or all of our products. There can be no assurance that these factors will not have an adverse impact on our production capabilities or otherwise adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\ufeff\nOur products are subject to stringent specifications and operating tolerances\n\ufeff\nAll of our products are built to specifications and tested by us for adherence to such specifications before shipment to customers. We warrant that our products will meet such specifications. In the past, we have not incurred significant warranty claims. However, we have seen an increasing trend in the marketplace for claims related to end market product application failures or end-user recall or damage claims related to product defects, which could result in future claims that have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur ability to maintain our competitiveness depends, in part, on our maintaining the proprietorship of our technology\n\ufeff\nWe will protect our proprietary rights as long as our proprietary technologies are maintained as trade secrets or are covered by recognized patents. We properly apply for, and will continue applying for, patents covering our technologies. Each patent application may not result in a successful patent issuance. Competitors may develop similar, alternative, or new technologies which reduce the positive impact of our patents. In addition, competitors may challenge our patents, seek to invalidate them, or operate in certain countries who do not recognize our legal patent rights. The protection of intellectual property involves multiple legal and factual issues which makes the process difficult.\n\ufeff\nPatent and intellectual property rights litigation is prevalent in the electronic components industry. We have occasionally been advised that we are infringing on others\u2019 patent and intellectual property rights and have recently seen an aggressive posture within the electronic component industry to assert and defend patent claims. We will continue to vigorously defend our patent and intellectual property rights and may be involved in future litigation alleging our infringement of such rights from others. We will seek multiple remedies to resolve these claims, including the normal practice of the offering or purchasing of licenses, in an acceptable manner. An unfavorable outcome regarding these rights could have an adverse effect on our business and our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nFluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results\n\ufeff\nAlthough we have not recognized any material losses related to our cash equivalents, short-term investments, or long-term investments, future declines in the market values of such investments could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Given the global nature of our business, we have investments both domestically and internationally. Additionally, a portion of our overall investment portfolio includes investment securities in the financial sector. If the issuers of such investments default on their obligations or their credit ratings are negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other factors, the value of our cash equivalents, short-term investments, and long-term investments could decline and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. In addition, our ability to find investments that are both safe and liquid and that provide a reasonable return may be impaired. This could result in lower interest income and/or higher other-than-temporary impairments.\n\ufeff\nCredit risk on our accounts receivable could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results\n\ufeff\nOur outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. While we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on our trade receivables, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\n\ufeff\nCounterparty non-performance to derivative transactions could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results\n\ufeff\nWe evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have minimal credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several credit line banks. We carefully monitor the amount of exposure we have with any given bank. We also periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. In some cases, we have master netting agreements that help reduce the risk of counterparty exposures. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Nevertheless, a credit crisis could have an impact on our hedging contracts if our counterparties are forced to file for bankruptcy or are otherwise unable to perform their obligations. If we are required to terminate hedging contracts prior to their scheduled settlement dates, we may be required to recognize losses.\n\ufeff\nReturns on pension and retirement plan assets and interest rate changes could affect our earnings in future periods\n\ufeff\nThe funding position of our pension plans is impacted by the performance of the financial markets, and the discount rate used to calculate our pension obligations for funding and expense purposes. In the past, declines in the financial markets have negatively impacted the value of the assets in our defined benefit pension plans. In addition, lower bond yields may reduce our discount rates, resulting in increased pension contributions and expense.\n\ufeff\nFunding obligations are determined under government regulations and measured each year based on the value of the assets and liabilities on a specific date. If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected, we could be required to make larger contributions. The financial markets can be, and in the recent past have been, very volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change in relatively short periods of time. In a low interest rate environment, the likelihood of higher contributions in the future increases.\n\ufeff\nWe may not generate sufficient future taxable income, which may require additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets\n\ufeff\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our tax assets and liabilities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves management estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recoverable as a result of future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance.\n\ufeff\nWe have recorded valuation allowances due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize some of our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward before they expire. The valuation allowances are based on our estimates of future taxable income over the periods that our deferred tax assets will be recoverable.\n\ufeff\nWe also record a provision for certain international, federal, and state tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation, when needed. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges may result in adjustments of the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. Further, during the ordinary course of business, other changing facts and circumstances may impact our ability to utilize tax benefits as well as the estimated taxes to be paid in future periods. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we may need to adjust tax accounts and related payments, which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in the actual tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on future operating results.\n\ufeff\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology, and if we are unable to protect against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks, or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted\n\ufeff\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information; to manage a variety of business processes and activities; and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. We also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing and sales activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, and suppliers around the world. Many of the information technology systems used by the Company globally have been in place for many years and not all hardware and software is currently supported by vendors. These information technology systems are susceptible to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, or catastrophic events. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results.\nThird-party service providers, such as distributors, subcontractors, and vendors have access to certain portions of our sensitive data. In the event that these service providers do not appropriately protect our data, the result could be a security breach or loss of our data. Any such loss of data by our third-party service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, if we are unable to prevent security breaches, we may suffer financial and reputational damage or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our customers or suppliers. In addition, the disclosure of non-public sensitive information through external media channels could lead to the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation and brand image.\n\ufeff\nWe are also in the process of converting certain IP systems and consolidating certain global systems. If such projects fail, or if unexpected technical difficulties arise, our operations and financial systems could be adversely affected. Further, we could incur additional costs or require additional technical support to resolve such difficulties.\n\ufeff\nChanges in global geopolitical and general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control may adversely impact our business\n\ufeff\nThe following factors beyond our control could adversely impact our business:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nA global economic slowdown affecting any one, or all, of our markets.\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nRapid escalation of the cost of regulatory compliance and litigation.\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nUnexpected government policies and regulations affecting us or our significant customers\u2019 sales or production facilities.\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nUnforeseen regional conflicts or actions, including, but not limited to, armed conflict and trade wars that could impact us or our customers\u2019 production capabilities.\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nUnforeseen interruptions to our business with our significant customers and suppliers resulting from labor strikes, financial instabilities, computer malfunctions, environmental disruptions, natural disasters, or inventory excesses or other unforeseen events or circumstances.\n\ufeff\nWe operate in a continually changing business environment and new factors emerge from time to time. Other unknown and unpredictable factors also could have either adverse or positive effects on our future results of operations or financial condition.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 81912, "SIC": 3670, "TIC": "AVX"}
