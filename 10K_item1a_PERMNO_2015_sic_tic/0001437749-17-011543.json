{"cik": "719274", "company": "GIGA TRONICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-06-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nFuture liquidity is uncertain\nWe incurred net losses of $1.5 million in fiscal 2017, and $4.1 million in fiscal 2016. These losses have contributed to an accumulated deficit of $25.6 million as of March 25, 2017.\nBeginning in fiscal 2012, we invested substantially in the research and development of our new product line, ASG. We anticipate long-term revenue growth and improved gross margins from the ASG platform, but delays in completing it have contributed to our losses. We also experienced delays in the development of features, orders, and shipments for the new ASG. These delays have significantly contributed to a decrease in working capital from $1.8 million at March 26, 2016, to $620,000 at March 25, 2017. The Advanced Signal Generator product has now shipped to several customers, but potential delays in the refinement of features, longer than anticipated sales cycles, or the ability to continue shipments in volume quantities, could significantly contribute to additional future losses.\nThese matters raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nTo address these matters, our management has taken several actions to provide additional liquidity and reduce costs and expenses going forward. These actions are described in Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and in the \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d (Note 2, Going Concern and Management\u2019s Plan).\nCustomer orders and production of new product platform\nWe invested heavily in the development of our new ASG product platform but delays in completing it have contributed to our losses. Longer than anticipated sales cycles in future fiscal years, or delays in production and shipping volume quantities, could significantly contribute to additional losses.\nAbility to stay listed for trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market\nOn May 4, 2017, we received a notification letter from The NASDAQ Stock Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) advising the Company that it has initiated proceedings to delist the Company from NASDAQ for the Company\u2019s failure to comply with NASDAQ\u2019s bid price rule. As previously reported on November 1, 2016, NASDAQ notified the Company that the bid price of its listed security had closed at less than $1 per share over the previous 30 consecutive business days, and, thus, did not comply with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cRule\u201d).\nThe Company was provided 180 calendar days, or until May 1, 2017, to regain compliance with the Rule.\nAdditionally, the Company reported on February 8, 2017, that it received a notification letter from NASDAQ advising the Company of its failure to comply with the required minimum of either $2,500,000 in shareholders\u2019 equity, $35,000,000 market value of listed securities or $500,000 net income from continuing operations for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, pursuant to NASDAQ listing rule 5550(b). NASDAQ listing rules provided the Company with 45 calendar days in which to submit a plan to regain compliance. The Company submitted a plan on March 24, 2017, and NASDAQ notified the Company on April 20, 2017 of NASDAQ\u2019s acceptance of the plan and the granting of an extension through August 7, 2017; however, because the Company was not able to comply with the Rule, NASDAQ has determined that the Company is not eligible for a second 180 calendar day extension to comply with the Rule.\nThe Company may request an appeal of this determination or be scheduled for delisting; the Company appealed the determination before the NASDAQ deadline and attended a hearing on June 15, 2017. The Company is awaiting a determination from the hearing.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s plans to comply with the required bid price, minimum shareholders\u2019 equity, market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations will be successful. There can also be no assurance that the Company\u2019s appeal of the determination would be successful. If the Company\u2019s Common Stock ceases to be listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the Company expects that its Common Stock would be traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board on or about the same day.\nGiga-tronics\u2019 sales are substantially dependent on the defense industry\nWe have a significant number of defense-related orders. If the defense market demand decreases, actual shipments could be less than projected shipments with a resulting decline in sales. Our product backlog has a number of risks and uncertainties such as the cancellation or deferral of orders, dispute over performance and our ability to collect amounts due under these orders. If any of these events occur, actual shipments could be lower than projected shipments and revenues could decline which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity.\nGiga-tronics\u2019 markets involve rapidly changing technology and standards\nThe market for electronics equipment is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to develop and commercialize our existing products, and in part on our ability to develop, manufacture and successfully introduce new products and product lines with improved capabilities, and to continue to enhance existing products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete the development of current or future products, or that such products will achieve market acceptance. The inability to develop new products in a timely manner could have a material adverse impact on our operating performance and liquidity.\nGiga-tronics\u2019 common stock price is volatile\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results, reduction in revenues or lower earnings or increased losses and reduced levels of liquidity when compared to previous quarterly periods, and other factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or by our competitors, government regulations or developments in patent or other proprietary rights. In addition, NASDAQ and other stock markets have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years. Some of these fluctuations often have been unrelated to the reported operating performance of the specific companies whose stocks are traded. Broad market fluctuations, as well as general foreign and domestic economic conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur stock at any time has historically traded on low volume on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Sales of a significant volume of stock could result in a decline of our share price.\nPerformance problems in Giga-tronics\u2019 products or problems arising from the use of its products together with other vendors\u2019 products may harm its business and reputation\nProducts as complex as those we produce may contain unknown and undetected defects or performance problems. For example, it is possible that a product might not comply with stipulated specifications under all circumstances. In addition, our customers generally use our products together with their own products and products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a combined environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. A defect or performance problem could result in lost revenues, increased warranty costs, diversion of engineering and management time and effort, impaired customer relationships and injury to our reputation generally. To date, performance problems in our products or in other products used together with our products have not had a material adverse effect on our business. However, management cannot be certain that a material adverse impact will not occur in the future.\nGiga-tronics\u2019 competition has greater resources\nOur instrument, oscillator and synthesizer products compete with Agilent/Keysight, Anritsu, and Rohde & Schwarz. All these companies have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, and technological personnel and managerial resources than us. These resources also make these competitors better able to withstand difficult market conditions than us. There can be no assurance that any products developed by the competitors will not gain greater market acceptance than any developed by us.\nOur ASG product is complex and could have unknown defects or errors, which may increase our costs, harm our reputation with customers, give rise to costly litigation, or divert our resources from other purposes.\nOur new advanced signal generator product is extremely complex. Despite testing, our product has contained defects and errors and may in the future contain defects, errors, or performance problems when first introduced, when new versions or enhancements are released, or even after these products have been used by our customers for a period of time. These problems could result in expensive and time-consuming design modifications or warranty charges, delays in the introduction of new products or enhancements, significant increases in our service and maintenance costs, diversion of our personnel\u2019s attention from our product development efforts, exposure to liability for damages, damaged customer relationships, and harm to our reputation, any of which could materially harm our results of operations. In addition, increased development and warranty costs could be substantial and could reduce our operating margins.\nWe are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel, and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner.\nOur success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. The loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business.\nImpairment Loss on Capitalized Software Development Costs\nThe Company has capitalized certain software development costs. These costs are amortized over the expected life of the product and evaluated each reporting period for impairment. The Company examines the possibility of recovering the book value of assets based on the future cash flow to be generated from the asset. It may be necessary to recognize impairment of such asset if insufficient cash flow is generated.", "PERMNO": 39029, "SIC": 3670, "TIC": "GIGA"}
