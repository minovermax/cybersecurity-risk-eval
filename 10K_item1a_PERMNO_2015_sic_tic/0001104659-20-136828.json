RISK FACTORS.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, discussed in more detail in the following section. These risks include, among others, the following key risks:\n\u00b7 The COVID-19 global pandemic may continue to materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u00b7 Our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\u00b7 We have a history of net losses.\n\u00b7 We have not produced significant revenues. This makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and increases the risk that we will not be successful.\n\u00b7 Our opportunities in pharmaceuticals and biologics will require substantial additional funding. We may not be successful in our efforts to create a pipeline of product candidates or to develop commercially successful products. If we fail to successfully identify, finance and develop product candidates, our commercial opportunities in pharmaceuticals and biologics may be limited.\n\u00b7 Our LineaTM COVID-19 Assay Kit is being sold under a FDA EUA which could be revoked or terminated by the FDA at any time and will cease to be effective once the public health emergency justifying its use ends.\n\u00b7 Our COVID-19 Surveillance Testing may become obsolete for a variety of reasons, including an end to the current pandemic. The utility will also be diminished if positivity rates reach levels high enough to render surveillance testing ineffective or inefficient. Pharmaceutical and biologic products are highly complex, and if we or our collaborators and customers are unable to provide quality and timely offerings to our respective customers, our business could suffer.\n\u00b7 Our LineaTM COVID-19 Assay Kits could become obsolete or their utility could be significantly diminished.\n\u00b7 Pharmaceutical and biologic-related revenue will be dependent on our collaborators\u2019 and customers\u2019 demand for our manufacturing services.\n\u00b7 The markets for our drug and biologic candidates and linear DNA are very competitive, and we may be unable to continue to compete effectively in these industries in the future.\n\u00b7 The markets for our supply chain security and product authentication solutions are very competitive, and we may be unable to continue to compete effectively in these industries in the future.\n\u00b7 Intellectual property litigation could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u00b7 Our joint pursuit of a potential vaccine for COVID-19 is at an early stage and may be unable to produce a vaccine that successfully treats the virus in a timely manner, if at all, and compete successfully with vaccines developed by larger companies.\n\u00b7 Pharmaceutical and biologic-related revenue is generally dependent on regulatory approval, oversight and compliance.\n\u00b7 The regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming, and inherently unpredictable. If we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will be unable to generate product revenue and our business will be substantially harmed.\n\u00b7 If the FDA were to begin to enforce regulation of Laboratory Developed Tests (\u201cLDTs\u201d), we could incur substantial costs and delays associated with trying to obtain pre-market clearance or approval and costs associated with complying with post-market requirements.\n\u00b7 If we are unable to obtain laboratory licensure or we fail to comply with laboratory licensing requirements, we could lose the ability to offer our clinical testing services or experience disruptions to our business.\n\u00b7 If we fail to comply with healthcare laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected.\n\u00b7 We need to expand our sales, marketing and support organizations to increase market acceptance of our products and services.\n\u00b7 If we are unable to continue to retain the services of Dr. Hayward, we may not be able to continue our operations.\n\u00b7 We may have conflicts of interest with our affiliates and related parties, and in the past we have engaged in transactions and entered into agreements with affiliates that were not negotiated at arms\u2019 length.\n\u00b7 There are a large number of shares of common stock underlying our outstanding options and warrants and the sale of these shares may depress the market price of our common stock and cause immediate and substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nIn addition to the above key factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results and financial condition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report and our other reports and documents filed with the SEC, risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we may currently deem immaterial also may impair our business, financial condition, operating results and/or stock price. If any of the following risks or such other risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, operating results and/or stock price could be harmed. In the following factors, \u201cvolatility in our share price\u201d, \u201cadverse impact on the price (or value) of our shares\u201d, \u201cdecline in the price of our common stock\u201d and similar terms also refer to our warrants and shares to be received upon exercise of our warrants.\nRisks Relating to Our Business:\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic may continue to materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business has been and could continue to be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of a widespread health epidemic. The present coronavirus (or COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted our operations and has affected our business, as government authorities impose mandatory closures, work-from-home orders and social distancing protocols or impose other restrictions that could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations. Portions of our business are considered \u201cessential\u201d such as our government and pharmaceutical contracts, as well as our vaccine and diagnostic candidate development and our COVID-19 Surveillance Testing. However, we have experienced, and may continue to experience in the future, facility closures related to our \u201cnonessential\u201d businesses, and pursuant to the government order, the Company has reduced the scope of its operations and where possible, certain workers are telecommuting from their homes. As a result of COVID-19 we have experienced a decline in revenues from non-biological tagging and related services. As the COVID-19 outbreak and responses to it continue to evolve, we may experience further adverse impacts on our operations, including our ability to secure supplies, and our ability to access capital on favorable terms, or at all, may be impaired. There may also be long-term effects on our customers in and the economies of affected countries. Although the duration and ultimate impact of these factors is unknown at this time, the decline in economic conditions due to COVID-19, or another disease-causing similar impacts, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and such impact may be material.\nThere is substantial doubt relating to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have recurring net losses, which have resulted in an accumulated deficit of $269,835,650 as of September 30, 2020. We have incurred a net loss of $13,028,904 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. At September 30, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $7,786,743. We have concluded that these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the financial statements. In addition, the report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended September 30, 2020 includes an explanatory paragraph stating that our significant losses and needs to raise additional funds to meet our obligations and sustain operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We will continue to seek to raise additional working capital through public equity, private equity or debt financings. If we fail to raise additional working capital, or do so on commercially unfavorable terms, it would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. Future reports from our independent registered public accounting firm may also contain statements expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nWe may not be entitled to forgiveness of our recently received Paycheck Protection Program Loan, and our application for the Paycheck Protection Program Loan could in the future be determined to have been impermissible.\nIn May 2020, we received loan proceeds of approximately $847 thousand (the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the \u201cSBA\u201d). The PPP Loan, if not forgiven, bears interest at a rate of 1.00% per annum, and is subject to the standard terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the SBA under the CARES Act.\nUnder the terms of the CARES Act, PPP Loan recipients must meet certain eligibility criteria. Due to the size of the PPP Loan, it is subject to review by regulators. We could be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of loans granted under the PPP. Such forgiveness will be determined based on the use of loan proceeds for payment of payroll costs and any payments of mortgage interest, rent, and utilities. We have considered the requirements of the PPP Loan and we believe we are within the eligibility threshold and have used the loan proceeds in accordance with PPP Loan forgiveness requirements. However, no assurance can be provided that we will obtain forgiveness for any portion of the PPP Loan.\nFurther, if despite our actions and certification that we satisfied all eligibility requirements for the PPP Loan, it is later determined that we violated applicable laws or were otherwise ineligible to receive the PPP Loan, we may be required to repay the PPP Loan in its entirety in a lump sum or be subject to additional penalties, which could result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation. If these events were to transpire, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have not produced significant revenues. This makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and increases the risk that we will not be successful.\nOur operations since inception have produced limited revenues and may not produce significant revenues in the near term, or at all, which may harm our ability to obtain additional financing and may require us to reduce or discontinue our operations. You must consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we will encounter as a company operating in a rapidly evolving industry. We may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties, which could significantly harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur new emphasis on biotherapeutic contract research and manufacturing and COVID-19 diagnostic and surveillance testing may reduce our ability to maintain and expand our existing Non-Biologic Tagging businesses\nOur new emphasis on biotherapeutic contract research and manufacturing and COVID-19 diagnostic and surveillance testing may divert funding and our limited managerial and other resources from our existing non-biologic tagging businesses. This may have the effect of reducing opportunities to grow or maintain revenues in our existing businesses while at the same time we may fail in our biotherapeutic contracts research and manufacturing and COVID-19 diagnostic and surveillance testing efforts.\nOur opportunities in pharmaceuticals and biologics will require substantial additional funding. We may not be successful in our efforts to create a pipeline of product candidates or to develop commercially successful products. If we fail to successfully identify, finance and develop product candidates, our commercial opportunities in pharmaceuticals and biologics may be limited.\nWe have no pharmaceutical or biologic products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from pharmaceutical or biologic product sales. Identifying, developing, obtaining regulatory approval and commercializing pharmaceutical and biologic product candidates will require substantial additional funding beyond our current available resources and is prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug or biologic development. Developing product candidates is expensive, and we expect to spend substantial amounts as we fund our early-stage research projects, engage in preclinical development of early-stage programs and, in particular, advance program candidates through preclinical development and clinical trials.\nInvestment in pharmaceutical and biologic product development involves significant risk that any product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval, and become commercially viable. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to successfully advance any product candidates through the development process or, if approved, successfully commercialize any product candidates.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates, we cannot assure you that any such product candidate will be successfully commercialized, widely accepted in the marketplace or be more effective than other commercially available alternatives.\nEven if we are able to generate revenue from the sale of any approved pharmaceutical and biologic products, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our Company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our pipeline of product candidates or continue our operations, and cause a decline in the value of our common stock, all or any of which may adversely affect our viability.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction in business with our significant customers.\nOur revenue earned from the sale of products and services for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 included an aggregate of 46% of our total revenues from four customers. These four customers accounted for approximately 22% of our total accounts receivable at September 30, 2020. At September 30, 2020, four customers accounted for an aggregate of 74% of our total accounts receivable. Our revenue earned from the sale of products and services for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 included an aggregate of 68% of our total revenues from three customers. These three customers accounted for approximately 82% of our total accounts receivable at September 30, 2019. At September 30, 2019, one customer accounted for an aggregate of 77% of our total accounts receivable. Generally, our customers do not have an obligation to make purchases from us and may stop ordering our products and services or may terminate existing orders or contracts at any time with little or no financial penalty. The loss of any of our significant customers, any substantial decline in sales to these customers, or any significant change in the timing or volume of purchases by our customers could result in lower revenues and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFluctuations in quarterly results may cause a decline in the price of our common stock.\nOur revenues and profitability are difficult to predict due to the nature of the markets in which we compete, as well as our recent entry into new markets and products, such as our LineaTM COVID-19 Assay Kit and our COVID-19 Surveillance Testing, fluctuating user demand, the uncertainty of current and future global economic conditions, and for many other reasons, including that our operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during a quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Customers generally order on an as-needed basis and we typically do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers. The quarterly fluctuations in operating results described above may cause a decline in the price of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Product Candidates, Manufacturing, Development, and Industries:\nOur LineaTM COVID-19 Assay Kit is being sold under an FDA EUA.\nOur LineaTM COVID-19 Assay Kit has not been cleared or approved by FDA, but has been authorized for sale under an EUA. The FDA has the authority to grant an EUA to allow unapproved medical products to be used in an emergency when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. The EUA authorizes our test to be used by laboratories certified to perform high complexity testing under CLIA. The EUA includes conditions of authorization with which we must comply, including, but not limited to, compliance with labeling, distribution of materials designed to ensure proper use, reporting obligations, and restrictions on advertising and promotion. Distributors of and laboratories using our LineaTM COVID-19 Assay Kit must also comply with the relevant provisions of our EUA. The EUA is only effective for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency. The FDA may revoke or terminate the EUA sooner if, for example, we fail to comply with the terms of the EUA or our test is determined to be less accurate than it was initially believed to be. We cannot predict how long the EUA will remain in place. If the EUA is revoked or terminated, it could significantly harm our business, results of operations, and profits.\nOur safeCircleTM surveillance testing service could become obsolete or its utility could be significantly diminished.\nSurveillance testing is not regulated by the FDA and CMS has stated that CLIA certification is not required to conduct surveillance testing. ADCL is offering its safeCircleTM surveillance testing in compliance with current CDC, FDA, CMS and New York State Department of Health recommendations. The regulatory framework or recommendations regarding COVID-19 Surveillance Testing could change at any time. Further, our COVID-19 Surveillance Testing may become obsolete for a variety of reasons, including an end to the current pandemic or the development and widespread distribution of a vaccine, including the vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech for which the FDA has recently granted emergency use authorization. In addition, the utility of these services will also diminish if positivity rates reach levels high enough to render surveillance testing ineffective or inefficient.\nOur LineaTM COVID-19 Assay Kits could become obsolete or their utility could be significantly diminished.\nOur LineaTM COVID-19 Assay Kits may become obsolete for a variety of reasons, including an end to the current pandemic or the development and widespread distribution of a vaccine, including the vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech for which the FDA has recently granted emergency use authorization.\nOur joint pursuit of a potential vaccine for COVID-19 is at an early stage and may be unable to produce a vaccine that successfully treats the virus in a timely manner, if at all , and compete successfully with vaccines developed by larger companies.\nIn response to the global outbreak of coronavirus, we are jointly pursuing the development of linear DNA vaccine candidates in collaboration with Takis/Evvivax. Our joint development of vaccine candidates is in early stages, and we may be unable to produce a successful vaccine candidate in a timely manner, if at all. Additionally, development of an effective vaccine candidate depends on the success of our and our partner\u2019s manufacturing capabilities, and we may face challenges in clinical trials, licensing, distribution channels, intellectual property disputes or challenges, and the need to establish teams of people with the relevant skills worldwide. We may also face challenges with sourcing a sufficient amount of raw materials to support the demand for a vaccine. We may be unable to effectively create a supply chain for any vaccine candidate that will adequately support demand.\nWe would require additional funding in order to enable the development of vaccine candidates. Our commitment of financial resources and personnel to the joint development of these vaccine candidates may cause delays in or otherwise negatively impact our other development programs and could prove futile, as future demand for any successful vaccine is unknown.\nIn addition, another party may be successful in producing a more efficacious vaccine or other treatment for COVID-19 which may reduce or eliminate demand for any successful vaccine that we may jointly develop. In particular, given the widespread media attention on the current COVID-19 pandemic, there are efforts by public and private entities to develop a COVID-19 vaccine as fast as possible. On December 11, 2020, the FDA issued the first emergency use authorization to Pfizer-BioNTech for a vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older. The emergency use authorization allows the COVID-19 vaccine to be distributed in the U.S. In addition to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, other entities, including AstraZeneca PLC, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Inc., and Sanofi, may develop COVID-19 vaccines that are more effective than any we may jointly develop, may develop a COVID-19 vaccine that becomes the standard of care, may develop a COVID-19 vaccine at a lower cost or earlier than we are able to jointly develop any COVID-19 vaccine, or may be more successful at commercializing a COVID-19 vaccine. These other organizations are much larger than we are and have access to larger pools of capital and broader manufacturing infrastructure. The success or failure of other entities, or perceived success or failure, may adversely impact our ability to obtain any future funding for our joint COVID-19 vaccine development efforts or for us to ultimately commercialize any vaccine candidate, if approved.\nPharmaceutical and biologic products are highly complex, and if we or our collaborators and customers are unable to provide quality and timely offerings to our respective customers, our business could suffer.\nThe process of manufacturing pharmaceutical and biologics and their components is complex, highly-regulated and subject to multiple risks.\nManufacturing biologics is highly susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, inconsistency in yields, variability in product characteristics and difficulties in scaling the production process. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions.\nOur ability to generate revenue in the pharmaceutical and biologic market depends on our ability to manufacture products that meet exacting quality and safety standards. If we are unable to manufacture these products to the required levels, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and may subject us to regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture or distribution, restrictions on our operations, or civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions and criminal actions. In addition, we could be subject to costly litigation, including claims from our collaborators and customers for reimbursement for the cost of our products or other related losses, the cost of which could be significant.\nOur business also depends on the ability of our collaborators and customers to manufacture the pharmaceutical or biologic products that incorporate our products. If the FDA determines that our collaborators and customers are not in compliance with FDA laws and regulations, including those governing cGMP regulations, the FDA may deny NDA or BLA approval until the deficiencies are corrected. Even if our collaborators or customers obtain regulatory approval for any of their product candidates, there is no assurance that they will be able to manufacture the approved product to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product or to meet potential future demand. If our collaborators or customers are unable to produce sufficient quantities for clinical trials or for commercialization, commercialization efforts would be impaired, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nPharmaceutical and biologic-related revenue will be dependent on our collaborators\u2019 and customers\u2019 demand for our manufacturing services.\nThe amount of customer spending on pharmaceutical and biologic development and manufacturing will have an impact on our sales and profitability in the pharmaceutical and biologic market. Our collaborators and customers determine the amounts that they will spend based upon, among other things, available resources, access to capital, and their need to develop new products, which, in turn, are dependent upon a number of factors, including their competitors\u2019 research, development and product initiatives and the anticipated market uptake, and clinical and reimbursement scenarios for specific products and therapeutic areas. Consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biologic industry may impact such spending as customers integrate acquired operations, including R&D departments and manufacturing operations. Any reduction in spending on pharmaceutical and biotechnology development and related services as a result of these and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe markets for our drug and biologic candidates and linear DNA are very competitive, and we may be unable to continue to compete effectively in these industries in the future.\nThe principal markets for our drug and biologic candidates and linear DNA are intensely competitive. We compete with many existing suppliers and new competitors continue to enter the market. Many of our competitors, both in the United States and elsewhere, are major pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies, or have strategic alliances with such companies, and many of them have substantially greater capital resources, marketing experience, research and development staff, and facilities than we do. Any of these companies could succeed in developing products that are more effective than the product candidates that we have or may develop and may be more successful than us in producing and marketing their existing products. Some of our competitors that operate in the nucleic-acid based therapeutic, biologics and DNA manufacturing markets include: Precigen, Inc., Aldevron, LLC, Cobra Biologics, Limited, Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Ziopharm Oncology, Inc., MaxCyte, Inc., Touchlight Genetics Ltd., Novartis AG, Kite Pharma, Inc. and Juno Therapeutics, Inc.\nWe expect this competition to continue and intensify in the future. Our competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drug and biologic candidates or linear DNA that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any drug and biologic candidates and linear DNA that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Additionally, drug and biologic candidates and linear DNA developed by our competitors may render our potential drug and biologic candidates and linear DNA uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing any drug and biologic candidates and linear DNA we may develop against competitors.\nIf any of these risks occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed.\nThe markets for our supply chain security and product authentication solutions are very competitive, and we may be unable to continue to compete effectively in these industries in the future.\nThe principal markets for our offerings are intensely competitive. We compete with many existing suppliers and new competitors continue to enter the market. Many of our competitors, both in the United States and elsewhere, are major pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies, or have strategic alliances with such companies, and many of them have substantially greater capital resources, marketing experience, research and development staff, and facilities than we do. Any of these companies could succeed in developing products that are more effective than the products that we have or may develop and may be more successful than us in producing and marketing their existing products. Some of our competitors that operate in the supply chain security and product authentication markets include: AlpVision Sa, Authentix, Inc., Brandwatch Technologies, Inc., Chromologic LLC, Collectors Universe, Inc., DataDot Technology Limited, De La Rue Plc., Digimarc Corporation, DNA Technologies, Inc., Haelixa Ltd., ICA Bremen GmbH, IEH Corporation, Informium AG, opSec Security Group plc., MicroTag Temed Ltd., Nanotech Security Corp., Nokomis, Inc., Oritain Global Limited, SafeTraces, Inc., Selectamark Security Systems plc, SmartWater Technology, Inc., Sun Chemical Corporation, TraceTag International Ltd., TruTag Technologies, Inc., Tailorlux gmbH and YottaMark Inc.\nWe expect this competition to continue and intensify in the future.\nOur research and development efforts for new products may be unsuccessful.\nWe incur research and development expenses to develop new products and technologies in an effort to maintain our competitive position in a market characterized by rapid rates of technological advancement. Under our COVID-19 Diagnostic and Surveillance Testing businesses, our research and development efforts are focused on the development of high-throughput high-sensitivity molecular assays for COVID-19. Our research and development efforts are subject to unanticipated delays, expenses and technical problems. There can be no assurance that any of these products or technologies will be successfully developed or that, if developed, will be commercially successful. In the event that we are unable to develop commercialized products from our research and development efforts or we are unable or unwilling to allocate amounts beyond our currently anticipated research and development investment, we could lose our entire investment in these new products and technologies. Any failure to translate research and development expenditures into successful new product introduction could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, research, development, and commercialization of pharmaceutical and biologic products is inherently risky. We cannot give any assurance that any of our pharmaceutical and biologic product candidates will receive regulatory approval, which is necessary before they can be commercialized.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property:\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brand.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and all of our other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. There are events that are outside of our control that pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products and services. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed. The efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained from one of our issued patents will be insufficient or deemed invalid or unenforceable. We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy could be compromised by third parties, or intentionally or accidentally by our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.\nIntellectual property litigation could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights is extensive in the drug and biotechnology industry. In the event of an intellectual property dispute, we may be forced to litigate. This litigation could involve proceedings instituted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or the International Trade Commission, as well as proceedings brought directly by affected third parties. Intellectual property litigation can be extremely expensive, and these expenses, as well as the consequences should we not prevail, could seriously harm our business.\nIf a third party claims an intellectual property right to technology we use, we might need to discontinue an important product or product line, alter our products and processes, pay license fees or cease our affected business activities. Although we might under these circumstances attempt to obtain a license to this intellectual property, we may not be able to do so on favorable terms, or at all. Furthermore, a third party may claim that we are using inventions covered by the third party\u2019s patent rights and may go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, including making or selling our products. These lawsuits are costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. A court may decide that we are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and would order us to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, a court may order us to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party\u2019s patents. The drug and biotechnology industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods of use either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent and/or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity, in particular, is difficult since it requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.\nBecause some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing, and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our or our licensor\u2019s issued patents or pending applications or that we or our licensors were the first to invent the technology. During the ordinary course of our business, we do not conduct \u201cprior art\u201d searches before filing a patent application. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our or our licensors\u2019 patent applications and could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a United States patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our United States patent position with respect to such inventions.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nA cybersecurity incident and other technology disruptions could negatively affect our business and our relationships with customers.\nWe use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations. The widespread use of technology, including mobile devices, cloud computing, and the internet, give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including information relating to customers and suppliers, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about us and our business partners. If we fail to effectively assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with the use of technology in our business operations, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Pharmaceutical and Biotherapeutic Product Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters:\nThe regulatory pathway of a potential vaccine for COVID-19 is continually evolving, and may result in unexpected or unforeseen challenges.\nThe speed at which all parties are moving to create, test and approve a vaccine for COVID-19 is highly unusual, and evolving or changing plans or priorities at the FDA, including based on new knowledge of COVID-19 and how the disease affects the human body, may significantly affect the regulatory pathway for any of our potential vaccine candidates. For example, any results from clinical testing may raise new questions and require us to redesign proposed clinical trials, including revising proposed endpoints or adding new clinical trial sites or cohorts of subjects. In addition, the FDA\u2019s analysis of any clinical data may differ from our interpretation and the FDA may require that we conduct additional analyses.\nThe FDA has the authority to grant an EUA to allow unapproved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. If we are granted an EUA for any vaccine candidate, we would be able to commercialize it prior to FDA approval. The EUA is only effective for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency. The FDA may revoke or terminate the EUA sooner if, for example, we fail to comply with the terms of the EUA or our vaccine is determined to be less effective or safe than it was initially believed to be. We cannot predict how long, if ever, an EUA would remain in place.\nShifting enforcement priorities of federal and state laws relating to cannabis may create uncertainties for our business.\nSome of our products may be incorporated into cannabis products which are subject to regulation by federal and state regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in foreign countries. Cannabis is a Schedule I substance, as defined under federal law, and its possession and use is generally not permitted under federal law, although a number of individual states have enacted state laws to authorize possession, sale and use of cannabis for medical purposes, and in some states for recreational purposes. Revenue from the cannabis market is highly dependent on our customers\u2019 continuing compliance with federal and state regulations which may change over time. Our business may be materially harmed by their failure to comply with applicable regulations and may subject us to an increased risk of litigation.\nPharmaceutical and biologic-related revenue is generally dependent on regulatory approval, oversight and compliance.\nAll of our pharmaceutical and biologic product candidates, except for our LineaTM COVID-19 Assay Kit and our COVID-19 Surveillance Testing, will require significant preclinical and clinical development before we can seek regulatory approval for them and launch a product commercially. The sale and use of our products and services in the pharmaceutical and biologic markets will generally be subject to regulatory approval and oversight, potentially including approval and/or oversight in various foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our pharmaceutical and biologic products and services may be incorporated into products that cannot be marketed in the United States or in many other jurisdictions without approval by the FDA or comparable agencies of other countries or regions. Obtaining such regulatory approvals is costly, time-consuming, uncertain, and subject to unanticipated delays. When, if ever, such approvals will be obtained is unknown. Our revenue in the pharmaceutical and biologic markets is highly dependent upon obtaining such approval.\nFederal agencies, including the FDA and Federal Trade Commission, as well as state, local, and foreign authorities, also exercise ongoing review and control of the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, sale, distribution, and monitoring of pharmaceutical and biologic products. If our pharmaceutical or biologic product candidates or pharmaceutical or biologic products incorporating our products are ever approved, failure to comply with any of these regulations or other requirements could also have an adverse effect on our revenue in the pharmaceutical and biologic markets.\nPharmaceutical and biologic-related revenue will be highly dependent on our collaborators\u2019 and customers\u2019 success in obtaining regulatory approval and commercializing their products.\nSome of our products will be incorporated into products in the pharmaceutical and biologic market that are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. In the United States, to obtain approval from the FDA to market any future pharmaceutical or biologic product that incorporates our technology, our collaborators or customers will be required to submit a NDA or BLA. Ordinarily, the FDA requires a company to support an NDA or BLA with substantial evidence of the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy in treating the targeted indication based on data derived from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, including Phase III safety and efficacy trials conducted in patients with the disease or condition being targeted. The process of obtaining such regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate involved. Changes in the regulatory approval process during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in the regulatory review process may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. There is no guarantee that our collaborators and customers will ever be successful in obtaining regulatory approval for any product that incorporates our products or technology. Even if regulatory approval is received, the manufacturing processes, post approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for any such product will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. Our business may be materially harmed by our collaborators\u2019 and customers\u2019 failure to comply with applicable regulations.\nIn addition, we will be dependent on, and have no control over, consumer demand for the products into which our products are incorporated. Consumer demand for our collaborators\u2019 and customers\u2019 products could be adversely affected by, among other things, delays in health regulatory approval, the loss of patent and other intellectual property rights protection, the emergence of competing products, including generic drugs or biosimilars, the degree to which private and government drug plans subsidize payment for a particular product and changes in the marketing strategies for such products. The healthcare industry has changed significantly over time, and we expect the industry to continue to evolve. Some of these changes may have a material adverse effect on our collaborators and customers and thus may have a material adverse effect on our business. If the products into which our products are incorporated do not gain market acceptance, our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming, and inherently unpredictable. If we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will be unable to generate product revenue and our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities is unpredictable, typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials, and depends upon numerous factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions, which may cause delays in the approval or the decision not to approve an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. We have not submitted for, or obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate, and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. Applications for our product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for a variety of reasons. This lengthy approval process, as well as the unpredictability of the results of clinical trials, may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could halt their clinical development, prevent their regulatory approval, limit their commercial potential, or result in significant negative consequences.\nAdverse events or other undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by regulatory authorities. Side effects related to a drug or biologic could affect patient recruitment, the ability of enrolled patients to complete the study, and/or result in potential product liability claims.\nAdditionally, if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects or adverse events caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result. Regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product or impose restrictions on distribution. They may require additional warnings or contraindications on the product label that could diminish the usage or otherwise limit the commercial success of the product. We may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or post-approval studies. We may be forced to suspend marketing of the product or required to create a REMS. In addition, our reputation may suffer. Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, our products will remain subject to extensive regulatory scrutiny.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved, they will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, conduct of post-marketing studies, and submission of safety, efficacy, and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States and requirements of comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Ongoing regulatory requirements include ensuring that quality control and manufacturing and production procedures conform to cGMP regulations, and we will be subject to continual review and inspections to assess compliance with cGMP regulations and adherence to commitments made in any regulatory filings. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates will be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed and promoted or to the conditions of approval (including the requirement to implement a REMS), or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing. We will be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Any new legislation addressing drug or biologic safety issues could result in delays in product development or commercialization, or increased costs to assure compliance. The FDA and other agencies, including the Department of Justice, closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that they are manufactured, marketed and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. We will have to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs and biologics are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved label. As such, we may not promote our products for indications or uses for which they do not have approval. The holder of an approved NDA must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process. We could also be asked to conduct post-marketing clinical trials to verify the safety and efficacy of our products in general or in specific patient subsets. If original marketing approval was obtained via the accelerated approval pathway, we could be required to conduct a successful post-marketing clinical trial to confirm clinical benefit for our products. An unsuccessful post-marketing study or failure to complete such a study could result in the withdrawal of marketing approval.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of a product, such regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or us, including, but not limited to, requiring withdrawal or recall of the product from the market, imposing civil or criminal penalties, and imposing restrictions on our operations. Any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response, and could generate negative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from our products. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, the value of our Company and our operating results will be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the FDA\u2019s regulations, policies or guidance may change and new or additional statutes or government regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions may be enacted that could further restrict or regulate post-approval activities. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from pending or future legislation or administrative action. If we are not able to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our products and/or product candidates, which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability.\nIf the FDA were to begin to enforce regulation of LDTs, we could incur substantial costs and delays associated with trying to obtain pre-market clearance or approval and costs associated with complying with post-market requirements.\nAs a LDT, our iCTC capture assay is currently subject to enforcement discretion by the FDA. In October 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents: \u201cFramework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests,\u201d which provides an overview of how the FDA would regulate LDTs through a risk-based approach, and \u201cFDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests\u201d, which provides guidance on how the FDA intends to collect information on existing LDTs, including adverse event reports. Pursuant to the Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance, LDT manufacturers will be subject to medical device registration, listing, and adverse event reporting requirements. LDT manufacturers will be required to either submit a pre-market application and receive the FDA\u2019s approval before an LDT may be marketed or submit a pre-market notification in advance of marketing. The Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance states that within six months after the guidance documents are finalized, all laboratories will be required to give notice to the FDA and provide basic information concerning the nature of the LDTs offered.\nOn November 18, 2016, however, the FDA announced that it would not release final versions of these guidance documents and would instead continue to work with stakeholders, the new administration and Congress to determine the right approach. On January 13, 2017, the FDA released a discussion paper on LDTs outlining a possible risk-based approach for FDA and CMS oversight of LDTs. According to the 2017 discussion paper, previously marketed LDTs would not be expected to comply with most or all FDA oversight requirements (grandfathering), except for adverse event and malfunction reporting. In addition, certain new and significantly modified LDTs would not be expected to comply with pre-market review unless the agency determines certain tests could lead to patient harm. Since LDTs currently on the market would be grandfathered in, pre-market review of new and significantly modified LDTs could be phased-in over a four-year period, as opposed to the nine years proposed in the Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance. In addition, tests introduced after the effective date, but before their phase-in date, could continue to be offered during pre-market review.\nThe discussion paper notes that the FDA will focus on analytical and clinical validity as the basis for marketing authorization. The FDA anticipates laboratories that already conduct proper validation should not be expected to experience new costs for validating their tests to support marketing authorization and laboratories that conduct appropriate evaluations would not have to collect additional data to demonstrate analytical validity for FDA clearance or approval. This goal would be achieved through a precertification process. The evidence of the analytical and clinical validity of all LDTs will be made publically available. LDTs are encouraged to submit prospective change protocols in their pre-market submission that outline specific types of anticipated changes, the procedures that will be followed to implement them, and the criteria that will be met prior to implementation.\nIn March 2017, a draft bill \u201cThe Diagnostics Accuracy and Innovation Act\u201d (\u201cDAIA\u201d) was introduced in Congress. The bill would establish a new regulatory framework for the oversight of in vitro clinical tests (\u201cIVCTs\u201d) which include LDTs. Following review and comment from FDA on the provisions of DAIA, a revised version of the bill, now called \u201cThe Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge IVCT Development Act\u201d (VALID) was introduced in Congress in December 2018. Under the bill, a risk-based approach will be used to regulate IVCTs. Each test will be classified as high-risk or low-risk. Pre-market review will be required for high-risk tests. To market a high-risk IVCT, reasonable assurance of analytical and clinical validity for the intended use must be established. Under VALID, a precertification process would be established which will allow a laboratory to establish that the facilities, methods, and controls used in the development of its IVCTs meet quality system requirements. If pre-certified, low-risk IVCTs it develops will not be subject to pre-market review. The new regulatory framework will include quality control and post-market reporting requirements. The FDA will have the authority to withdraw from the market IVCTs that present an unreasonable and substantial risk of illness or injury when used as intended. We cannot predict whether this bill will become law. If the FDA were to require us to seek clearance or approval for our existing product or any of our future products for clinical use, we may not be able to obtain such approvals on a timely basis or at all. Our business could be negatively impacted as a result of commercial delay that may be caused by any new requirements. The cost of conducting clinical trials and otherwise developing data and information to support pre-market approval may be significant. If we are required to submit applications for our currently-marketed iCTC test, we may be required to conduct additional studies, which may be time-consuming and costly and could result in our currently-marketed test being withdrawn from the market. Continued compliance with the FDA\u2019s regulations would increase the cost of conducting our business, and subject us to heightened regulation by the FDA and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, such as fines, product suspensions, warning letters, recalls, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions. Any other regulatory or legislative proposals that would increase general FDA oversight of clinical laboratories and LDTs could negatively impact our business if additional requirements are imposed. We are monitoring developments and anticipate that our products will be able to comply with requirements that are ultimately imposed by the FDA.\nIf we fail to comply with laboratory licensing requirements, we could lose the ability to offer our clinical testing services or experience disruptions to our business.\nCLIA is a federal law regulating clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease. CLIA is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. Clinical laboratories must be certified under CLIA in order to perform testing on human specimens, unless they fall within an exception to CLIA certification, such as research laboratories that test human specimens but do not report patient-specific results for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or impairment of, or the assessment of the health of individual patients. CLIA certification is also required to be eligible to bill Federal and State healthcare programs, as well as many private third-party payers, for diagnostic testing and services. Currently, we are supplying our iCTC capture assay and associated testing services under the research exception to CLIA. We also sell COVID-19 Surveillance Testing services which, under FDA and CDC guidance, do not require an EUA or CLIA certification. If we expand our laboratory testing services so that the research exception no longer applies to our iCTC capture assay or regulations and guidances change so that our COVID-19 Surveillance Testing cannot be conducted without CLIA certification, we will no longer be able to offer these services. Further, if we fail to comply with the CLIA research exception with respect to our iCTC capture assay or we fail to comply with the government\u2019s guidance regarding COVID-19 surveillance testing, we could be found to have violated FDA or CLIA regulations or guidances and could have to stop offering these services and potentially be assessed substantial penalties. We have applied for CLIA certification but do not know when, or if, we will receive it. A delay in obtaining certification or a failure to do so could significantly harm our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nHealthcare legislative measures aimed at reducing healthcare costs may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThird party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. In particular, in the United States in 2010, the ACA was enacted. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. The repeal of or changes in some or all of the ACA and complying with any new legislation or reversing changes implemented under the ACA could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. Until the ACA is fully implemented or there is more certainty concerning the future of the ACA, it will be difficult to predict its full impact and influence on our business.\nThere have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare and/or impose price controls may adversely affect the demand for our product candidates, if we obtain regulatory approval, including: our ability to receive or set a price that we believe is fair for our products; our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability; the level of taxes that we are required to pay; and the availability of capital. We expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, lower reimbursement, and new payment methodologies. This could lower the price that we receive for any approved product. Any denial in coverage or reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar denial or reduction in payments from private payors, which may prevent us from being able to generate sufficient revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates, if approved.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud, misconduct or other illegal activity by our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners and vendors. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and negligent conduct that fails to: comply with the laws of the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities; provide true, complete and accurate information to the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities; comply with manufacturing standards we have established; comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws in the United States and similar foreign fraudulent misconduct laws; or report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us.\nIf we obtain FDA approval of any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our potential exposure under such laws will increase significantly, and our costs associated with compliance with such laws are also likely to increase. In particular, research, sales, marketing, education and other business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, educating, marketing and promotion, sales and commission, certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. Even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third party payors, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. Restrictions under applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations which may affect our ability to operate and expose us to areas of risk include: federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claims Act; HIPAA, as amended by HITECH; the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, and its implementing regulations; federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and analogous state and foreign laws and regulations.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could, despite our efforts to comply, be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. In addition, the approval and commercialization of any of our product candidates outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.\nRisks Related to Personnel:\nOur failure to manage our growth in operations and acquisitions of new product lines and new businesses could harm our business.\nThe recent growth in our operations could place a significant strain on our current management resources, specifically as it relates to our LineaTM COVID-19 Assay Kit and our COVID-19 pooled surveillance testing offering branded under the safeCircleTM trademark. We seek to continue to commercialize the safeCircleTM surveillance testing TaaS offering with institutional clients such as schools, colleges and businesses. In addition, we have applied to the New York State Department of Health for all necessary licensing to operate a New York State clinical diagnostics laboratory. These applications are currently pending. The New York State Department of Health performed its initial inspection of our clinical laboratory and identified deficiencies in the clinical standard of practice. These deficiencies need to be rectified before we can submit a request for re-inspection. We are working to rectify these deficiencies now. We seek to further commercialize our EUA authorized Linea COVID-19 Assay Kit and our iCTC Technology. We are also performing testing services in support of our safeCircleTM surveillance testing services in accordance with current CDC, FDA, CMS and New York State Department of Health recommendations.\nTo manage such growth, we may need to improve our:\n\u00b7 operations and financial systems;\n\u00b7 procedures and controls; and\n\u00b7 training and management of our employees.\nIf we are unable to continue to retain the services of Dr. Hayward, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of Dr. James A. Hayward, our CEO. On July 28, 2016, we entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Hayward. The initial term was from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017, with automatic one-year renewal periods. As of June 30, 2020, the employment contract automatically renewed for an additional year. Loss of the services of Dr. Hayward could significantly harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We do not maintain key-person insurance on the life of Dr. Hayward.\nWe may have conflicts of interest with our affiliates and related parties, and in the past we have engaged in transactions and entered into agreements with affiliates that were not negotiated at arms\u2019 length.\nWe have engaged, and may in the future engage, in transactions with affiliates and other related parties. These transactions may not have been, and may not be, on terms as favorable to us as they could have been if obtained from non-affiliated persons. While an effort has been made, and will continue to be made, to enter into transactions with affiliated persons and other related parties at rates and on terms as favorable as would be charged by others, there will always be an inherent conflict of interest between our interests and those of our affiliates and related parties. In August 2018 and November 2018, we issued an aggregate of $2.2 million in principal amount of secured convertible notes, a majority of which were owned by Dr. James A. Hayward, our CEO. Dr. Hayward and other directors, officers, and affiliates of the Company converted substantial portions of such August 2018 Notes and November 2018 Notes (in each case, as defined in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below) into common stock of the Company in September 2019. During October 2020 we entered into Warrant Exercise Agreements with Dillon Hill Capital, LLC and its affiliate, Dillon Hill Investment Company LLC, a greater than 5% shareholder in the Company, whereby 318,000 warrants were exercised. The gross proceeds to the Company from this partial exercise of the 2019 Warrants (as defined below) was $1,669,500. Also during October 2020, we entered into a letter agreement with such investors for the repayment of the secured convertible notes. The Company may be adversely impacted if any related party agreement or transaction is made on unfavorable terms.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and Other Securities:\nThere are a large number of shares of common stock underlying our outstanding options and warrants and the sale of these shares may depress the market price of our common stock and cause immediate and substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nAs of December 10, 2020, we had 5,661,330 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, outstanding options to purchase 362,178 shares of common stock, outstanding warrants to purchase 778,118 shares of common stock, and 3,615,486 shares available for grant under our 2020 Equity Incentive Plan. The issuance of shares upon exercise of our outstanding options and warrants will cause immediate and substantial dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may be required to repurchase certain of our warrants.\nUnder our warrants sold privately that have registration rights, in the event of a \u201cFundamental Transaction\u201d (as defined in the related warrant agreement, which generally includes any merger with another entity, the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets to another entity, or the acquisition by a person of more than 50% of our common stock), each warrant holder will have the right at any time prior to the consummation of the Fundamental Transaction to require us to repurchase the warrant for a purchase price in cash equal to the Black Scholes value (as calculated under the warrant agreement) of the then remaining unexercised portion of such warrant on the date of such Fundamental Transaction, which may materially adversely affect our financial condition and/or results of operations and may prevent or deter a third party from acquiring us.\nWe will require additional financing which may in turn require the issuance of additional shares of common stock, preferred stock or other debt or equity securities (including convertible securities) and which would dilute the ownership held by our stockholders.\nWe will need to raise funds through either debt or the sale of our shares of our common stock in order to achieve our business goals. Any additional shares issued would further dilute the percentage ownership held by the stockholders. Furthermore, if we raise funds in equity transactions through the issuance of convertible securities which are convertible at the time of conversion at a discount to the prevailing market price, substantial dilution is likely to occur resulting in a material decline in the price of your shares. Our public offerings completed in November 2014, April 2015, December 2018 and November 2019, our registered direct public offering and concurrent private placement during November 2015, our private placements completed in November 2016, June 2017, and August 2019, and our registered direct offering in December 2017 resulted in dilution to investors and future offerings of securities could result in further dilution to investors.\nIf we fail to comply with the continuing listing standards of Nasdaq, our securities could be delisted.\nOur common stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol \u201cAPDN\u201d. For our common stock to continue to be listed on Nasdaq, we must meet the current continued listing requirements. If we were unable to meet these requirements, our common stock could be delisted from Nasdaq. If our common stock were to be delisted from Nasdaq, our common stock could begin to trade on one of the markets operated by OTC Markets Group, including OTCQX, OTCQB or OTC Pink (formerly known as the \u201cpink sheets\u201d), as the case may be. In such event, our common stock could be subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules which among other things require brokers or dealers to approve investors\u2019 accounts, receive written agreements and determine investor suitability for transactions and disclose risks relating to investing in the penny stock market. Any such delisting of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for our common stock, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and less coverage of us by securities analysts, if any. Also, if in the future we were to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public or private equity markets.\nAny material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future could adversely affect investor confidence, impair the value of our common stock and increase our cost of raising capital.\nAny failure to remedy deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that may be discovered or our failure to implement new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of such controls, could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could, in turn, affect the future ability of our management to certify that internal control over our financial reporting is effective. Inferior internal control over financial reporting could also subject us to the scrutiny of the SEC and other regulatory bodies which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or stockholder litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market\u2019s confidence in our financial statements and harm our share price. Furthermore, deficiencies could result in future non-compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Such non-compliance could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions, including review by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.", "PERMNO": 15057, "SIC": 3669, "TIC": "APDN"}
