{"cik": "1602658", "company": "Investar Holding Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to risk. In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and our financial statements and the notes thereto, investors should consider the following risks when evaluating whether to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks occur, whether alone or in combination, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Additional risks that we do not presently know of or currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations cash flows and growth prospects.\nRisks Related to our Business\nAs a business operating in the financial services industry, our business and operations may be adversely affected by current economic conditions and geopolitical matters.\nOur financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the primary markets where we operate and in the U.S. as a whole. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence, limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital, increases in inflation or interest rates, high unemployment, natural disasters, or a combination of these or other factors. While economic conditions in our primary markets of south Louisiana and, following our recent acquisition of Mainland Bank (\u201cMainland\u201d), southeast Texas, generally have improved after the end of the most recent economic recession in 2009, concerns exist regarding the strength and length of the recovery. A return of recessionary conditions and/or negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Declines in real estate value and sales volumes and high unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies and a decline in demand for our products and services. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, liquidity and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve, in an attempt to help the overall economy, has among other things, kept interest rates low in the recent past through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. However, the Federal Reserve increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in December 2016, by a total of 75 basis points during 2017, and by a total of 100 basis points during 2018 and has indicated the potential for further gradual increases in the target rate depending on the economic outlook. As the federal funds rate increased, market interest rates also increased, and future increases in the federal funds rate could lead to further increases in market interest rates which may negatively impact the housing markets and the U.S. economic recovery.\nIn addition, geopolitical matters, including international political unrest, disruptions in international trade patterns, and slow growth in sectors of the global economy, as well as acts of terrorism, war and other violence could result in disruptions or volatility in the financial markets, which could reduce the value of our assets or reduce liquidity. These negative events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, including our liquidity position, and may affect our ability to access capital.\nOur business strategy includes the continuation of growth plans, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nWe have grown our business primarily through de novo branching and through the acquisition of other financial institutions. Since June 14, 2006, we have opened nine de novo branches and acquired South Louisiana Business Bank (\u201cSLBB\u201d) in 2011, First Community Bank (\u201cFCB\u201d) in 2013, Citizens Bancshares, Inc. (\u201cCitizens\u201d) and BOJ Bancshares, Inc. (\u201cBOJ\u201d) in 2017, and Mainland in the first quarter of 2019. We intend to continue pursuing a growth strategy for our business through de novo branching and to evaluate attractive acquisition opportunities that are presented to us. Our growth prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies when expanding their franchise, including the following:\n\u2022\nManagement of Growth. We may be unable to successfully maintain loan quality in the context of significant loan growth or maintain adequate management personnel and systems to oversee such growth, including internal audit, loan review and compliance personnel. Our growth may require that we implement additional policies, procedures and operating systems, and we may encounter difficulties in doing so at all or in a timely manner.\n\u2022\nOperating Results. There is no assurance that existing offices or future offices will maintain or achieve deposit levels, loan balances or other operating results necessary to avoid losses or produce profits. Our growth and de novo branching strategy necessarily entails growth in overhead expenses as we routinely add new offices and staff. Our historical results may not be indicative of future results or results that may be achieved as we continue to increase the number and concentration of our branch offices. Should any new location be unprofitable or marginally profitable, or should any existing location experience a decline in profitability or incur losses, the adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition could be more significant than would be the case for a larger company.\n\u2022\nDe Novo Branching; Branch Acquisitions. There are considerable costs involved in opening branches, and new branches generally do not generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs until they have been in operation for at least a year or more. Accordingly, our de novo branches can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until the branches reach certain economies of scale. Our expenses could be further increased if we encounter delays in opening any of our de novo branches. We may be unable to accomplish future de novo branch expansion plans due to a lack of available satisfactory sites, difficulties in acquiring such sites, increased expenses or loss of potential sites due to complexities associated with zoning and permitting processes, or other factors. We may also be unable to identify and acquire suitable operating branches. Finally, we have no assurance our de novo branches or branches that we may acquire will be successful even after they have been established or acquired, as the case may be. During the last three fiscal years, we have opened three de novo branches, and we expect to open two in 2019.\n\u2022\nExpansion into New Markets. As we grow into new markets in Louisiana, Texas and in other states, we are likely to encounter customer demographics and financial services offerings unlike those found in our current markets. In these markets we are likely to face competition from a wide array of financial institutions, including much larger, better-established financial institutions. Competition for qualified personnel in these markets may be intense, and there may be a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of and experience in the commercial banking industry in these markets. Even if we identify individuals that we believe could assist us in establishing a presence in a new market, we may be unable to recruit these individuals away from other banks or may be unable to do so at a reasonable cost. In addition, we may face difficulties in identifying and gaining access to customers. Prior to our acquisition of Mainland in the first quarter of 2019, we operated exclusively in Louisiana. With our acquisition of Mainland, we entered the greater Houston, Texas area. The financial services industry in this area is highly competitive, and the challenges of operating in two states may be greater than we anticipate.\nFailure to successfully address these issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Also, if our growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur success depends significantly on our management team, and the loss of our senior executive officers or other key employees and our inability to recruit or retain suitable replacements could adversely affect our business, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur success depends significantly on the continued service and skills of our existing executive management team. The implementation of our business and growth strategies also depends significantly on our ability to retain employees with experience and business relationships within their respective market areas, as well as on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, and our officers may terminate their employment with us at any time. Competition for employees is intense, and we could have difficulty replacing such officers with personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute our business and growth strategies and who have ties to the communities within our market areas. The loss of any of our key personnel could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nAs a community bank, our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the growth of our business.\nWe are a community bank and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. Much of our growth over the past several years has depended on attracting new customers from competing financial institutions and increasing our market share, primarily through the involvement of our employees in the communities that we serve. In addition, our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled management and employees is impacted by our reputation. A negative public opinion of our business can result from any number of activities, including our lending practices, corporate governance, and regulatory compliance, acquisitions, and actions taken by our regulators or by community organizations in response to these activities. Significant harm to our reputation could also arise as a result of regulatory or governmental actions, litigation, employee misconduct, or the activities of our customers, other participants in the financial services industry or our contractual counterparties, such as our service providers and vendors. Damage to our reputation could also adversely affect our credit ratings and access to capital markets.\nOur business is concentrated in southern Louisiana and southeast Texas, and an economic downturn affecting southern Louisiana or southeast Texas may magnify the adverse effects and consequences to us.\nWe currently conduct our operations primarily in southern Louisiana, and more specifically, in the Baton Rouge, New Orleans and Lafayette metropolitan areas. In the first quarter of 2019, we entered the greater Houston, Texas area with our acquisition of Mainland. At December 31, 2018, approximately 96% of the secured loans in our total loan portfolio were secured by properties and other collateral located in Louisiana, while approximately 69% of the loans in our loan portfolio (measured by dollar amount) were made to borrowers who live or work in either the Baton Rouge or New Orleans metropolitan area. This geographic concentration imposes a greater risk to us than to our competitors in the area who maintain significant operations outside of our selected markets. Accordingly, any regional or local economic downturn, or natural or man-made disaster, that affects southern Louisiana, southeast Texas, or existing or prospective property or borrowers in such areas may affect us and our profitability more significantly and more adversely than our more geographically diversified competitors. Deterioration in economic conditions in the markets we serve could result in one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nan increase in loan delinquencies;\n\u2022\nan increase in problem assets and foreclosures;\n\u2022\na decrease in the demand for our products and services;\n\u2022\na decrease in the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing our customers\u2019 borrowing power, the value of assets associated with problem loans and collateral coverage; and/or\n\u2022\na decrease in supply of customer deposits, which could impact our liquidity.\nMore particularly, much of our business development and marketing strategy is directed toward fulfilling the banking and financial services needs of small to medium-sized businesses. Such businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively impact our selected markets and these businesses are adversely affected, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nAdverse economic factors affecting particular industries could have a negative effect on our customers and their ability to make payments to us.\nIn addition to the geographic concentration of our markets, certain industry-specific economic factors also affect us. For example, a downturn in segments of the commercial and residential real estate industries in our markets due to adverse economic factors affecting particular industries could have an adverse effect on our customers. In addition, the energy sector, which is historically cyclical, has experienced significant volatility and a decline in oil and gas prices. For example, Brent crude prices declined from highs above $100 per barrel in mid-2014 to lows below $40 per barrel in late 2015 and early 2016. Prices generally rose to levels above $70 per barrel in the third quarter of 2018 before declining to close at $50.57 at the end of 2018, and then generally rising during the beginning of 2019. While we consider our exposure to the energy sector to not be significant, comprising approximately 2.6% of total loans at December 31, 2018, should the price of oil and gas decline further and/or remain at a low price for an extended period, the general economic conditions in our south Louisiana and southeast Texas markets could be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have a significant number of loans secured by real estate, and a downturn in the real estate market could result in losses and negatively impact our profitability.\nAt December 31, 2018, approximately 82% of our total loan portfolio had real estate as a primary or secondary component of the collateral securing the loan. The real estate provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of a default by the borrower but its value may deteriorate during the time the credit is extended. Declines in real estate values in our southern Louisiana and southeast Texas markets could significantly impair the value of the particular collateral securing our loans and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure for an amount necessary to satisfy the borrower\u2019s obligations to us. Furthermore, in a declining real estate market, we often will need to further increase our allowance for loan losses to address the deterioration in the value of the real estate securing our loans. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nCommercial real estate loans may expose us to greater risks than our other real estate loans.\nOur loan portfolio includes nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loans for individuals and businesses for various purposes, which are secured by commercial properties, as well as real estate construction and development loans. As of December 31, 2018, our nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $328.8 million, or 23% of our total loan portfolio.\nCommercial real estate loans typically depend on cash flows from the property to service the debt. Cash flows, either in the form of rental income or the proceeds from sales of commercial real estate, may be affected significantly by general economic conditions. These loans expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be liquidated as easily as residential real estate. If we foreclose on these loans, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for a one-to-four family residential property because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Additionally, nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loans generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Accordingly, charge-offs on nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios. Unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our commercial real estate loan portfolio would require us to increase our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nWe are exposed to consumer credit risk.\nHistorically, we have originated a significant number of consumer installment loans, particularly with respect to automobile finance. We are subject to credit risk resulting from defaults in payment or performance by customers for our loans, as well as loans that we sell to third parties but retain servicing rights. A weak economic environment and high unemployment rates could exert pressure on our auto loan customers resulting in higher delinquencies, repossessions and losses. There can be no assurances that our monitoring of our credit risk as it affects the value of these loans and the underlying collateral will be sufficient to prevent an effect on our profitability and financial condition.\nThere are also risks with respect to our auto lending in particular. First, as an indirect auto lender, all of our auto loans were originated by dealerships with which we have relationships. As a result, we do not have relationships directly with the borrowers and are dependent on the relationships these dealerships have with their customers to make a determination on whether or not there are factors that would cause an otherwise qualified customer to not repay the loan. In addition, federal and state laws may prohibit, limit or delay our repossession and sale of vehicles on defaulted automobile loan contracts, which will impair our ability to recover losses on these loans. Additional factors that may affect our ability to recoup the full amount due on an indirect auto loan include, among other things, our failure to perfect our security interest in the relevant vehicle, depreciation, obsolescence, damage or loss to the vehicle and the impact of federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws. Furthermore, proceeds from the sale of repossessed vehicles can fluctuate significantly based upon market conditions. A deterioration in general economic conditions could result in a greater loss in the sale of repossessed vehicles than we have historically experienced.\nIn November 2015, the Bank announced that it was exiting the indirect auto loan origination business. The Bank discontinued accepting indirect auto loan applications December 31, 2015, but continued to process and fund applications that were accepted on or before that date. The Bank will continue to service the current auto loan portfolio for its duration, which bears the risks discussed above.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio, and we may be required to further increase our provision for loan losses.\nAlthough we endeavor to diversify our loan portfolio in order to minimize the effect of economic conditions within a particular industry, management also maintains an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio. We maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate by management to absorb probable loan losses, including collateral impairment, based on our analysis of our portfolio and market environment, using relevant information available to us. Among other considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses, management considers economic conditions reflected within industry segments, the unemployment rate in our markets, loan segmentation and historical losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our allowance for loan losses as percentages of total loans and nonperforming loans was 0.67% and 158.9%, respectively. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is inherently subjective, involves a high degree of judgment and complexity, and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which are subject to material changes. In addition, loans acquired in connection with business combination transactions are measured at fair value, based on management\u2019s estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows. Because fair value measurements incorporate assumptions regarding credit risk, no allowance for loan losses related to the acquired loans is recorded on the acquisition date.\nInaccurate management assumptions, including with respect to the fair value of acquired loans, continuing deterioration of economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. Finally, if actual charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nCommercial and commercial real estate loans generally are viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or other loans or investments. These types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and other consumer loans. Because the loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of a material amount of these loans may cause a significant increase in our allowance for loan losses, non-performing assets, TDRs and/or past due loans. An increase in our allowance for loan losses, non-performing assets, TDRs, and/or past due loans could result in a loss of earnings, or an increase in loan charge-offs, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, in June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued a new accounting standard that will replace the current approach under GAAP for establishing the allowance for loan losses, which generally considers only past events and current conditions. This new standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d), requires financial institutions to project a loan\u2019s lifetime losses at origination, as opposed to the current framework which allows adjustments to the provision for loan and lease losses when losses are assessed as probable in an existing loan. As an emerging growth company, this standard will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2020. At this time, we do not know and cannot reasonably quantify the impact of the adoption of CECL from the current incurred loss method. The new standard is expected to generally result in increases to allowance levels and will require the application of the revised methodology to existing financial assets through a one-time adjustment to retained earnings upon initial effectiveness. In December 2018, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d), Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a final rule to allow a banking organization to elect to phase in the regulatory capital impact over a three-year period. A failure to effectively measure the effect of CECL may result in significant overstatement or understatement of our allowance for loan and lease losses, and in the event of an understatement, may necessitate that we significantly increase our allowance for loan and lease losses, which could adversely affect our net income.\nLack of seasoning of our loan portfolio could increase the risk of future credit defaults.\nAs a result of our growth over the past three years, a large portion of loans in our loan portfolio and of our lending relationships are of relatively recent origin. In general, loans do not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default until they have been outstanding for some period of time, a process referred to as \u201cseasoning.\u201d As a result, a portfolio of older loans will usually behave more predictably than a newer portfolio. Because a large portion of our portfolio is relatively new, the current level of delinquencies and defaults may not represent the level that may prevail as the portfolio becomes more seasoned. If delinquencies and defaults increase, we may be required to increase our provision for loan losses, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject the Company to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, the Company may implement or may acquire new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, the Company may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nThe majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and, as a result, we are subject to significant risk from changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect our net interest income as well as the valuation of our assets and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty changes in interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, competition for loans and deposits, domestic and international events, changes in the United States and other financial markets and the policies of the Federal Reserve. Our earnings depend significantly on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We expect to periodically experience \u201cgaps\u201d in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities, meaning that either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates move contrary to our position, this \u201cgap\u201d may work against us, and our earnings may be adversely affected.\nWhen interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. Additionally, an increase in the general level of interest rates may also, among other things, adversely affect our current borrowers\u2019 ability to repay variable rate loans, the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans and decrease loan prepayment rates, or could increase the cost of the Company's deposits. Conversely, a decrease in the general level of interest rates, among other things, may lead to prepayments on our loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios, which could result in decreased yields on earning assets. Volatility in interest rates may increase competition for deposits, and raise the cost of deposits. Accordingly, changes in the general level of market interest rates may adversely affect our net yield on interest-earning assets, loan origination volume and our overall results.\nAlthough our asset-liability management strategy is designed to control and mitigate exposure to the risks related to changes in the general level of market interest rates, those rates are affected by many factors outside of our control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, international disorder, instability in domestic and foreign financial markets and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. Adverse changes in the U.S. monetary policy or in economic conditions could materially and adversely affect us. We may not be able to accurately predict the likelihood, nature and magnitude of those changes or how and to what extent they may affect our business. We also may not be able to adequately prepare for or compensate for the consequences of such changes. Any failure to predict and prepare for changes in interest rates or adjust for the consequences of these changes may adversely affect our earnings and capital levels and overall results.\nIn addition, as interest rates increase, the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations could be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our results of operations. These circumstances could not only result in increased loan defaults, foreclosures and charge-offs but also necessitate further increases to the allowance for loan losses. At the same time, the marketability of the property securing a loan may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. Further, when we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income, but we continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets would have an adverse impact on net interest income. On the other hand, in a declining interest rate environment, there may be an increase in prepayments on loans as borrowers refinance their loans at lower rates. For additional information, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Interest Rate Risk.\nChanges in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR and other benchmark rates are determined could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and certain of the products we offer, such as floating-rate loans, determine their applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as LIBOR, or to an index, currency, basket or other financial metric. LIBOR and certain other benchmark rates are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority announced that the Financial Conduct Authority intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments. Certain of our LIBOR-based financial products and contracts, including, but not limited to, hedging products, debt obligations, investments and loans, extend beyond 2021. We are in the process of assessing the impact that a cessation or market replacement of LIBOR would have on these various products and contracts.\nLoss of deposits or a change in deposit mix could increase the Company's funding costs.\nDeposits are a low cost and stable source of funding. We compete with banks and other financial institutions for deposits. Funding costs could increase if the Company loses deposits and replaces them with more expensive sources of funding, customers may shift their deposits into higher cost products, or the Company may need to raise its interest rates to avoid losing deposits. Higher funding costs reduce the Company\u2019s net interest margin, net interest income and net income.\nBy engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to credit and market risk, which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nWe manage interest rate risk by utilizing derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap contracts, to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility. Hedging interest rate risk is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and constant monitoring. The effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation will generally be offset by income or loss on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged assets and liabilities. By engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to credit and market risk. If the counterparty fails to perform, credit risk exists to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative instrument. Market risk exists to the extent that interest rates change in ways that are significantly different from what was expected when we entered into the derivative agreement. The existence of credit and market risk associated with our derivative instruments could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nBreakdowns in our internal controls and procedures could have an adverse effect on us.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See Item 9A, Controls and Procedures for additional information.\nHurricanes or other adverse weather conditions, as well as man-made disasters, could negatively affect our local markets or disrupt our operations, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business is concentrated in southern Louisiana, in the Baton Rouge, New Orleans and Lafayette metropolitan areas in particular, and following the acquisition of Mainland, in the greater Houston, Texas area. Our selected markets are susceptible to major hurricanes, floods, tropical storms and other natural disasters and adverse weather, the nature and severity of which can be difficult to predict. These natural disasters can disrupt our operations, cause widespread property damage and severely depress the local economies in which we operate. For example, Hurricane Gustav in 2008 severely impacted our headquarters city of Baton Rouge, with power in many areas of the city not being restored for nearly three weeks after the hurricane. In addition, Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 and the historic flooding of Baton Rouge and surrounding areas in August 2016 had significant impacts in several markets in which we conduct business. Hurricane Harvey caused significant damage and flooding in Texas when it made landfall in August 2017. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico illustrated that man-made disasters can also adversely affect economic activity in the markets in which we operate. Any economic decline as a result of a natural disaster, adverse weather, oil spill or other man-made disaster can reduce the demand for loans and our other products and services.\nSuch events could also affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans (resulting in increased delinquencies, foreclosures and loan losses), impair the value of collateral securing such loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any such event could, therefore, result in decreased revenue and loan losses that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks in connection with any sale of loans we may conduct.\nWe have historically sold certain mortgage loans that we originate as well as pools of our consumer loans. In connection with these sales, we are typically required to make representations and warranties to the purchaser about the loans sold and the procedures under which those loans have been originated. If these representations and warranties are incorrect, we may be required to indemnify the purchaser for its losses or we may be required to repurchase part or all of the affected loans. Borrower fraud may also cause us to have to repurchase loans that we have sold. If we are required to make any indemnity payments or repurchases and do not have a remedy available to us against a solvent counterparty, we may not be able to recover our losses resulting from these indemnity payments and repurchases. Consequently, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to execute our business strategy.\nIn addition to the liquidity that we require to conduct our day-to-day operations, the Company, on a consolidated basis, and Investar Bank, on a stand-alone basis, must meet certain regulatory capital requirements. With the implementation of certain new regulatory requirements, such as the Basel III accord and the capital requirements enacted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, financial institutions will be required to establish higher tangible capital requirements. Also, we may need capital to finance acquisitions.\nOur ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nCompetition in our industry is intense, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nWe face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and have substantially greater resources than we have, including higher total assets and capitalization, a more extensive and established branch network, greater access to capital markets and a broader offering of financial services. Such competitors primarily include national, regional and community banks within the various markets in which we operate. Because of their scale, many of these competitors can be more aggressive than we can on loan and deposit pricing. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries. Many of these entities have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures than we do.\nOur industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative and regulatory changes as well as continued consolidation. The increased regulatory requirements imposed on financial institutions as well as the economic downturn in the United States in the 2007-2009 time frame, and generally slow recovery thereafter, have already resulted in the consolidation of a number of financial institutions, in addition to acquisitions of failed institutions. We expect additional consolidation to occur. Finally, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. If we are unable to successfully compete, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects will be materially adversely affected.\nThe integration of Mainland with the Company may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of this acquisition by the Company may not be realized.\nThe acquisition component of the Company\u2019s growth strategy depends on the successful integration of our acquisition of Mainland. The Company and Mainland have previously operated independently from each other. The acquisition of Mainland represents the Company\u2019s first expansion outside Louisiana. The success of the acquisition or proposed acquisition, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to successfully combine and integrate the business within the Company\u2019s projected timeframe in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt existing customer relationships or result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers.\nA number of factors could affect the Company\u2019s ability to successfully combine its business with Mainland, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe potential for unexpected costs, delays and challenges that may arise in integrating the acquisition into the Company\u2019s existing business;\n\u2022\nunexpected obstacles to the Company\u2019s ability to realize the expected cost savings and synergies from the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s ability to retain key employees and maintain relationships with significant customers and depositors of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention and resources during integration efforts;\n\u2022\nchallenges related to operating at new locations and in a new State; and\n\u2022\ndiscovery following the acquisition of previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business.\nIf the Company encounters significant difficulties in the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or proposed acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or proposed acquisition in the timeframes projected by the Company could result in increased costs and decreased revenues. This could have a dilutive effect on the combined company\u2019s earnings per share. If the Company is unable to successfully integrate the business it acquires, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may face risks with respect to future acquisitions.\nWhen we attempt to expand our business in Louisiana, Texas and other states through mergers and acquisitions, we seek targets that are culturally similar to us, have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through economies of scale or expanded services. In addition to the general risks associated with our growth plans highlighted above, acquiring other banks, businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisition and merger targets;\n\u2022\ninaccuracies in the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution;\n\u2022\nthe time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management and opening new bank locations, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u2022\nour ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention to the negotiation of a transaction;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of an impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and adverse effects on our results of operations;\n\u2022\nentry into new markets where we lack experience; and\n\u2022\nrisks associated with integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt existing customer relationships or result in decreased revenues resulting from any loss of customers.\nWith respect to the risks particularly associated with the integration of an acquired business, we may encounter a number of difficulties, such as:\n\u2022\ncustomer loss and revenue loss;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees;\n\u2022\nthe disruption of our operations and business;\n\u2022\nour inability to achieve expected cost savings and synergies;\n\u2022\nour inability to maintain and increase competitive presence;\n\u2022\ngreater than expected negative effects of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\npossible inconsistencies in standards, control procedures and policies; and/or\n\u2022\nunexpected problems with operations, personnel, technology, credit and costs, or reduced cost savings.\nIn addition to the risks posed by the integration process itself, the focus of management\u2019s attention and effort on integration may result in a lack of sufficient management attention to other important issues, causing harm to our business. Also, general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit our successful integration of an acquired business.\nWe expect to continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities that are presented to us and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur at any time. Historically, acquisitions of non-failed financial institutions involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company may not be able to complete future announced acquisitions.\nWe must generally satisfy a number of meaningful conditions before we can complete an announced acquisition of another bank or bank holding company, including federal and/or state regulatory approvals. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank or bank holding company acquisition, bank regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, financial condition and future prospects, including current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and the needs of the communities to be served. We cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted. In specific cases, we may be required to sell banks or branches, or take other actions as a condition to receiving regulatory approval. An inability to satisfy other conditions necessary to consummate an acquisition transaction, such as third-party litigation, a judicial order blocking the transaction or lack of shareholder approval, could also prevent us from completing an announced acquisition.\nIf the goodwill that we record in connection with a business acquisition becomes impaired, it could require charges to earnings, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill represents the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeded the fair value of net assets we acquired in connection with the purchase of another financial institution. We review goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset might be impaired.\nWe determine impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in our results of operations in the periods in which they become known. As of December 31, 2018, our goodwill totaled $17.4 million, $14.7 million of which was recognized in 2017 in connection with two acquisitions. While we have not recorded any such impairment charges since we initially recorded the goodwill, there can be no assurance that our future evaluations of goodwill will not result in findings of impairment and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFactors outside our control could result in impairment of or losses with respect to our investment securities.\nUnder applicable accounting standards, we are required to review our securities portfolio periodically for the presence of other-than-temporary impairment, taking into consideration current market conditions, the extent and nature of changes in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, volatility of earnings, current analysts\u2019 evaluations, our ability and intent to hold securities until a recovery of fair value, as well as other factors. Adverse developments with respect to one or more of the foregoing factors may require us to deem particular securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired, with the credit related portion of the reduction in the value recognized as a charge to the results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs. Market volatility may make it difficult to value certain securities. Subsequent valuations, in light of factors prevailing at that time, may result in significant changes in the values of these securities in future periods.\nAny of these factors could require us to recognize further impairments in the value of our securities portfolio, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods.\nA lack of liquidity could adversely affect our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. The primary source of the Bank\u2019s funds are customer deposits and loan repayments, while borrowings are a secondary source of liquidity. Our access to deposits and other funding sources in adequate amounts and on acceptable terms is affected by a number of factors, including rates paid by competitors, returns available to customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions. Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, pay dividends to our shareholders, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company may be materially and adversely affected by the creditworthiness and liquidity of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. Our Bank has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose our Bank to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our Bank\u2019s credit risk may be increased when the collateral to which it is entitled cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of its credit or derivative exposure. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party vendors, and our failure to effectively implement new technology or a disruption of service could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. We believe that improved technology allows us to serve our customers in a more efficient and less costly manner. Our ability to compete successfully to some extent depends on whether we can implement new technologies to provide products and services to our customers while avoiding significant operational challenges that increase our costs or delay full implementation of technology enhancements or new products, especially relative to our peers (many of which have greater resources to devote to technological improvements).\nAlthough new technologies enable us to enhance the products and services we offer our customers, this technology exposes us to certain risks. First, the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems is critical to our business. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing. If one of these third-party service providers terminates their relationship with us or fails to provide services to us for any reason or provides such services poorly, our business will be negatively affected. In addition, we may be forced to replace such vendor, which could interrupt our operations and result in a higher cost to us.\nCyber-attacks or other security breaches could adversely affect our operations, net income or reputation.\nAs part of our banking business, we collect, use and hold sensitive data concerning individuals and businesses with whom we have a banking relationship. Threats to data security, including unauthorized access and cyber-attacks, rapidly emerge and change, exposing us to additional costs for protection or remediation and competing time constraints to secure our data in accordance with customer expectations and statutory and regulatory requirements. The increasing sophistication of cyber-criminals makes it extremely difficult to keep up with new threats and could result in a breach of our data security. Patching and other measures to protect existing systems and servers could be inadequate, especially on systems that are being retired. Controls employed by our information technology department and third-party vendors could prove inadequate. We could also experience a breach by intentional or negligent conduct on the part of our employees or other internal sources or by merchants using our customers\u2019 debit and credit cards, software bugs or other technical malfunctions, or other causes. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. As a result of any of these threats, our computer systems and/or our customer accounts could become vulnerable to misappropriation of confidential information, account takeover schemes or cyber-fraud. Our systems and those of our third-party vendors may become vulnerable to damage or disruption due to circumstances beyond our or their control, such as from catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, network failures, and viruses and malware.\nA breach of our security that results in unauthorized access to our data could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws and expose us to a disruption or challenges relating to our daily operations as well as to data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties, customer notification requirements, significant increases in compliance and insurance costs, increases in costs for measures to minimize these risks, loss of confidence in our security measures, and reputational damage, any of which could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects, and shareholder value.\nWe have attempted to address these concerns by backing up our systems as well as retaining qualified third-party vendors to test and audit our network. However, there can be no guarantees that our efforts will be successful in avoiding material problems with our information technology and telecommunications systems. We may not be able to anticipate all cyber security breaches or implement effective preventative measures against such breaches.\nWe face significant operational and other risks related to our activities, which could expose us to negative publicity, litigation and/or regulatory action.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risks, including business continuity, process, third party, information technology, human resource, model, and fraud risks. Our fraud risks include fraud committed by external parties against the Company or our customers and fraud committed internally by our associates. Certain fraud risks, including identity theft and account takeover may increase as a result of customers' account or personally identifiable information being obtained through breaches of retailers' or other third parties\u2019 networks. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, mitigate, report and analyze these risks; however, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated, monitored or identified. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses, we may have to expend resources detecting and correcting the failure in our systems and we may be subject to potential claims from third parties and government agencies. We may also suffer severe reputational damage. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In particular, the unauthorized disclosure, misappropriation, mishandling or misuse of personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information of customers could result in significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss.\nBecause the nature of the financial services industry involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. The Company\u2019s necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process our transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or associate tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. We also may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages), which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. The Company is further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees we are) and to the risk that the Company (or our vendors\u2019) business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate.\nOur success depends on our ability to respond to the threats and opportunities of fintech innovation.\nFintech developments, such as bitcoin, have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way banks do business. Investment in new technology to stay competitive would result in significant costs and increased risks of cyber-attacks. Our success depends on our ability to adapt to the pace of the rapidly changing technological environment, which is crucial to retention and acquisition of customers. Effective July 31, 2018, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will grant limited-purpose national bank charters to fintech companies that offer bank products and services. The federal charter allows fintech companies to operate nationwide under a single set of national standards, without needing to seek state-by-state licenses or joining with brick-and-mortar banks, which could have the effect of allowing fintech companies to more easily compete with us for financial products and services in the communities we serve.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. Also, in the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans or purchase real estate to expand our facilities. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although management has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before the loan is recorded and before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards.\nWe may be subject to increased litigation which could result in legal liability and damage to our reputation.\nThe Company and the Bank have been named from time to time as defendants in litigation relating to our businesses and activities. Litigation may include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. We are also involved from time to time in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business. These matters also could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.\nIn addition, in recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed \u201clender liability.\u201d Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause significant harm to our reputation.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, which could restrain our growth and profitability.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state banking laws and regulations that governs almost all aspects of our operations, including, among other things, our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, operations and growth. These laws and regulations, and the supervisory framework that oversees the administration of these laws and regulations, are primarily intended to protect consumers, depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund and the banking system as a whole, and not shareholders and counterparties. Furthermore, new proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry, impose restrictions on our operations and our ability to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of compensation, interest rates, financial product offerings and disclosures, and have an effect on bankruptcy proceedings with respect to consumer residential real estate mortgages, among other things, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur efforts to comply with these additional laws, regulations and standards are likely to result in increased expenses and a diversion of management time and attention. The information under the heading \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in Item 1, Business, provides more information regarding the regulatory environment in which we and the Bank operate.\nThe ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 could require significant management attention and resources and subject us to more stringent regulatory requirements.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law on July 21, 2010, and the process of implementation is ongoing. This law significantly changed the then-existing bank regulatory structure and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act changes the regulatory structure to which we are subject in numerous ways, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nIt established the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the \u201cCFPB\u201d) as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve. The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards.\n\u2022\nIt increased the regulation of consumer protections regarding mortgage originations, including originator compensation, minimum repayment standards, and servicing requirements.\n\u2022\nIt required the FDIC to raise the ratio of reserves to deposits from 1.15% to 1.35% for deposit insurance purposes by September 30, 2020 and \u201coffset the effect\u201d of increased assessments on insured depository institutions with assets of less than $10.0 billion.\n\u2022\nIt limited the interchange fees payable on debit card transactions.\n\u2022\nIt contained multiple new provisions affecting corporate governance and executive compensation at all publicly traded companies.\n\u2022\nIt repealed all federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on commercial demand deposit accounts.\nThere remains significant uncertainty surrounding the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will ultimately be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and the full extent of the impact of the requirements on our operations is unclear, especially with the change from the Obama administration to the Trump administration. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, require the development of new compliance infrastructure, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements.\nFederal and state regulators periodically examine our business, and we may be required to remediate adverse examination findings.\nThe financial services industry is subject to intense scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels. The Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OFI, periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal or state banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place us into receivership or conservatorship. If we become subject to any regulatory actions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects. Failure to comply with any applicable regulations and supervisory expectations related thereto could result in fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions, reputation damage or restrictions on business.\nWe may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC deposit insurance premiums in the future.\nThe deposits of Investar Bank are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, subject it to the payment of FDIC deposit insurance assessments. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC deposit insurance. A bank\u2019s regular assessments are determined by its risk classification, which is based on its regulatory capital levels and the level of supervisory concern that it poses. The most recent economic recession, insured depository institution failures, general deterioration in banking and economic conditions, and significantly increased losses of the FDIC resulted in a decline in the designated reserve ratio of the FDIC to historical lows. To restore this reserve ratio and bolster its funding position, the FDIC imposed a special assessment on depository institutions and also increased deposit insurance assessment rates. Further increases in assessment rates are possible in the future, especially if there are additional bank failures. Any increase in deposit insurance assessment rates, or any future special assessment, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the new regulatory capital rules is uncertain.\nIn July 2013, each of the U.S. federal banking agencies adopted final rules implementing the recommendations of the International Basel Committee on Bank Supervision to strengthen the regulatory capital requirements of all banking organizations in the United States. The new capital framework, referred to as Basel III, replaced the then-existing regulatory capital rules for all banks, savings associations and U.S. bank holding companies with greater than $500 million in total assets, and all savings and loan holding companies. The final Basel III rules became effective with respect to the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015, although the rules were not fully phased in until January 1, 2019.\nThe new rules establish a new regulatory capital standard based on Tier 1 common equity, increase the minimum Tier 1 capital risk-based capital ratio, and impose a capital conservation buffer of at least 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital above the new minimum regulatory capital ratios. Failure to meet the capital conservation buffer will result in certain limitations on dividends, capital repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The rules also change the manner in which a number of our regulatory capital components are calculated compared to past calculations and the risk weights applicable to certain asset categories. Although there remains some uncertainty associated with the implementation and regulatory interpretation of the newly adopted standards, we expect that the new rules will generally require us to maintain greater amounts of regulatory capital. The new rules may also limit or restrict how we utilize our capital. A significant increase in our capital requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nThe federal banking agencies proposed a rule in November 2018 that, if adopted, would allow bank holding companies with less than $10.0 billion in total consolidated assets and limited amounts of certain assets and off balance sheet exposures and a bank leverage ratio of greater than 9% to elect to use the Community Bank Leverage Ratio (\u201cCBLR\u201d). A community banking organization electing to use the CBLR framework would have a simplified capital regime and would be considered well capitalized as long as it had a leverage ratio of greater than 9% and adequately capitalized with a leverage ratio of at least 7.5%.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, the ECOA, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice and other federal agencies enforce these laws and regulations, but private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. If an institution\u2019s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act or fair lending laws and regulations is found to be deficient, the institution could be subject to damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines, among other sanctions. In addition, the FDIC\u2019s assessment of our compliance with CRA provisions is taken into account when evaluating any application we submit for, among other things, approval of the acquisition or establishment of a branch or other deposit facility, an office relocation, a merger or the acquisition of another financial institution. Our failure to satisfy our CRA obligations could, at a minimum, result in the denial of such applications and limit our growth.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn addition, bank regulatory agencies consider the effectiveness of a financial institution\u2019s anti-money laundering activities and other regulatory compliance matters when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions. Accordingly, non-compliance with the applicable regulations could materially impair the Company\u2019s ability to enter into or complete mergers and acquisitions.\nOur use of third-party vendors and our other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.\nWe regularly use third-party vendors as part of our business. We also have substantial ongoing business relationships with other third parties. These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by our federal bank regulators. Regulation requires us to perform due diligence and ongoing monitoring and control over our third-party vendors and other ongoing third-party business relationships. In certain cases we may be required to renegotiate our agreements with these vendors to meet these requirements, which could increase our costs. We expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for deficiencies in our oversight and control of our third party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which we have these relationships. As a result, if our regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our third-party vendors or other ongoing third party business relationships or that such third parties have not performed appropriately, we could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation, any of which could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Changes in Accounting Standards and Tax Laws\nChanges in accounting standards are difficult to predict and can materially impact our financial statements.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the FASB or regulatory authorities change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. Such changes are expected to continue and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. Additionally, significant changes to GAAP may require costly technology changes, additional training and personnel, and other expenses that will negatively impact our results of operations.\nAs discussed above, in June 2016, FASB issued a new accounting standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) that will replace the current approach under GAAP for establishing the allowance for loan losses. As an emerging growth company, this standard will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2020. In December 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to provide banking organizations with an option to phase in the regulatory capital effects of the CECL model, the new accounting standard for credit losses, over three years. For more information regarding the CECL model and related risks, see our risk factor entitled \u201cOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio, and we may be required to further increase our provision for loan losses.\u201d\nChanges in tax laws and regulations and differences in interpretation of tax laws and regulations may adversely impact our financial statements.\nFrom time to time, local, state or federal tax authorities change tax laws and regulations, which may result in a decrease or increase to our net deferred tax assets. Additionally, our net deferred tax assets are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d) was enacted by Congress. The enactment of the TCJA required us to revalue and reassess our net deferred tax assets reflecting the new federal income tax rate. As a result, in December 2017 we recognized a write-down of $0.3 million in our net deferred tax assets, with a corresponding increase to income tax expense. The majority of the provisions of the TCJA took effect on January 1, 2018. The provisions that impacted the Company included the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, changes to the deductibility of certain meals and entertainment expenses, and changes to the deductibility of executive compensation. The TCJA also accelerates expensing of certain depreciable property for assets placed in service after September 27, 2017 and before January 1, 2023.\nLocal, state or federal tax authorities may interpret tax laws and regulations differently than we do and challenge tax positions that we have taken on tax returns. This may result in differences in the treatment of revenues, deductions, credits and/or differences in the timing of these items. The differences in treatment may result in payment of additional taxes, interest, penalties, or litigation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results. Potential litigation related to the Company could adversely affect the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nRisks Related to an Investment in our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which may make it difficult for investors to sell their shares at the volume, prices and times desired.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly and annual operating results, financial condition or asset quality;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic or business conditions, both domestically and internationally;\n\u2022\nthe effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve, or in laws and regulations affecting us;\n\u2022\nthe number of securities analysts covering us;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us, our competitors, or the financial services industry generally, or changes in, or failure to meet, securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial and operating performance, or lack of research reports by industry analysts or ceasing of coverage;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of companies that investors deemed comparable to us;\n\u2022\nthe average daily trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nfuture issuances of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding our competitors and/or us;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving our competitors or us; and\n\u2022\nother news, announcements or disclosures (whether by us or others) related to us, our competitors, our core market or the financial services industry.\nThe stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks have experienced significant fluctuations in recent years. In many cases, these changes have been unrelated to the operating performance and prospects of particular companies. In addition, significant fluctuations in the trading volume in our common stock may cause significant price variations to occur. Increased market volatility may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, which may make it difficult for investors to sell their shares at the volume, prices and times desired.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. While we retain this status, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of the following: (1) December 31, 2019; (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenues; (3) the date on which we have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates; or (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt over a three-year period. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions, or if we choose to rely on additional exemptions in the future. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nShares eligible for future sale could adversely affect market prices of our common stock.\nShares of our common stock eligible for future sale, including those that may be issued in any private or public offering of our common stock, as consideration in acquisition transactions, or as incentives under incentive plans, could adversely affect market prices for our common stock. As of December 31, 2018, we had 9,484,219 shares outstanding and 340,646 shares subject to options granted under our incentive plan. Because our outstanding shares of common stock either were issued in an offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) or have been held for more than one year, such shares are freely tradable, except for shares held by our affiliates (approximately 10% of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018) and 135,848 shares that represent unvested restricted shares under our incentive plan. Shares issued under our incentive plan will be available for sale into the public market, except for shares held by our affiliates. Shares held by our affiliates may be resold subject to the restrictions in Rule 144 of the Securities Act. In the future, we may issue additional shares of common stock to raise capital for growth or as consideration in acquisition transactions or for other purposes, and such shares may be registered under the Securities Act and freely tradable.\nOur dividend policy may change without notice, and our future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such cash dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. We have no obligation to continue paying dividends, and we may change our dividend policy at any time without notice to our shareholders.\nSince the Company\u2019s primary asset is its stock of Investar Bank, we are dependent upon dividends from the Bank to pay our operating expenses, satisfy our obligations and to pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock. Accordingly, any declaration and payment of dividends on common stock will substantially depend upon the Bank\u2019s earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Furthermore, consistent with our strategic plans, growth initiatives, capital availability, projected liquidity needs, and other factors, we have made, and will continue to make, capital management decisions and policies that could adversely impact the amount of dividends, if any, paid to our common shareholders.\nIn addition, there are numerous laws and banking regulations that limit our and Investar Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends. For Investar Bank, federal and state statutes and regulations require, among other things, that the Bank maintain certain levels of capital in order to pay a dividend. Further, state and federal banking authorities have the ability to restrict the payment of dividends by supervisory action. At the holding company level, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy in relation to the organization\u2019s overall asset quality, level of current and prospective earnings and level, composition and quality of capital. The guidance requires that a company inform and consult with the Federal Reserve Board prior to declaring and paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in an adverse change to its capital structure.\nOur Restated Articles of Incorporation and By-laws, and certain banking laws applicable to us, could have an anti-takeover effect that decreases our chances of being acquired, even if our acquisition is in our shareholders\u2019 best interests.\nCertain provisions of our restated articles of incorporation and our by-laws, as amended, and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our organization or conduct a proxy contest, even if those events were perceived by many of our shareholders as beneficial to their interests. These provisions, and the corporate and banking laws and regulations applicable to us:\n\u2022\nenable our board of directors to issue additional shares of authorized, but unissued capital stock. In particular, our board may issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the board;\n\u2022\nenable our board of directors to increase the size of the board and fill the vacancies created by the increase;\n\u2022\nenable our board of directors to amend our by-laws without shareholder approval;\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice for director nominations and other shareholder proposals; and\n\u2022\nrequire prior regulatory application and approval of any transaction involving control of our organization.\nThese provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, including circumstances in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium over the market price of our shares.\nOur issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of our common stock and discourage a takeover.\nOur shareholders authorized our board of directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock without any further action on the part of our shareholders. The board also has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. In the event that we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our shareholders may impede a takeover of us and prevent a transaction perceived to be favorable to our shareholders.\nHolders of the junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our common shareholders.\nIn connection with the acquisitions of FCB and BOJ, we assumed junior subordinated debentures issued by FCB and BOJ and the obligations of related trust preferred securities issued by trusts established by FCB and BOJ. At December 31, 2018, we had trust preferred securities and accompanying junior subordinated debentures with a carrying value of $5.8 million. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities of these trusts are conditionally guaranteed by us. Further, the junior subordinated debentures we issued to the trusts are senior to our shares of common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock. We have the right to defer distributions on our junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid on our common stock.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit and is subject to risk of loss.\nOur common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, an investor may lose some or all of his or her investment in our common stock.\nWe cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase programs will be fully implemented or that they will enhance long-term shareholder value. Repurchases of our shares of common stock could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our shares of common stock and will diminish our cash reserves.\nOn February 5, 2019, our board of directors approved an additional 300,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock for repurchase under a stock repurchase program, in addition to 2,288 shares remaining under the current repurchase program. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase a specific number or dollar value of our shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which could result in a decrease in the trading price of our shares of common stock. We cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. The stock repurchase program will diminish our cash reserves. In addition, repurchases of our shares of common stock through the program could affect the trading price of our shares of common stock and increase volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase program could cause the price of our common shares to be higher than it would be absent such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our common shares.", "PERMNO": 14810, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "ISTR"}
