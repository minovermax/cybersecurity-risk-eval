{"cik": "1533924", "company": "Midstates Petroleum Company, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks, or any risk described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in our other public filings, press releases and discussions with our management actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. The risks described below are the known material risk factors facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Gas Industry and Our Business\nDue to reduced commodity prices and lower operating cash flows, coupled with substantial interest payments, there is doubt about our ability to maintain adequate liquidity through 2015 and our ability to make interest payments in respect of our indebtedness.\nDuring the second half of 2014, NYMEX-WTI oil prices fell from in excess of $100 per Bbl to below $50 per Bbl, the lowest price since 2009. The substantial reduction in oil and NGL prices has caused a reduction in our forecast of available liquidity and we may not have the ability to maintain our current borrowing base under our reserve based credit facility at its current levels or generate sufficient cash flows from operations and, therefore, sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated working capital, debt service and other liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2014, we had available cash of approximately $11 million and availability under our reserve based revolving credit facility of approximately $90 million. As of December 31, 2014, payments due on our contractual obligations during the next twelve months were approximately $150 million. This includes approximately $130 million of interest payments on our senior notes and other operating expenses such as fixed drilling commitments and operating leases. We believe that our forecasted cash and available credit capacity are not expected to be sufficient to meet our commitments as they come due over the next twelve months and that we will not be able to remain in compliance with our debt covenants unless we are able to successfully increase our liquidity. A sustained material decline in oil, NGL and natural gas prices or a reduction in our oil and natural gas production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund our capital expenditure program and negatively impact our liquidity on an ongoing basis. We expect we will need to complete certain transactions, including management of our debt capital structure and potential asset sales, to have sufficient liquidity to satisfy these obligations in the long-term.\nWe are currently evaluating strategic alternatives to address our liquidity issues and high debt levels. We cannot assure you that any of these efforts will be successful or will result in cost reductions or additional cash flows or the timing of any such cost reductions or additional cash flows. We are currently reviewing our alternatives and may adopt other strategies that may include actions such as a refinancing or restructuring of our indebtedness or capital structure, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing. We cannot assure you that any refinancing or debt or equity restructuring would be possible or that additional equity or debt financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that any of our strategies will yield sufficient funds to meet our working capital or other liquidity needs, including for payments of interest and principal on our debt in the future, and any such alternative measures may be unsuccessful or may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations, which could cause us to default on our obligations.\nOur substantial indebtedness, liquidity issues and potential to seek restructuring transactions may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness, liquidity issues and potential to seek restructuring transactions may result in uncertainty about our business and cause, among other things:\n\u2022 third parties' to lose confidence in our ability to explore and produce oil and natural gas, resulting in a significant decline in our revenues, profitability and cash flow;\n\u2022 difficulty retaining, attracting or replacing key employees;\n\u2022 employees to be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other career opportunities; and\n\u2022 our suppliers, vendors, hedge counterparties and service providers to renegotiate the terms of our agreements, terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances from us.\nThese events may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nIf we are unable to repay or refinance our existing and future debt as it becomes due, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nOur existing and future debt agreements could create issues as interest payments become due and the debt matures that will threaten our ability to continue as a going concern. For example, absent any action with respect to the repayment or refinancing of our existing indebtedness or any waivers or amendments to the agreements governing our existing indebtedness, our reserve based revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature in 2018 and our senior notes are scheduled to mature in 2020 and 2021. Additionally, the borrowing base under our reserve based revolving credit facility is subject to at least semi-annual redetermination and as a result, availability thereunder could be reduced and advances in excess of the new availability would need to be repaid. We have substantial interest payments due during the next twelve months, including approximately $130 million of total interest payments due on our senior notes in 2015. If we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the revolving credit facility, the indentures governing our senior notes, or other agreements governing our indebtedness, an event of default could result, which would permit acceleration of such debt and which could result in an event of default under and acceleration of our other debt and could permit our secured lenders to foreclose on any of our assets securing such debt. Any accelerated debt would become immediately due and payable. While we will attempt to take appropriate mitigating actions to refinance any indebtedness prior to its maturity or otherwise extend the maturity dates, and to cure any potential defaults, there is no assurance that any particular actions with respect to refinancing existing indebtedness, extending the maturity of existing indebtedness or curing potential defaults in our existing and future debt agreements will be sufficient.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern.\nA substantial or extended decline in oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas, prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nThe price we receive for our oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas, heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile. The spot natural gas prices during 2014 ranged from a high of $8.15 to a low of $2.99 per MMBtu and the spot oil prices during 2014 ranged from a high of $107.95 to a low of $53.45 per Bbl. Thus far in 2015, commodity prices have continued to be depressed and volatile, with spot natural gas prices ranging from a high of $3.32 to a low of $2.62 per MMBtu and the spot oil prices ranging from a high of $53.56 to a low of $44.08 per Bbl through March 2, 2015. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future.\nThe prices we receive for our production and the levels of our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u2022 worldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022 the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n\u2022 the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u2022 political conditions in or affecting other oil and natural gas-producing countries;\n\u2022 the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;\n\u2022 the level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022 localized supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u2022 weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022 domestic, local and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022 speculation as to the future price of oil and natural gas and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;\n\u2022 price and availability of competitors' supplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022 technological advances affecting energy consumption; and\n\u2022 the price and availability of alternative fuels.\nSubstantially all of our production is currently sold to purchasers under short-term (less than 12-month) contracts at market based prices. Lower oil and natural gas prices will reduce our cash flows, borrowing ability and the present value of our reserves. If oil and natural gas prices deteriorate, we anticipate that the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, which is revised periodically, may be reduced. Lower oil and natural gas prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. Substantial decreases in oil and natural gas prices could render uneconomic a significant portion of our identified drilling locations. This may result in our having to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. As a result, a substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nWe may not be able to obtain funding under our revolving credit facility because of a decrease in our borrowing base or obtain funding in the capital markets on terms we find acceptable.\nHistorically, we have used our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund our capital expenditures and have relied on the capital markets and asset monetization transactions to provide us with additional capital for large or exceptional transactions or to refinance debt obligations. As of December 31, 2014, we have a revolving credit facility with $90 million available and a borrowing base of $525 million. The borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is subject to semiannual redeterminations in April and October and up to one additional time per six month period following each scheduled borrowing base redetermination, as may be requested by us or the administrative agent, acting on behalf of lenders holding at least two-thirds of the outstanding loans and other obligations. The next scheduled borrowing base redetermination date is April 1, 2015. Should prices for oil and natural gas remain weak or deteriorate, if we have a downward revision in estimates of our proved reserves, or if we sell oil and natural gas reserves, our borrowing base may be reduced. Any reduction in the borrowing base will reduce our available liquidity, and, if the reduction results in the outstanding amount under the facility exceeding the borrowing base, we will be required to repay the deficiency within 30 days or in six equal monthly installments thereafter, at our election. We may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory deficiency principal prepayments required under our revolving credit facility, which could result in an event of default.\nIn the future, we may not be able to access adequate funding under our revolving credit facility as a result of (i) a decrease in our borrowing base due to the outcome of a subsequent borrowing base redetermination, or (ii) an unwillingness or inability on the part of our lending counterparties to meet their funding obligations. Since the process for determining the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility involves evaluating the estimated value of some of our oil and natural gas properties using pricing models determined by the lenders at that time, a decline in those prices used, or further downward reductions of our reserves, likely will result in a redetermination of our borrowing base and a decrease in the available borrowing amount at the time of the next scheduled redetermination. In such case, we would be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base.\nVolatility in the public and private capital markets may make it more difficult to obtain funding. There is a risk that the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets may increase in the future as lenders and institutional investors may increase interest rates, impose tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt at maturity on terms similar to existing debt or at all, or reduce or cease to provide any new funding. Due to these factors, we cannot be certain that funding, if needed, will be available to the extent required, or on acceptable terms. If we are unable to access funding when needed on acceptable terms, we may not be able to fully implement our business plans, take advantage of business opportunities, respond to competitive pressures, or refinance our debt obligations as they come due, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nOur ability to access funds under our revolving credit facility is based on a borrowing base, which is subject to periodic redeterminations based on our proved reserves and commodity prices that will be determined by our lenders using the bank pricing prevailing at such time.\nOur level of indebtedness may increase and reduce our financial flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $90 million available and a borrowing base of $525 million under our revolving credit facility, $600 million in 2020 Senior Notes and $700 million in 2021 Senior Notes outstanding. In the future, we may incur significant additional indebtedness in order to make future acquisitions or to develop our properties.\nOur current level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022 causing a significant portion of our cash flows to be used to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flows for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities;\n\u2022 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022 limiting our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n\u2022 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and, therefore, such competitors may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness would prevent us from pursuing;\n\u2022 causing our debt covenants to affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry;\n\u2022 making it more likely that a reduction in our borrowing base following a periodic redetermination could require us to repay a portion of our then outstanding bank borrowings;\n\u2022 impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022 making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the indentures governing our Senior Notes.\nA high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic conditions, oil and natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control.\nIf we are unable to repay our debt out of our cash on hand, we could attempt to refinance such debt, obtain additional borrowings, sell assets or repay such debt with the proceeds from an equity offering. We cannot assure you that refinancing, additional borrowings, proceeds from the sale of assets or equity financing will be available to pay or refinance such debt. Factors that may affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock, a refinancing of our debt or a sale of assets include financial market conditions, our market value, our reserve levels and our operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing. The inability to repay or refinance our debt could have a material adverse effect on our operations and could result in a reduction in our capital program or lead us to pursue other alternatives to develop our assets.\nIn addition, our bank borrowing base is subject to periodic redeterminations on a semi-annual basis, effective October 1 and April 1 and up to one additional time per six-month period following each scheduled borrowing base redetermination, as may be requested by either us or the administrative agent under our revolving credit facility. In the future we could be forced to repay a portion of our then outstanding bank borrowings due to future redeterminations of our borrowing base. If we are forced to do so, we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments. If we do not have sufficient funds and are unable to arrange new financing, we may have to sell significant assets. Any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nOur revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our Senior Notes contains certain covenants that may inhibit our ability to make certain investments, incur additional indebtedness and engage in certain other transactions, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our future goals.\nOur revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our Senior Notes includes certain covenants that, among other things, restrict:\n\u2022 our ability to incur or assume additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u2022 issue redeemable stock and preferred stock;\n\u2022 pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022 prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022 make loans and investments;\n\u2022 create or incur liens;\n\u2022 restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022 sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022 consolidate or merge with or into another entity, or sell all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022 enter into new lines of business.\nA breach of the covenants under the indentures governing the Senior Notes or under the revolving credit facility could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. An event of default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in an acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under our credit facility would permit the lenders under the facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our revolving credit facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt.\nIn addition, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios, including a leverage ratio. All of these restrictive covenants may restrict our ability to expand or pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these and other provisions of our revolving credit facility may be impacted by changes in economic or business conditions, results of operations or events beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our revolving credit facility, in which case, depending on the actions taken by the lenders thereunder or their successors or assignees, such lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility, together with accrued interest, to be due and payable. If we were unable to repay such borrowings or interest, our lenders could proceed against their collateral. If the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness.\nWe may be unable to maintain compliance with certain financial ratio covenants of our outstanding indebtedness which could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios or to reduce our indebtedness if we are unable to comply with such ratios. As of December 31, 2014, our ratio of net consolidated indebtedness to EBITDA was 3.7:1.0 and our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.1:1.0. If liquidity concerns are not addressed in the near-term, we may breach the leverage covenant of our revolving credit facility which currently requires a maximum ratio of net consolidated indebtedness to EBITDA of 4.0:1.0 beginning with the first quarter of 2015. As of December 31, 2014, we are in compliance with our financial covenants; however, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with such terms at all times in the future. Any failure to comply with the conditions and\ncovenants in our revolving credit facility that is not waived by our lenders or otherwise cured could lead to a termination of our revolving credit facility, acceleration of all amounts due under our revolving credit facility, or trigger cross-default provisions under other financing arrangements. These restrictions may limit our ability to obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations that the restrictive covenants under our indebtedness impose on us.\nLiquidity concerns could result in a downgrade in our debt ratings which could restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, current or future financings or trade credit.\nOur ability to obtain financings and trade credit and the terms of any financings or trade credit is, in part, dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. We cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities, liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix and commodity pricing levels. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access financings or trade credit, increase our borrowing costs and potentially require us to post letters of credit for certain obligations.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our development, drilling and production activities. Our oil and natural gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, explore or develop drilling locations or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through 2D and 3D seismic data, geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. The production and operating data that is available with respect to our operating areas based on modern drilling and completion techniques is relatively limited compared to trends where multiple operators have been active for a significant period of time. As a result, we face more uncertainty in evaluating data than operators in more developed trends. For a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes, see \"-Our estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\" Our costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain before drilling commences. In addition, the application of new techniques in these trends, such as high-graded stimulation designs and horizontal completions, some of which we may not have previously employed, may make it more difficult to accurately estimate these costs. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical. Further, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects, including the following:\n\u2022 shortages of, or delays in, obtaining equipment and qualified personnel;\n\u2022 facility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022 unexpected operational events;\n\u2022 pressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022 adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022 reductions in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022 delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities;\n\u2022 title problems; and\n\u2022 limitations in the market for oil and natural gas.\n\u2022 cost associated with developing and operating oil and gas properties\nIn addition, our hydraulic fracturing operations require significant quantities of water. Regions where we operate have recently experienced drought conditions. These conditions could persist in the future, diminishing our access to water for hydraulic fracturing operations. Any diminished access to water for use in hydraulic fracturing, whether due to usage restrictions or drought or other weather conditions, could curtail our operations or otherwise result in delays in operations or increased costs.\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. If the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows was run at current strip prices, our total estimated proved reserves would be significantly below the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at December 31, 2014.\nYou should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements in effect at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions. Actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022 actual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022 actual cost of development and production expenditures;\n\u2022 the amount and timing of actual production; and\n\u2022 changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general. Prior to our corporate reorganization in April 2012 in connection with our initial public offering, we were not subject to entity level taxation. Accordingly, our standardized measure for periods prior to such reorganization does not provide for federal or state corporate income taxes because taxable income was passed through to our equity holders. However, as a result of our corporate reorganization, we are now treated as a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes and our income taxes are dependent upon our taxable income. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimates included in this report which could have a material effect on the value of our reserves.\nDue to the recent decrease in oil and natural gas prices and if prices continue to decrease, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties.\nWe use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties. Accordingly, we capitalize and amortize all productive and nonproductive costs directly associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities. Under the full cost method, the capitalized cost of oil and gas properties, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes may not exceed the \"cost center ceiling\" which is equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves, less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves computed using a discount factor of 10%, plus the costs of properties\nnot subject to amortization, plus the lower of the cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, less related income tax effects. If the net capitalized costs exceed the cost center ceiling, we recognize the excess as an impairment of oil and gas properties. At March 31, 2014, we recognized an impairment of $86.5 million, for the amount by which our net capitalized costs exceeded the cost center ceiling. This impairment does not impact cash flows from operating activities but does reduce our earnings and shareholders' equity. The risk that we will be required to recognize impairments of our oil and natural gas properties increases during periods of low commodity prices. In addition, impairments would occur if we were to experience sufficient downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or the present value of estimated future net revenues. An impairment recognized in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even if higher oil and gas prices increase the cost center ceiling applicable to the subsequent period. We could incur impairments of oil and natural gas properties in the future, particularly as a result of sustained or further decline in commodity prices.\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile. A substantial portion of our hedges are set to expire in 2015. If we choose not to replace hedges as those contracts expire, our cash flows from operations will be subjected to increased volatility.\nWe enter into hedging transactions of our oil and natural gas production revenues to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas. A substantial portion of our hedges are set to expire in 2015. As our hedges expire, more of our future production will be sold at market prices, exposing us to the fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas, unless we enter into additional hedging transactions. We may choose not to replace existing hedges as those contracts expire, which will subject our cash flows from operations to increased volatility.\nWe have incurred losses from operations during certain periods since the beginning of 2008 and may continue to do so in the future.\nWe incurred losses from operations of $407.4 million, $15.6 million and $11.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures. The uncertainty and risks described in this report may impede our ability to economically acquire and develop oil and natural gas reserves. As a result, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows provided by operating activities in the future.\nOur estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracies in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this report. See \"Summary of Oil and Gas Properties and Operations\" for information about our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nIn order to prepare our estimates, we must estimate production rates and the timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise. In addition, reserve estimates for properties that do not have a lengthy production history, including the areas in which we operate, are less reliable than estimates for fields with lengthy production histories. There can be no assurance that analysis of previous production data relating to\nthe Mississippian Lime, Anadarko Basin or Upper Gulf Coast Tertiary trend will accurately predict future production, development expenditures or operating expenses from wells drilled and completed using modern techniques. In addition, this data is partially based on vertically drilled wells, which may not accurately reflect production, development expenditures or operating expenses that may result from the application of horizontal drilling techniques.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this report. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe development of our proved undeveloped reserves in our areas of operation may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nApproximately 52% of our total estimated proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped as of December 31, 2014. Development of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Delays in the development of our reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, pursuant to existing SEC rules and guidance, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking. Accordingly, delays in the development of such reserves, increases in capital expenditures required to develop such reserves and changes in commodity prices could cause us to have to reclassify our proved undeveloped reserves as unproved reserves, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnless we conduct successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flows and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nDrilling locations that we have identified may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities.\nWe describe some of our drilling locations and our plans to explore those drilling locations in this report. Our drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a location which is ready to drill to a location that will require substantial additional interpretation. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable. Even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience\nmechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, resulting in a reduction in production from or abandonment of the well. If we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations, our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business. In sum, the cost of drilling, completing and operating any well is often uncertain, and new wells may not be productive.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled out over many years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling, which in certain instances could prevent production prior to the expiration date of leases for such locations. In addition, we may not be able to raise the amount of capital that would be necessary to drill a substantial portion of our identified drilling locations.\nOur management team has identified and scheduled certain drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage and acreage currently under option. These drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these drilling locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, the availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, gathering systems, marketing and pipeline transportation constraints, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertain factors, we do not know if the numerous drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other drilling locations. In addition, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the potential locations are obtained, the leases for such acreage will expire. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified.\nPart of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques. The results of our horizontal drilling activities are subject to drilling and completion technique risks, and actual drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production. As a result, we may incur material impairment of the carrying value of our unevaluated properties, and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline if drilling results are unsuccessful.\nRisks that we face while horizontally drilling include, but are not limited to, landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone, staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation, running our casing the entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore. Risks that we face while completing our horizontal wells include, but are not limited to, being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage. Ultimately, the success of these horizontal drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled in the Mississippian Lime, Anadarko Basin and Upper Gulf Coast Tertiary trend and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our horizontal drilling results in these trends are less than anticipated, the return on our investment in this area may not be as attractive as we anticipate. The carrying value of our unevaluated properties could become impaired, which would increase our depletion rate per Boe or result in a ceiling test impairment if there were no corresponding additions to recoverable reserves, and the value of our undeveloped acreage in this area could decline in the future.\nOur business depends on the availability of water and the ability to dispose of water. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to obtain or dispose of water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWith current technology, water is an essential component of drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle water after use, could adversely impact our operations. In some cases, water may need to\nbe obtained from new sources and transported to drilling sites, resulting in increased costs. Moreover, the introduction of new environmental initiatives and regulations related to water acquisition or waste water disposal, including produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of hydrocarbons, could limit or prohibit our ability to utilize hydraulic fracturing or waste water injection control wells.\nIn addition, concerns have been raised about the potential for earthquakes to occur from the use of underground injection control wells, a predominant method for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities. New rules and regulations may be developed to address these concerns, possibly limiting or eliminating the ability to use disposal wells in certain locations and increasing the cost of disposal in our operations. We operate injection wells and utilize injection wells owned by third parties to dispose of waste water associated with our operations.\nCompliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage, and use of water necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells or the disposal of water may increase our operating costs or may cause us to delay, curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis.\nWe utilize third-party services to maximize the efficiency of our organization. The cost of oilfield services may increase or decrease depending on the demand for services by other oil and gas companies. There is no assurance that we will be able to contract for such services on a timely basis or that the cost of such services will remain at a satisfactory or affordable level. Shortages or the high cost of frac crews, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel or oilfield services could delay or adversely affect our development and exploration operations or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business depends on transportation by truck for our oil and condensate production, and our natural gas production depends on transportation facilities that are owned by third parties.\nWe transport all of our oil and condensate production by truck, which is more expensive and less efficient than transportation via pipeline. Our natural gas production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipeline systems and processing facilities owned by third parties. Federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport oil and natural gas.\nThe disruption of third-party facilities due to maintenance, capacity constraints, or weather could negatively impact our ability to market and deliver our products. We have no control over when or if such facilities are restored or what prices will be charged. A total shut-in of production could materially affect us due to a lack of cash flows, and if a substantial portion of the production is hedged at lower than current market prices, those financial hedges would have to be paid from borrowings absent sufficient cash flows.\nOur drilling and production programs may not be able to obtain access on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise to truck transportation, pipelines, gas gathering, transmission, storage and processing facilities to market our oil and gas production.\nThe marketing of oil and gas production depends in large part on the capacity and availability of trucks, pipelines and storage facilities, gas gathering systems and other transportation, processing and refining facilities. Access to such facilities is, in many respects, beyond our control. If these facilities were unavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, we could be forced to shut in some production or delay or discontinue drilling plans and commercial production following a discovery of hydrocarbons. We rely (and expect to rely in the future) on facilities developed and owned by third parties in order to store, process, transmit and sell our oil and gas production. Our plans to develop and sell our oil and gas reserves could be materially and adversely affected by the inability or unwillingness of third parties to provide sufficient facilities and services to us on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise. The amount of oil and gas that can be produced is subject to limitation in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage to the gathering, transportation, refining or processing facilities, or lack of capacity on such facilities. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months, and in many cases, we may be provided only limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations. Additionally we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:\n\u2022 environmental hazards, such as unauthorized releases of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater contamination;\n\u2022 abnormally pressured formations;\n\u2022 mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u2022 fires, explosions and ruptures of pipelines;\n\u2022 personal injuries and death; and\n\u2022 natural disasters.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of:\n\u2022 injury or loss of life;\n\u2022 damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022 pollution and other environmental damage;\n\u2022 regulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u2022 suspension of our operations; and\n\u2022 repair and remediation costs.\nWe may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased costs of capital could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms and cost of capital, or increases in interest rates. Changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our access to capital, limit our ability to drill our identified locations and pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage. Recent disruptions and continuing volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations. We require continued access to capital. A significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results.\nWe are subject to risks in connection with acquisitions and the integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult.\nWe have previously acquired reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds from third parties, including the Eagle Property Acquisition and the Anadarko Basin Acquisition. In addition, we will continue to evaluate other acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. The successful acquisition of assets and other producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u2022 recoverable reserves;\n\u2022 future oil and natural gas prices and their appropriate differentials;\n\u2022 development and operating costs;\n\u2022 potential for future drilling and production;\n\u2022 validity of the sellers' title to the properties, which may be less than expected at the time of signing the purchase agreement; and\n\u2022 potential environmental issues, litigation and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the sellers may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an \"as is\" basis.\nSignificant acquisitions and other strategic transactions may involve other risks, including:\n\u2022 diversion of our management's attention to evaluating, negotiating and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions;\n\u2022 the challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations, information management and other technology systems and business cultures with those of our operations while carrying on our ongoing business;\n\u2022 difficulty associated with coordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u2022 an inability to secure, on acceptable terms, sufficient financing that may be required in connection with expanded operations and unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022 the challenge of attracting and retaining personnel associated with acquired operations.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business. If our senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.\nIn addition, even if we successfully integrate operations acquired in acquisitions, we may not be possible to realize the full benefits we may expect in estimated proved reserves, production volume, cost savings from operating synergies or other benefits anticipated from an acquisition or realize these benefits within the expected time frame. Anticipated benefits of an acquisition may be offset by operating losses relating to changes in commodity prices in oil and natural gas industry conditions, risks and uncertainties relating to the exploratory prospects of the combined assets or operations, failure to retain key personnel, an increase in operating or other costs or other difficulties. We may experience additional challenges integrating the assets of privately operated companies. If we fail to realize the benefits we anticipate from an acquisition, our results of operations and stock price may be adversely affected.\nThe inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to credit risk due to concentration of our oil, NGL and natural gas receivables with several significant customers. The largest purchaser of our oil, NGL and natural gas during the year ended December 31, 2014 was Plains Marketing, L.P., accounting for 28%, and for the year ended December 31, 2013 the largest purchaser of was ConocoPhillips, accounting for 28% of our total revenues for these periods. Chevron accounted for 41% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012. We generally do not require our customers to post collateral. The inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our earnings.\nTo achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil, we enter into derivative instruments for a portion of our oil, NGL and natural gas production. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" and Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our oil commodity derivative positions. We did not designate any of our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes, and we record all derivative instruments in our balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are recognized in current earnings. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments.\nDerivative instruments expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022 production is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments;\n\u2022 the counter-party to the derivative instrument defaults on its contractual obligations; or\n\u2022 there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for basis differentials.\nIn addition, our derivative arrangements limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil, NGLs and natural gas.\nLarge competitors may be attracted to our core operating areas, which may increase our costs.\nOur operations in the Mississippian Lime formation in northwestern Oklahoma, the Anadarko Basin in Texas and Oklahoma and the Upper Gulf Coast tertiary trend in Louisiana may attract companies that have greater resources than we do. These companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or identify, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. Their presence in our areas of operations may also restrict our access to, or increase the cost of, oil and natural gas infrastructure, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services, including fracking equipment and crews. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas prices. Our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. See \"Business-Competition\" for additional discussion of the competitive environment in which we operate.\nThe volatility in commodity prices and business performance may affect our ability to retain key management. The loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect our operations.\nWe depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel. In March 2014, John A. Crum resigned from the position of President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Other members of our management team also resigned in 2014. Additionally, the volatility in commodity prices and business performance may affect our ability to retain key management. The loss of the services of additional members of our senior management or technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We do not maintain, nor do we plan to obtain, any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals. Furthermore, if we are unable to find, hire and retain needed key personnel in the future, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nTitle to the properties in which we have an interest may be impaired by title defects.\nWe do not obtain title insurance and have not necessarily obtained drilling title opinions on all of our oil and natural gas properties. The existence of title deficiencies with respect to our oil and natural gas properties could reduce the value or render such properties worthless, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. A significant portion of our acreage is undeveloped leasehold acreage, which has a greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. Frequently, as a result of title examinations, certain curative work may be required to correct identified title defects, and such curative work entails time and expense. Our inability or failure to cure title defects could render some locations undrillable or cause us to lose our rights to some or all production from some of our oil and natural gas properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results if a comparable additional location to drill a development well cannot be identified.\nThe proposed U.S. federal budget for fiscal year 2015 and proposed legislation contain certain provisions that, if passed as originally submitted, will have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Obama administration's budget proposals for fiscal year 2015 contains numerous proposed tax changes, and from time to time, legislation has been introduced that would enact many of these proposed changes. The proposed budget and legislation would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently available to U.S. oil and gas companies. Among others, the provisions include: elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling and development costs in the year incurred; repeal of the percentage depletion deduction for oil and gas properties; repeal of the\ndomestic manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies; and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers. Should some or all of these provisions become law our taxes could increase, potentially significantly, after net operating losses are exhausted, which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows and could reduce our drilling activities. We do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business.\nWe are subject to various governmental regulations that may cause us to incur substantial costs.\nFrom time to time, in varying degrees, political developments and federal and state laws and regulations affect our operations. In particular, price controls, taxes and other laws relating to the oil and natural gas industry, changes in these laws and changes in administrative regulations have affected, and in the future could affect, oil and natural gas production, operations and economics. We cannot predict how agencies or courts will interpret existing laws and regulations or the effect of these adoptions and interpretations may have on our business or financial condition.\nOur business is subject to laws and regulations promulgated by federal, state and local authorities relating to the exploration for, and the development, production and marketing of, oil and natural gas, as well as safety matters. Legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations. The discharge of oil, natural gas or other pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to the government, and third parties and may require us to incur substantial costs of remediation.\nOur sales of oil and gas may expose us to extensive regulation.\nThe FERC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Trade Commission hold statutory authority to monitor certain segments of the physical energy commodities markets relevant to our business. These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets. With regard to our physical sales, if any, of oil and gas, we are required to observe the market-related regulations enforced by these agencies.\nOur operations are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration, production and development operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, completion and production activities, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. We may be required to make significant capital and operating expenditures to prevent releases, manage wastewater discharges and control air emissions or perform remedial or other corrective actions at our wells and properties to comply with the requirements of these environmental laws and regulations or the terms or conditions of permits issued pursuant to such requirements. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, loss of our leases, incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations.\nThere is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and other hazardous substances and wastes, as a result of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and because of\nhistorical operations and waste disposal practices at our leased and owned properties. Spills or other releases of regulated substances, including such spills and releases that occur in the future, could expose us to material losses, expenditures and liabilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations. Under certain of such laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination, regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination and even if our operations met previous standards in the industry at the time they were conducted.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities, air emissions control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our industry in general in addition to our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. For example, in 2012, the EPA published final rules that subject certain oil and natural gas sources, including production operations, to regulation under the NSPS and NESHAP programs that, among other things, require performance of green completions on certain fractured and re-fractured natural gas wells and establish specific requirements regarding emissions from certain production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. In a more recent example, in December 2014, the EPA published a proposed regulation that it expects to finalize by October 1, 2015 that would seek to reduce the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone to between 65 and 70 ppb for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards. Compliance with these or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact our business. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.\nBased on the EPA's determination that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes, the EPA has regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish pre-construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet \"best available control technology\" standards that typically will be established by the states. In addition, the EPA has adopted regulations requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHGs from certain sources in the United States, including, among others, certain onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities.\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and a number of states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. For example, in January 2015, the Obama Administration announced plans for the EPA to issue final standards in 2016 that would reduce methane emissions from new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs, additional operating restrictions or delays, which could adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We routinely utilize hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our oil and natural gas drilling and completion programs. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions or similar state agencies, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has issued final CAA regulations governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing; announced its intent to propose in the first half of 2015 effluent limit guidelines that wastewater from shale gas extraction operations must meet before discharging to a treatment plant; and issued in May 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the BLM issued a revised proposed rule containing disclosure requirements and other mandates for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and the agency is now analyzing comments to the proposed rulemaking and is expected to promulgate a final rule in the first half of 2015. Compliance with these requirements could increase our costs of development and production, which costs may be significant.\nFrom time to time, Congress has considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. Moreover, some states, including Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma, where we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations under certain circumstances. States could elect to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, such as the State of New York announced in December 2014. In addition, local government may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, and experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves.\nIn addition, there are also certain governmental reviews underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. For example, the White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices. Also, the EPA is pursuing a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater and is expected to issue a draft report for public comment and peer review sometime in the first half of 2015. These existing or any future studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise.\nOur operations are dependent on our rights and ability to receive or renew the required permits and other approvals from governmental authorities and other third parties.\nPerformance of our operations require that we obtain and maintain numerous environmental and land use permits and other approvals authorizing our regulated activities. A decision by a governmental authority or other third party to deny, delay or restrictively condition the issuance of a new or renewed permit or other approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or other approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to initiate or continue operations at the affected location or facility. Expansion of our existing operations is also predicated on securing the necessary environmental or land use permits and other approvals, which we may not receive in a timely manner or at all.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices.\nOn July 21, 2010 new comprehensive financial reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\"), was enacted that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, including us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC, the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. Although the CFTC has finalized certain regulations, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished.\nIn October 2011, the CFTC issued regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. The initial position limits rule was vacated by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2012. However, in November 2013, the CFTC proposed new rules that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for, or linked to, certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and exchange trading. To the extent we engage in such transactions or transactions that become subject to such rules in the future, we will be required to comply or to take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires that regulators establish margin rules for uncleared swaps. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exceptions to the mandatory clearing and margin requirements for swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks, the application of the requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also may require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty.\nAdditionally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory requirements upon our business will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including from swap recordkeeping and reporting requirements, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, and reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts. If we\nreduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nBecause we are a relatively small company, the requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, may strain our resources, increase our costs and divert management attention, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company with listed equity securities, we need to comply with new laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, related regulations of the SEC, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and the requirements of the NYSE. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements will occupy a significant amount of time of our board of directors and management and will significantly increase our costs and expenses. We are required to:\n\u2022 institute a more comprehensive compliance function;\n\u2022 design, establish, evaluate and maintain a system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u2022 comply with rules promulgated by the NYSE;\n\u2022 prepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws;\n\u2022 establish new internal policies, such as those relating to disclosure controls and procedures and insider trading;\n\u2022 involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities; and\n\u2022 establish an investor relations function.\nIn addition, being a public company subject to these rules and regulations could require us, in the future, to accept less director and officer liability insurance coverage than we desire or to incur substantial costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract new or additional qualified members to our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nWe do not intend to pay, and we are currently prohibited from paying, dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Additionally, we are currently prohibited from making any cash dividends pursuant to the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our Senior Notes. Consequently, your only\nopportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us will be if you sell your common stock at a price greater than you paid for it.\nWe are currently controlled by First Reserve, and First Reserve and Riverstone collectively hold a majority of the voting power of our common stock and certain actions by us will require the consent of First Reserve or Riverstone. Their interests as equity holders may conflict with the interests of our other shareholders or our noteholders.\nFirst Reserve currently owns an economic interest in us through FR Midstates Interholding LP (\"FRMI\"), which owns approximately 39% of our shares of common stock and is controlled by First Reserve. Eagle Energy, which is controlled by Riverstone Holdings, LLC (\"Riverstone\"), holds Series A Preferred Stock issued as consideration in the Eagle Property Acquisition. On a pro forma basis following conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock at a conversion price of $11.00, FRMI and Riverstone will own 26% and 33% of our shares of common stock, respectively.\nWhile they hold these interests, these entities will have significant influence over our operations, will have representatives on our board of directors and have significant influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership will limit the ability of our stockholders to influence corporate matters, and as a result, actions may be taken that our shareholders may not view as beneficial.\nIn addition, we, FRMI and certain of our other stockholders have entered into a stockholders' agreement that permits FRMI to designate certain of our director nominees and prohibits us from engaging in certain transactions without the written consent of FRMI.\nThe stockholders' agreement provides that the following actions by us require the consent of FRMI:\n\u2022 incurrence of debt that would result in a total net indebtedness to EBITDA ratio in excess of 2.50:1;\n\u2022 authorization, creation or issuance of any equity securities (other than pursuant to compensation plans approved by the compensation committee or in connection with certain permitted acquisitions);\n\u2022 redemption, acquisition or other purchase of any of our securities (other than certain repurchases from employees and directors);\n\u2022 amendment, repeal or alteration of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022 any acquisition or disposition (where the amount of consideration exceeds $100 million in a single transaction or $200 million in any series of transactions during a calendar year);\n\u2022 consummation of a \"change in control\" transaction;\n\u2022 adoption, approval or issuance of any \"poison pill\" or similar rights plan; and\n\u2022 entry into any plan of liquidation, dissolution or winding-up.\nThese actions by us require the consent of FRMI until the earlier of (i) receipt by our board of directors of FRMI's written election to waive its rights, (ii) the date FRMI ceases to hold at least 35% of our outstanding common stock, (iii) the third anniversary of the closing of our initial public offering or (iv) the date on which there are no directors nominated by FRMI serving as members of our board of directors.\nThe terms of the Series A Preferred Stock permit Riverstone to designate one of our director nominees, who must be an employee of Riverstone or one of its affiliates, and prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions without the consent of Riverstone, including the following actions:\n\u2022 the creation or issuance of any class of capital stock senior to or on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u2022 the redemption, acquisition or purchase by us of any of our equity securities, other than a repurchase from an employee or director in connection with such person's termination or as provided in the agreement pursuant to which such equity securities were issued;\n\u2022 any change to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws that adversely affects the rights, preferences, privileges or voting rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u2022 acquisitions or dispositions for which the amount of consideration exceeds 20% of our market capitalization in any single transaction or 40% of our market capitalization for any series of transactions during a calendar year;\n\u2022 entering into certain transactions with affiliates, other than transactions that do not exceed, in the aggregate, $10 million in any calendar year;\n\u2022 certain corporate transactions unless the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock would receive consideration consisting solely of cash and/or marketable securities with an aggregate fair market value equal to or greater than the liquidation preference on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock; and\n\u2022 any increase or decrease in the size of our board of directors.\nAs a result of FRMI's and Riverstone's equity ownership or voting power, director nominees and consent rights, our ability to engage in financing transactions or other significant transactions, such as a merger, acquisition, disposition or liquidation, may be limited. In connection with such transactions, conflicts of interest could arise between us and FRMI or Riverstone, and any conflict of interest may be resolved in a manner that does not favor us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision renouncing our interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities, which could adversely affect our business or prospects.\nConflicts of interest could arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and First Reserve and its affiliates, including its portfolio companies, on the other hand, concerning among other things, potential competitive business activities or business opportunities. First Reserve is a private equity firm in the business of making investments in entities primarily in the global energy sector. As a result, First Reserve's existing and future portfolio companies which it controls may compete with us for investment or business opportunities. These conflicts of interest may not be resolved in our favor.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any business opportunity that may be from time to time presented to First Reserve or its affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, agents, shareholders, members, partners, affiliates and subsidiaries (other than us and our subsidiaries) or business opportunities that such parties participate in or desire to participate in, even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so, and no such person shall be liable to us for breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a director or officer or controlling stockholder or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person pursues or acquires any such business opportunity, directs any such business opportunity to another person or fails to present any such business opportunity, or information regarding any such business opportunity, to us unless, in the case of any such person who is our director or officer, any such business opportunity is expressly offered to such director or officer solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer.\nAs a result, First Reserve or its affiliates may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and may direct such opportunities to other businesses in which they have invested, in which case we may not become aware of or otherwise have the ability to pursue such opportunity. Further, such businesses may choose to compete with us for these opportunities. As a result, our renouncing our interest and expectancy in any business opportunity that may be from time to time presented to First Reserve and its affiliates could adversely impact our business or prospects if attractive business opportunities are procured by such parties for their own benefit rather than for ours.\nWe are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the NYSE rules and, as a result, qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nRiverstone, First Reserve and certain of our stockholders, including Stephen P. McDaniel (a former member of our Board of Directors) and members of our executive management team, collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding voting stock and we are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the NYSE corporate governance standards. Under the NYSE rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a \"controlled company\" and may elect not to comply with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\n\u2022 a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022 the nominating and corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities;\n\u2022 the compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022 there be an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.\nThese requirements will not apply to us as long as we remain a \"controlled company.\" We may utilize some or all of these exemptions.", "PERMNO": 16442, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "AMPY"}
