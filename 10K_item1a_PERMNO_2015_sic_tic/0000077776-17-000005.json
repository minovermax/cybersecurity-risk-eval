{"cik": "77776", "company": "PHH CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Strategies\nAny actions resulting from the strategic review process, and our efforts towards executing these actions, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows, and there can be no assurance that such actions will be beneficial to our shareholders.\nWe intend to take the following actions resulting from the conclusion of our strategic review: (i) executing the sales of our MSR assets, (ii) exiting the PLS business, including consummating transactions with LenderLive; and (iii) executing the transaction to sell certain assets in our Home Loans joint venture, which would include exiting our future interest and involvement in the operations and results of that business. If we complete these actions, we intend to operate as a smaller, less capital intensive business that is focused on subservicing and portfolio retention services. See further discussion of these actions in \"Part II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Executive Summary\" of this Form 10-K.\nWe may be unable to fully or successfully execute or implement our intended strategic actions, in whole or in part, or within the projected time frame. Additionally, there can be no assurances that these actions will have the impact that we intend on our financial position, cash flows, and results of operations. While we have assessed the potential value that could be realized, as well as the potential costs that could be incurred, as a result of these actions, our assessments and estimates may differ materially from actual costs and the value realized, if such actions are pursued. Any such actions could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and cash flows, and may not be beneficial to our shareholders.\nOur efforts towards executing our intended strategic actions could cause management distractions and disruptions in our business, and exposes us to risks including, but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nWe have diverted, and will continue to divert, significant management resources and attention in our efforts to execute strategic actions, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nWhile we have assessed and estimated the potential costs associated with each strategic action and the estimated cost of advisors, lawyers and consultants to complete our strategic actions, our assessments and estimates may differ materially from actual costs and the value realized. Factors that drive this uncertainty include, among other factors, employee attrition, the expected timing of related actions, contractual complexities and the effects of income taxes.\n\u2022\nWe may encounter difficulty in retaining key employees who may be concerned about their future roles with the Company. If such key employees leave the Company, we may encounter difficulty recruiting qualified replacements. Our unique business model and the specialized knowledge required to fulfill our operations exposes us to significant retention risk. If we are unsuccessful in retaining key employees, or attracting talent during our transition period, we may suffer increased costs to staff our business, difficulties in executing upon our strategic actions and potential contractual penalties or fees if we are unable to meet our obligations.\n\u2022\nWe need to re-engineer our overhead costs to an appropriate level to allow our continuing business to be properly supported, while maintaining the appropriate level of overhead to support execution of transactions and business transitions, sustain our ongoing client relationships and to maintain compliance with all applicable legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements of our business. There can be no assurances that we will be able to reduce our overhead structure to a profitable scale, or that we will be successful in managing the risks of this effort.\n\u2022\nAny disruptions in or uncertainty around our business could affect our relationships with customers and/or other counterparties, may have negative impacts on our ability to obtain or renew financing, among other impacts.\n\u2022\nWe face risks related to our ability to successfully transition our assets and businesses through these transactions, including steps required to transition the performance of certain processes to LenderLive and to maintain compliance and internal and operational controls during the transition period.\nAll of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nAs a result of our strategic review, we intend to transition to a less capital intensive business focused on subservicing and portfolio retention services. While we intend to return excess capital to our shareholders after, and assuming, the execution of our asset sale transactions, we believe the market capitalization of the Company will be reduced after we complete all of the actions resulting from the strategic review. Furthermore, there may be a limited market for our common stock, with less market liquidity, after the execution of these actions.\nOur continuing operations have not been profitable over the past three years, and we intend to implement strategic actions and change the focus of our business to improve our financial results. We may not be able to fully or successfully execute or implement our business strategies or achieve our objectives, and our actions taken may not have the intended result.\nWe intend to take the following actions resulting from the conclusion of our strategic review: (i) executing the sales of our MSR assets; (ii) exiting the PLS business; and (iii) executing the transaction to sell certain assets in our Home Loans joint venture, which would include exiting our future interest and involvement in the operations and results of that business. If we complete these actions, we intend to operate as a smaller, less capital intensive business that is focused on subservicing and portfolio retention services. See further discussion of these actions in \"Part II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Executive Summary\" of this Form 10-K.\nWe expect to take further actions to achieve sustained profitability, and increase the strategic flexibility, for our remaining subservicing and portfolio retention business, including re-engineering our overhead and cost structure to allow our business to be properly supported, and to seek growth in our subservicing and portfolio retention businesses. However, the competitive nature of the subservicing business and related risks creates certain challenges that we will need to manage, including natural runoff of servicing units, our existing significant client concentrations, and short-term contractual arrangements with certain clients which provide them with termination rights at any time without cause. Also, market factors such as higher interest rates, evolving regulations, and potentially volatile capital market conditions may adversely impact demand for MSRs by non-bank investors and create a more challenging environment for subservicing.\nTo achieve our financial objectives for this new business, we need to realize our cost re-engineering, subservicing growth, and portfolio retention improvement assumptions. There can be no assurances that we will execute these actions, or that the execution of these actions will achieve the intended results. The achievement of our goals is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally (including market, credit, operational, and legal and compliance risks) and the inherent difficulty associated with implementing these strategic objectives. Furthermore, our success is dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our management team and our ability to negotiate with third parties.\nThe amount of capital returned to shareholders, if any, as a result of our strategic actions may be less than our expectations. Furthermore, there can be no assurances about the method, timing or amounts of any such distributions.\nThere can be no assurances that we will return capital to shareholders, or that any amounts returned will be distributed in any prescribed time frame. The amount of capital available for distribution and the method and timing of such distributions, if any, will depend on several factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe execution of the sales of our MSRs, including the receipt of required approvals, the time required to obtain approvals, and the total proceeds realized based on the portfolio composition as of each future transfer date;\n\u2022\nvalue realized from monetizing our investment in the PHH Home Loans joint venture, including the successful execution of related agreements and underlying transactions, and the timing of the related transactions;\n\u2022\nthe successful execution of our PLS exit, including the amounts of realized exit costs and operating losses, and our progress towards completing the exit of that business;\n\u2022\nactual amounts of future cash outflows, including costs incurred for transactions and restructuring, required payments for our unsecured term debt and realized tax amounts;\n\u2022\nthe outcomes of contingencies, including our legal and regulatory matters, loan repurchases, MSR sale indemnifications, and other contingencies; and\n\u2022\nworking capital and contingent cash requirements of the remaining business.\nIn addition, the method, timing and amount of any returns of capital will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on market and business conditions, the market price of our Common stock and our overall capital structure and liquidity position.\nOur decision to exit our Private Label client agreements will involve a significant amount of restructuring costs, and we have risks specific to our exit plans. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that such action will be as beneficial to shareholders as if we had not taken such action.\nOur Company has historically differentiated itself in the market as an outsourced mortgage banking services provider to such financial institutions through our PLS channel. This business represented 79% of our total loan closings for the year ended December 31, 2016 (based on dollars). Despite having completed amendments to improve the economics of our PLS agreements, we have not been able to achieve profitable scale within this business for reasons including, but not limited to, the current regulatory environment for mortgage originations, increased regulatory related costs associated with being a Technology Services Provider under the Bank Services Company Act, increased regulatory scrutiny for our financial institution clients and related persistent high costs of compliance and contractual requirements to customize the business for each client. In addition, we have been faced with recent client contract terminations, which further negatively affects our ability to achieve profitable scale. For these reasons, as an outcome of our strategic review process, we announced in November 2016 that we intend to exit the PLS channel.\nRisks specific to our plan to exit PLS include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nWe may not complete the exit in our anticipated time frame, which may be driven by our need to negotiate the exit of our agreements with PLS clients, as certain existing client agreements currently extend beyond our intended exit date. Any failures to meet our intended exit time frame would result in continued operating losses above our current estimate, and such losses may be material.\n\u2022\nOur estimate of costs to exit the PLS business includes our forecast of the net loss of operating the business through the exit of the business, severance and retention costs, and facility and other costs. However, our actual costs incurred through this process may significantly exceed our current estimates. Factors that drive significant uncertainty around the total amount of costs include our ability to: (i) negotiate terms of certain contracts; (ii) meet the timeline of the exit process; (iii) satisfy the contractual and regulatory requirements of the business during the wind-down period; and (iv) our expectations of origination volumes and costs during the exit period, among other factors.\n\u2022\nOur ability to satisfy the contractual requirements of our PLS agreements and regulatory compliance requirements during the exit period. Factors that drive risk around our ability to fulfill these requirements include, but are not limited to: (i) our ability to maintain adequate staffing levels; (ii) our reliance on outsourcing arrangements with LenderLive to fulfill substantially all of these obligations, including the risk if LenderLive does not meet their obligations to us; and (iii) our change management decisions related to maintaining and updating our systems and compliance infrastructure, in anticipation of our intended exit date.\nAll of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur evaluation of strategic alternatives for the PLS business included our assessment of the expected net present value of the estimated future operating losses of the business versus the costs we expect to realize to exit the business. Our decision to exit the business was reliant on the underlying estimates, and there can be no assurances that our exit of the PLS business will be as beneficial to shareholders as if we had not taken such action.\nWe have entered into agreements to sell certain assets of PHH Home Loans and to monetize our investment in the joint venture. The transaction contains a number of pre-closing conditions and is subject to PHH Corporation shareholder approval. There can be no assurance that the Company will complete the execution of these transactions or that the net proceeds realized upon the sale will equal the current estimate.\nWe have entered into agreements to sell certain assets of PHH Home Loans and to monetize our investment in the joint venture may not be executed in full, or at all, or within our anticipated time frame. The agreements related to this transaction contain a number of pre-closing conditions which must be met, including, but not limited to, mortgage licensing requirements (on the part of the buyer), PHH stockholder approval, the execution of a portion of the New Residential MSR sales, the receipt of agency approvals, the acceptance by certain PHH Home Loans employees (including loan originators) who receive employment offers from the buyer, among other conditions. Furthermore, we may not realize the value anticipated from selling our interests.\nDue to the pre-closing conditions and closing dates that are expected to occur over a series of time, we are exposed to a higher risk of employee turnover and other business disruptions as a result of the uncertainty and transitions for this business. We also face liquidity risk during the transition of this entity, as certain counterparties to our PHH Home Loans agreements, including our warehouse and loan sales agreements, may elect to not fulfill existing agreements due to the pending changes in the entity.\nAny of the foregoing could impair our ability to complete the joint venture transactions and could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur contractual arrangements related to the PHH Home Loans joint venture provide Realogy with termination rights upon the occurrence of certain events. Particularly, in the event the PHH Home Loans asset sale is not consummated for certain reasons, Realogy may accelerate its rights to terminate the PHH Home Loans joint venture and related agreements.\nPHH Home Loans is a joint venture that was formed for the purpose of originating and selling mortgage loans that are primarily sourced from Realogy's owned real estate brokerage business. In February 2017, we executed agreements to sell certain assets of PHH Home Loans and entered into a JV Interests Purchase Agreement to purchase Realogy's 49.9% ownership interests in the PHH Home Loans joint venture.\nRealogy had existing termination rights as specified in the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement, which have been modified by the JV Interests Purchase Agreement as noted below:\nTermination rights with Two-years notice or For cause. The terms of the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement executed in 2005 provides Realogy with the right at any time to give us two years notice of its intent to terminate its interest in PHH Home Loans. In addition, the Strategic Relationship Agreement and the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement outline certain terms and events that would give Realogy the right to terminate the PHH Home Loans joint venture for cause.\nUpon a termination of the PHH Home Loans joint venture by Realogy or its affiliates (whether for cause or upon two years\u2019 notice without cause), Realogy will have the right either: (i) to require that we or certain of our affiliates purchase all of Realogy\u2019s interest in PHH Home Loans at the applicable purchase price set forth in the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement or (ii) to cause us to sell our interest in PHH Home Loans at the applicable sale price set forth in the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement to an unaffiliated third party designated by certain of Realogy\u2019s affiliates. If we were required to purchase Realogy\u2019s interest in PHH Home Loans, such purchase could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. Additionally, any termination of the PHH Home Loans joint venture will also result in a termination of the Strategic Relationship Agreement and our other agreements and arrangements with Realogy.\nConditional Waiver of Two-Year Notice. The JV Interests Purchase Agreement executed in February 2017 modifies Realogy's contractual termination rights that were established in the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement (which are outlined above). The transactions involving PHH Home Loans may be terminated if a specified portion of the MSR sale to New Residential is not consummated by September 1, 2017 under certain specified circumstances and, upon such termination, PHH would be obligated to pay a termination fee and would be deemed to have waived: (i) any restrictions under the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement that prohibit Realogy from entering into any joint venture with third parties; and (ii) the two-year notice requirement with respect to Realogy\u2019s right to terminate PHH Home Loans joint venture.\nIn addition to Realogy\u2019s rights under the JV Interests Purchase Agreement as described in the preceding paragraph, if the transactions involving PHH Home Loans are terminated for any reason that does result in a waiver of the two-year notice requirement, Realogy may still exercise its existing right under the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement to terminate the joint venture on two years notice. Any such termination of the PHH Home Loans joint venture would also result in a termination of the Strategic Relationship Agreement and our other agreements and arrangements with Realogy, which may impact the enterprise value of PHH Home Loans and could materially and adversely impact its operations since the majority of the business of that entity, and our Real Estate channel, are derived from our relationship with Realogy.\nOur agreements to sell substantially all of our capitalized MSRs are subject to various approvals, including regulatory approvals, shareholder approval (for the New Residential transaction), approvals from certain origination sources and investors, as well as other closing requirements, and may not be completed as anticipated, or at all.\nAs an outcome of our strategic review, we announced a series of transactions to sell substantially all of our capitalized Mortgage servicing rights (collectively, the \u201cMSR transactions\u201d).\nLakeview transaction. In November 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our GNMA MSRs and related advances to Lakeview. As of December 31, 2016, the portfolio committed under this sale agreement represented 16% of our total MSR\nasset (based on UPB). We completed the sale of a portion of these MSRs in February 2017; however, the sale of the remaining population of MSRs committed under this agreement continues to be subject to approvals of clients who were the origination source of the MSRs.\nNew Residential transaction. On December 28, 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our entire portfolio of MSRs and related advances in each case as of October 31, 2016, excluding the GNMA MSRs pending sale to Lakeview, to New Residential. As of December 31, 2016, the portfolio committed under this sale agreement represents 83% of our total MSR asset. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the MSR sale agreement is subject to the approvals of PHH Corporation shareholders, the GSEs and private mortgage loan investors, as well as other customary closing requirements. Further, the sale of 33% of the MSRs underlying this agreement are subject to the approval of clients who were the origination source of the MSRs.\nIn addition, the New Residential transaction provides certain termination rights to New Residential and to us. If the Sale Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, including with respect to a competing proposal, we will pay New Residential a termination fee equal to three and a half percent of the purchase price for the MSR portfolio. Furthermore, the termination of the Sale Agreement could result in the termination of the transactions contemplated by the JV Asset Purchase Agreement and JV Interests Purchase Agreement. If certain material adverse events occur with respect to us prior to the initial sale date, New Residential has the right to terminate the subservicing agreement and, upon any exercise of such termination right, we would have the option to either sell the MSR portfolio on a subservicing-released basis or pay a $10 million termination fee.\nThe total proceeds realized from the MSR transactions are contingent upon receiving required approvals, and are based on the portfolio as of each future transfer date. Therefore, the portfolio performance between transaction and settlement dates, including realized runoff, will reduce the total proceeds available from this transaction. Furthermore, in addition to the GSEs and PLS clients, there are several hundred other origination sources (such as correspondents and credit unions) and private loan investors from whom consent is needed to sell the MSRs related to their specific relationship. There can be no assurances that we will receive any specific amount of consents required from the GSEs, private loan investors or PLS clients and other origination sources.\nWe are subject to various risks if the MSR transactions do not close in full, in part, when contemplated, or in accordance with their current terms, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nPrice Risk. If the MSR transactions do not close in accordance with its negotiated terms, we may not be able to negotiate another transaction for this asset at all, or to negotiate a sale for this asset similar to the expected proceeds from the current agreements.\n\u2022\nHedging & Interest Rate Risks. The fair value of our MSRs is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates, as borrower prepayment patterns are driven by the relative changes in mortgage interest rates. The MSR transaction with New Residential fixes the prices that we expect to realize at future transfer dates. In contemplation of these transactions, in December 2016, we significantly reduced our MSR-related derivative hedge coverage. As a result, we are subject to substantial risk that we may incur significant losses in the market value of the asset that we may not have incurred, other than for our decisions to cease hedging in anticipation of this transaction.\nThe results of our Mortgage Servicing segment, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be subject to substantial volatility from changes in interest rates, as a result of our recent decision to reduce hedge coverage.\nAll of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur remaining business will be focused on subservicing activities, and we have significant client concentration risk related to the percentage of subservicing from agreements with Pingora Loan Servicing, LLC, HSBC, and Morgan Stanley. Further, the terms of a substantial portion of our subservicing agreements allow the owners of the servicing to terminate the subservicing agreement without cause, or to otherwise significantly decrease the number of loans we subservice on their behalf at any time.\nAs a result of our strategic decisions related to our Mortgage Production origination channels, our remaining business will be focused on subservicing and related portfolio retention activities.\nOur subservicing portfolio is subject to runoff, meaning that the loans serviced by us under subservicing agreements may be repaid in full prior to maturity. As a result, our ability to maintain the size of our subservicing portfolio depends on our ability to enter into agreements for additional subserviced populations with new or existing clients.\nFurther, our subservicing business has substantial risk with respect to the current client concentrations and the termination rights contained in the underlying agreements, as discussed further below.\nConcentration risk. We have significant client concentration risk related to the percentage of our subservicing portfolio that is under agreements with a small group of clients. As of December 31, 2016, our subservicing portfolio (by units) related to the following client relationships: 42% from Pingora Loan Servicing, LLC, 22% from HSBC and 14% from Morgan Stanley. Further, our agreement to sell the majority of our capitalized MSRs to New Residential contains a three-year subservicing term, subject to certain early transfer and termination rights for New Residential; if the sale is approved and executed, we would also have an additional significant concentration risk with respect to that counterparty.\nTermination Rights. The terms of a substantial portion of our subservicing agreements allow the owners of the servicing to terminate the subservicing agreement without cause, or to otherwise significantly decrease the number of loans we subservice on their behalf, at any time, without cause, and with limited notice and negligible compensation.\nOur subservicing relationships may be negatively impacted by our intended exit of the PLS origination channel; two of our top three subservicing clients are currently PLS clients, and such clients may elect to transfer their subservicing relationships to other counterparties upon sourcing a new origination services provider. Further, the owners of the servicing rights may elect to sell their MSRs related to some or all of the loans we subservice on their behalf, which could lead to a termination of our subservicing agreements with respect to such loans and a related decrease in our revenues from subservicing.\nAs previously disclosed, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we realized client-driven reductions in our subservicing portfolio due to: (i) Merrill Lynch\u2019s announced intent to insource their servicing activities and (ii) HSBC\u2019s sale of a population of MSRs relating to loans that we currently subservice. In the fourth quarter of 2016, our subservicing portfolio declined by approximately 211,000 units, or 44%, primarily driven by those actions.\nFurther terminations or material reductions in our subservicing portfolio would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our intentions to transition our business to be primarily focused on subservicing and portfolio retention further magnifies these risks. For example, our ability to recognize revenues from our portfolio retention business will be dependent upon the size of our subservicing portfolio and the decision by our subservicing clients of whether to engage us to perform such services.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations, inquiries and proceedings, and we may incur fines, penalties, increased costs, and other consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows or damage our reputation.\nThere has been a heightened focus of regulators on the practices of the mortgage industry. Consistent with other mortgage originators and servicers, we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations, examinations, inquiries and proceedings from regulators and attorneys general of certain states as well as various governmental agencies, with respect to our mortgage lending and/or mortgage servicing practices. In addition, we are defendants in various legal proceedings, including private and civil litigation. For more information regarding our existing matters, see Note 15, 'Commitments and Contingencies' in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe are devoting substantial resources towards responding to litigation and regulatory investigations, examinations, inquiries and proceedings and have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, increasing costs with respect to these efforts. Our legal and regulatory matters are at varying procedural stages and the ultimate resolution of any of these matters may result in: (i) adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions and other relief against us, including, without limitation, payments made in settlement arrangements, monetary payments; (ii) enhanced compliance requirements; (iii) changes in our business processes, procedures or agreements; (iv) limitations on our ability to pursue business strategies; or (iv) other agreements and obligations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.\nOur business is complex and heavily regulated, and the full impact of regulatory developments to our business remains uncertain. Any failure of ours to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations or the terms of agreements with regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local government authorities and may be subject to various judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions on how we conduct our business. These laws,\nregulations and judicial and administrative decisions include those pertaining to: real estate settlement procedures; fair lending; fair credit reporting; truth in lending; compliance with federal and state disclosure and licensing requirements; the establishment of maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges; secured transactions; collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims-handling procedures; other trade practices; and privacy regulations providing for the use and safeguarding of non-public personal financial information of borrowers and guidance on non-traditional mortgage loans issued by the federal financial regulatory agencies. In addition, as an outcome of agreements or orders reached with government regulators, we have been, and may be further subject to enhanced compliance monitoring, reporting requirements, changes to our business processes and procedures, and other agreements or obligations related to our origination and servicing activities. Further, by agreement with our private label clients, we are required to comply with additional laws and regulations to which our clients may be subject. While we are not a bank, our private label business subjects us to both direct and indirect banking supervision (including examinations by our private label clients' regulators), and each private label client requires a unique compliance model, which creates complexities and potential inefficiencies in our operations.\nIn recent years, there have been a number of developments in laws and regulations and other financial reform legislation that have negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, our business and increase our risks of investigations, inquiries and proceedings. These developments include but are not limited to: (i) regulations from the Dodd-Frank Act; (ii) proposed changes to the infrastructures of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; (iii) increased vendor oversight obligations placed upon many of our private label clients by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; and (iv) current rules proposed and adopted by the CFPB, including the implementation of changes to mortgage origination and settlement forms under the TILA-RESPA Integrated Mortgage Disclosure Rule, or TRID, which have required significant modifications and enhancements to our mortgage production processes and systems. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and of pending legislation in the U.S. Congress may impact the operation and practices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These changes could reduce or eliminate the government-sponsored entities\u2019 (\"GSEs\") ability to issue mortgage-backed securities, which would materially and adversely affect our business and could require us to fundamentally change our business model since we sold 52% of our loans in 2016 pursuant to GSE-sponsored programs.\nWe expect the higher legislative and regulatory focus on mortgage origination and servicing practices to continue to result in higher legal, compliance and servicing-related costs, heightened risk for potential regulatory fines, penalties, and actions required for injunctive relief, and such developments may result in limitations on our ability to pursue business strategies or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we conduct our business. Regulatory investigations, inquiries and proceedings all require a significant amount of our time and resources to manage. The magnitude and complexity of our responses required to meet these demands requires the time and attention of our management, which poses a risk to achieving our business goals and priorities. Further, in our mortgage origination and servicing activities, we are exposed to operational risk and events of non-compliance resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors, or external events. While we maintain and update our systems and procedures to comply with applicable laws and regulations and devote resources towards managing, assessing and reacting to developments, there can be no assurances that these measures will be effective or that changes will be implemented by the required deadlines.\nOur failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations or the terms of agreements with regulators could result in:\n\u2022\nloss of our approvals to engage in our origination and servicing businesses and/or other limitations on our ability to originate or service loans;\n\u2022\ngovernment investigations and enforcement actions;\n\u2022\nlitigation;\n\u2022\nan inability to execute on our business strategy;\n\u2022\nrequired payments of fines, penalties, settlements or judgments; and/or\n\u2022\ninability to fund our business, or otherwise operate our business.\nAny of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are highly dependent upon programs administered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae.\nOur ability to generate revenues in our Mortgage Production and Servicing segments is highly dependent on programs administered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae that facilitate the issuance of mortgage-backed securities in the secondary market. These entities play a powerful role in the residential mortgage industry, and we have significant business relationships with them, including:\nProduction. During 2016, 52% of our mortgage loan sales were sold to, or were sold pursuant to programs sponsored by, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. We also derive other material financial benefits from our relationships with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, which include the assumption of credit risk by these entities on loans included in mortgage-backed securities in exchange for our payment of guarantee fees, the ability to avoid certain loan inventory finance costs through streamlined loan funding and sale procedures and the use of mortgage warehouse facilities with Fannie Mae, pursuant to which, as of December 31, 2016, we had total capacity of $2 billion, with $150 million committed and $1.85 billion uncommitted.\nServicing. We service loans on behalf of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as loans that have been securitized pursuant to securitization programs sponsored by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. As of December 31, 2016, 59% of our mortgage servicing rights and loans serviced through subservicing agreements pertain to these programs. These entities establish the base service fee to compensate us for servicing loans as well as the assessment of fines and penalties that may be imposed upon us for failing to meet servicing standards.\nOur status as a Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae approved seller/servicer is subject to compliance with each entity\u2019s respective selling and servicing guidelines and failure to meet such guidelines could result in the unilateral termination of our status as an approved seller/servicer. Failure to maintain our relationship with each of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae would result in the termination of many of our agreements with our private label and subservicing clients and otherwise would materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, changes in existing U.S. government-sponsored mortgage programs or servicing eligibility standards could require us to fundamentally change our business model in order to effectively compete in the market. Congress has held hearings and received reports outlining the long-term strategic plan for, and various options for long-term reform of the U.S. housing finance market, including changes designed to reduce government support for housing finance and the winding down of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae over a period of years. If enacted, this legislation or further regulation that curtails Freddie Mac and/or Fannie Mae\u2019s activities and/or results in the wind down of these entities could impact the pricing of mortgage related assets in the secondary market, result in higher mortgage rates to borrowers, and have a resulting negative impact on mortgage origination volumes and margins across the mortgage industry, any one of which could have a negative impact on our business. There is currently uncertainty with respect to the extent, if any, of such reform, and the long-term or short-term impacts of such changes on the housing market, and the related impacts on our operations. There can be no assurances whether we could timely and effectively change our business model in order to remain a competitive mortgage loan originator or servicer, and any such changes to the programs or GSEs may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur mortgage asset-backed debt arrangements, a significant portion of which are short-term agreements, are an important source of our liquidity. If any of our funding arrangements are terminated, not renewed or otherwise become unavailable to us, we may be unable to find replacement financing on economically viable terms, if at all. If a substantial portion of such arrangements are terminated, not renewed, and cannot be replaced, it would adversely affect our ability to fund our operations.\nOur mortgage asset-backed debt arrangements are an important source of liquidity for our origination and servicing activities.\nOur mortgage warehouse facilities typically have up to a 364-day term and certain facilities require us to maintain a specified amount of available funding from other facilities. As such, our liquidity profile and compliance with debt covenants depends on our ability to renew multiple facilities within a short time frame. As of December 31, 2016, each of our mortgage warehouse facilities mature and are subject to renewal on or around March 31, 2017.\nWe are currently expecting significant changes to our business profile, liquidity and capital structure and funding requirements driven by our intended strategic actions and transitions of our business model, including expected changes in our mortgage origination volumes driven by the sales or exit of certain businesses. As such, our ability to renew our mortgage warehouse facilities may be more limited than our historical experience as lenders continually assess PHH and its subsidiaries as counterparties, or we may be unable to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nFurther, our access to and our ability to renew our existing mortgage warehouse facilities is subject to prevailing market conditions, and could suffer in the event of: (i) the deterioration in the performance of the mortgage loans underlying the warehouse facilities; (ii) our failure to maintain sufficient levels of eligible assets or credit enhancements or comply with other terms of the facilities; (iii) our inability to access the secondary market for mortgage loans; and (iv) termination of our role as servicer of the underlying mortgage assets.\nOur servicing advance funding facility, PHH Servicer Advance Receivables Trust (\u201cPSART\u201d), is a special purpose bankruptcy remote trust formed for purposes of issuing non-recourse asset-backed notes secured by servicing advance receivables. Our ability to maintain liquidity through issuing asset-backed notes secured by servicing advance receivables is dependent on many factors, including but not limited to: (i) market demand for ABS, specifically ABS collateralized by mortgage servicing-related receivables; (ii) our ability to service in accordance with applicable guidelines and the quality of our servicing, both of which will impact noteholders\u2019 willingness to commit to financing for an additional term; and (iii) our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to us.\nIf a substantial portion of the committed capacity of our facilities are terminated or are not renewed, we may be unable to find replacement financing on commercially favorable terms, if at all, which could adversely impact our operations and prevent us from executing our business plan, originating new mortgage loans or fulfilling commitments made in the ordinary course of business, and realizing the expected proceeds anticipated from the PHH Home Loans transaction. These factors could reduce revenues attributable to our business activities or require us to sell assets at below market prices, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our overall business and consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our debt arrangements require us to comply with specific financial covenants and other affirmative and restrictive covenants, termination events, conditions precedent to borrowing, and other restrictions, including, but not limited to, those relating to material adverse changes, our consolidated net worth, liquidity, and restrictions on our indebtedness. An uncured default of one or more of these covenants could result in a cross-default between and amongst our asset-backed debt arrangements. Consequently, an uncured default that is not waived by our lenders and that results in an acceleration of amounts payable to our lenders or the termination of credit facilities would materially and adversely impact our liquidity, could force us to sell assets at below market prices to repay our indebtedness, and could force us to seek relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In addition, certain of our mortgage warehouse arrangements contain conditions precedent to borrowing under which our adjusted net income (excluding certain changes in value of mortgage servicing rights and related derivatives and excluding certain expenses) must be $1.00 or more for a rolling 12-month period. Our inability to satisfy this condition would not result in an event of default but would relieve the lender of its funding commitment, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations.\nWe may be limited in our ability to obtain or renew financing in the unsecured credit markets on economically viable terms or at all, due to our senior unsecured long-term debt ratings being below investment grade and due to our history of reported losses from continuing operations since becoming a standalone mortgage company.\nOur senior unsecured long-term debt ratings are below investment grade and, as a result, our access to the public debt markets may be severely limited in comparison to the ability of investment grade issuers to access such markets. In addition, as a result of the uncertainties around our current strategic actions and future business, our access to the credit markets may be more limited than our historical experience, or we may be unable to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIn order to obtain financing in the future, we may be required to rely on alternative financing, such as bank lines and private debt placements, and may also be required to pledge otherwise unencumbered assets. Furthermore, our cost of financing could rise significantly, thereby negatively impacting our financial results. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to further ratings actions: (i) if our business and financial results deteriorate significantly or do not show improvement over an acceptable period of time; (ii) if we are unable to put in place sources of liquidity to fund our business satisfactory to the rating agencies; and/or (iii) based upon regulatory reviews, investigations, proceedings or other claims and enforcement actions that result in material monetary exposures and/or other negative consequences, among other factors. We cannot predict the impact any further negative debt ratings actions may have on our cost of capital, on our ability to incur new indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness or on our ability to retain or secure customers.\nOur hedging strategies related to our mortgage pipeline may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with changes in interest rates. Further, our hedging counterparties may be unwilling to trade with us on substantially similar terms to our historical trades pending the completion of our strategic actions.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk and related price risk for our origination pipeline and related assets, including interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held for sale. Interest rate lock commitments generally range between 30 and 90 days, and we typically sell mortgage loans within 30 days of origination. Our pipeline hedging activities include entering into derivative instruments, such as forward delivery commitments on mortgage backed-securities or whole loans, futures, and option contracts, to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks.\nHowever, no hedging strategy can protect us completely. The nature and timing of hedging transactions influence the effectiveness of these strategies. Our hedging strategies also rely on assumptions and projections regarding our assets and general market factors. If these assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes including, but not limited to, interest rates, we may incur losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, changes in interest rates may require us to post additional collateral under certain of our financing arrangements and derivative agreements which could impact our liquidity. Due to the expected significant changes to our business profile, liquidity and capital structure driven by our intended strategic actions and transition of our business model, our liquidity and ability to trade may be more limited than our historical experience, as hedging participants may be unwilling to trade or execute loan sales with us on substantially similar terms to our historical experience.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nA change in control transaction may result in a number of significant cash outflows that could reduce the value of our business. Further, the provisions of certain of our agreements could discourage third parties from seeking to acquire us, or could prevent or delay a transaction resulting in a change of control.\nThe net proceeds realized by our shareholders as the result of any change in control transaction or a fundamental change to our businesses, may be negatively impacted as a result of required payments under our unsecured debt, certain tax impacts or the potential termination of certain client relationships (if consents or waivers are not obtained), among other consequences.\nThe terms of certain of our Senior note agreements and indentures contain provisions that require us to offer to repurchase, for cash, all or a portion of the outstanding notes upon a change of control, as defined in such indentures. Further, a change of control may constitute an event of default under certain of our debt agreements, including our mortgage warehouse facilities.\nWe may need to obtain consents or waivers from the GSEs, state licensing agencies and certain clients or counterparties, in connection with certain change in control transactions. Additionally, the value of our business could be reduced from any lost relationships and/or loss of our approved status as a Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae approved seller/servicer in connection with certain change in control transactions. Our agreements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac require us to provide notice or obtain approvals or consents related to any change in control transaction. Our agreements with Realogy, including the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement, state that Realogy may terminate PHH Home Loans if we effect a change in control transaction involving certain competitors or other third parties. In connection with such termination, we may be required to make a cash payment to Realogy in an amount equal to PHH Home Loans\u2019 trailing 12 months net income multiplied by two.\nIn addition, agreements with some of our financial institution clients governing our private label relationships provide our clients with the right to terminate their relationship with us if we complete certain change in control transactions with certain third parties. The need to obtain waivers or consents from our clients in connection with a change in control transaction may discourage certain third parties from seeking to acquire us or could reduce or delay our receipt of the amount of consideration they would be willing to pay to our stockholders in an acquisition transaction, or could otherwise reduce the value of the business when separated.\nProvisions in our charter documents, the Maryland General Corporation Law, and New York insurance law may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party.\nOur charter and by-laws contain several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions include, among other things, advance notice for raising business or making nominations at meetings and \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. Blank check preferred stock enables our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to designate and issue additional series of preferred stock with such dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, including the right to issue convertible securities with no limitations on conversion, as our Board of Directors may determine, including rights to dividends and proceeds in a liquidation that are senior to the Common stock.\nWe are also subject to certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law which could delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their Common stock or may otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. These include, among other provisions:\n\u2022\nthe \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d statute which prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder and\n\u2022\nthe \u201ccontrol share\u201d acquisition statute which provides that control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.\nOur by-laws contain a provision exempting any share of our capital stock from the control share acquisition statute to the fullest extent permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law. However, our Board of Directors has the exclusive right to amend our by-laws and, subject to their fiduciary duties, could at any time in the future amend the by-laws to remove this exemption provision.\nIn addition, we are registered as an insurance holding company in the state of New York as a result of our wholly owned subsidiary, Atrium Insurance Corporation. New York insurance law requires regulatory approval of a change in control of an insurer or an insurer\u2019s holding company. Accordingly, there can be no effective change in control of us unless the person seeking to acquire control has filed a statement containing specified information with the New York state insurance regulators and has obtained prior approval. The measure for a presumptive change of control pursuant to New York law is the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting stock or other ownership interest of an insurance company or its parent. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of us, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable.\nOther Risks\nOur financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates made by our management, including those used in determining the fair values of a substantial portion of our assets. If the assumptions or estimates are subsequently proven incorrect or inaccurate, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nPursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we utilize certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including but not limited to, when determining the fair values of certain assets and liabilities, accruals related to litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, and reserves related to mortgage representations and warranty claims. If the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience significant losses as the ultimate realization of value may be materially different than the amounts reflected in our consolidated statement of financial position as of any particular date.\nFor additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing our financial statements, see \u201cPart II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nFair Value. A substantial portion of our assets are recorded at fair value based upon significant estimates and assumptions with changes in fair value included in our consolidated results of operations. As of December 31, 2016, 44% of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including $690 million of assets representing our Mortgage servicing rights, which are valued using significant unobservable inputs and management\u2019s judgment of the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset. Further, we utilize fair value measurements in our review of the carrying value of long-lived assets and investments for impairment. The determination of the fair value of our assets involves numerous estimates and assumptions made by our management. Such estimates and assumptions include, without limitation, estimates of future cash flows associated with our Mortgage servicing rights based upon model inputs involving interest rates as well as the prepayment rates and delinquencies and foreclosure rates of the underlying serviced mortgage loans. The use of different estimates or assumptions in connection with the valuation of these assets could produce materially different fair values, or our fair value estimates may not be realized in an actual sale or settlement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nLegal and Regulatory Contingencies. Accruals are established for pending or threatened litigation, claims or assessments when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. In light of the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation and other legal proceedings, it is not always possible to determine a reasonable estimate of the amount of a probable loss, and we may estimate a range of possible loss for consideration in these estimates. The estimates are based upon currently available information and involve significant judgment taking into account the varying stages and inherent uncertainties of such matters. Accordingly, our estimates may change from time to time and such changes may be material to our consolidated results of operations. There can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of such matters will not result in losses in excess of our recorded accruals, or in excess of our estimate of reasonably possible losses, and the ultimate settlement of such matters may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRepresentations and Warranties. In connection with the sale of mortgage loans, we make various representations and warranties that, if breached, require us to repurchase the loans or indemnify the purchaser for actual losses incurred in respect of such loans. The estimation of our loan repurchase and indemnification liability requires subjective and complex judgments, and incorporates key assumptions that are impacted by both internal and external factors. Internal factors include, but are not limited to, the level of loan sales and origination volumes, and the quality of our underwriting procedures. External factors include, but are not limited to: (i) the political environment and oversight of the Agencies, and related changes in Agency programs and guidelines; (ii) borrower delinquency levels and default patterns; (iii) home price values and (iv) the overall economic condition of borrowers and the U.S. economy. There can be no assurance that we will not realize losses in excess of our recorded reserves, or in excess of our estimate of reasonably possible losses, and that such losses may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur reliance on outsourcing arrangements for information technology services subjects us to significant business process and control risks due to the complexity of our information systems or if our outsourcing counterparties do not meet their obligations to us.\nWe outsource certain information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) services to a third party which subjects us to significant business process and control risks. If our outsource partner fails to perform their obligations under the terms of the agreement, or if our management of this vendor is not successful, we are subject to operational risk from our IT environment. We are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems which we use to interface with our customers, to maintain compliance with applicable regulations and to manage our internal financial and other systems. Our business model and our reputation as a service provider to our clients, as well as our internal controls over financial reporting, are highly dependent upon these systems and processes. In addition, our ability to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations is dependent on our technology infrastructure.\nAlthough we have service-level arrangements with our counterparties, we do not ultimately control their performance, which may make our operations vulnerable to their performance failures. Any failures in our technology systems, processes or the related internal and operational controls, or the failure of our outsourcing providers to perform as expected or as contractually required could result in the loss of client relationships, damage to our reputation, failures to comply with regulations, failure to prepare our financial statements in a timely and accurate manner, and increased costs, the result of any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nDuring 2016, we elected to terminate certain IT outsourcing agreements, and we intend to transition such services from the third party to our own systems and processes by the first quarter of 2018. We face risks related to our ability to successfully transition the performance of these processes and the related internal and operational controls, and in enhancing our internal processes to support the functions previously outsourced. We may incur costs in connection with this transition that we may not have incurred, other than for our decision to end this outsourcing relationship.\nA failure in or breach of our technology infrastructure or information protection programs, or those of our outsource providers, could result in the inadvertent disclosure of the confidential personal information of our customers, as well as the confidential personal information of the customers of our clients. Any such failure or breach, including as a result of cyber-attacks against us or our outsource partners, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nOur business model and our reputation as a service provider to our clients are dependent upon our ability to safeguard the confidential personal information of our customers, as well as the confidential personal information of the customers of our clients. Although we have put in place, and require our outsource providers to follow, a comprehensive information security program that we monitor and update as needed, security breaches could occur through intentional or unintentional acts by individuals having authorized or unauthorized access to confidential information of our customers or the employees or customers of our clients which could\npotentially compromise confidential information processed and stored in or transmitted through our technology infrastructure. In addition, we have highly complex information systems, certain portions of which we are dependent upon third party outsource providers and other portions of which are self-developed and for which third party support is not generally available.\nA failure in or breach of the security of our information systems, or those of our outsource providers, or a cyber-attack against us or our outsource partners, could result in significant damage to our reputation or the reputation of our clients, could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain clients and could result in increased costs attributable to related litigation or regulatory actions, claims for indemnification, higher insurance premiums and remediation activities, the result of any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.", "PERMNO": 90531, "SIC": 6162, "TIC": "PHH"}
