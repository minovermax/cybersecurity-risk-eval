{"cik": "913277", "company": "Clarus Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-07", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business, because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those mentioned in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition, and the price of our common stock, could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nMany of the products we sell are used for inherently risky outdoor pursuits and could give rise to product liability or product warranty claims and other loss contingencies, which could affect our earnings and financial condition.\nMany of our products are used in applications and situations that involve high levels of risk of personal injury and death. As a result, we maintain a staff who focus on the appropriate disclaimers and markings and testing and seek to assure the quality and safety of our products. We stay current with the law to seek to provide thorough and protective disclaimers and instructions on all of our products and packaging. Furthermore, our technical climbing and avalanche safety equipment and our related operations meet and are certified to International Personal Protective Equipment (PP) standards set by the EEC or ISO 9001 quality system standards. Failure to use our products for their intended purposes, failure to use or care for them properly, or their malfunction, or, in some limited circumstances, even correct use of our products, could result in serious bodily injury or death.\nWe remain exposed to product liability claims by the nature of the products we produce. Exposure occurs if one of our products is alleged to have resulted in property damage, bodily injury or other adverse effects. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product or activities associated with the product, negligence, strict liability, and a breach of warranties. Although we maintain product liability insurance in amounts that we believe are reasonable, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, in the future or that product liability claims will not exceed the amount of insurance coverage. Additionally, we do not maintain product recall insurance. As a result, product recalls or product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of consumer products, we are subject to government regulation in the United States and other countries, including, without limitation, the Consumer Products Safety Act, which empowers the Consumer Products Safety Commission to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous. Under certain circumstances, the Consumer Products Safety Commission could require us to repurchase or recall one or more of our products. Additionally, laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some cities and states, as well as in other countries in which we sell our products, and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future. Any repurchase or recall of our products could be costly to us and could damage our reputation. If we were required to remove, or we voluntarily removed, our products from the market, our reputation could be tarnished and we might have large quantities of finished products that we could not sell.\nWe spend substantial resources ensuring compliance with governmental and other applicable standards. However, compliance with these standards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits, which can entail significant cost and risk. We do not maintain insurance against many types of claims involving alleged defects in our products that do not involve personal injury or property damage. As a result, these types of claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur product liability insurance program is an occurrence-based program based on our current and historical claims experience and the availability and cost of insurance. We carry both general and umbrella liability policies that insure us for product liability claims. The policy has a small retention, which enables us to manage and control our product liability claims. Historically, product liability awards have not exceeded our individual per occurrence self-insured retention. We cannot assure you, however, that our future product liability experience will be consistent with our past experience.\nWe are subject to risks related to our dependence on the strength of retail economies in various parts of the world and our performance may be affected by general economic conditions.\nOur business depends on the strength of the retail economies in various parts of the world, primarily in North America, Europe, Australia and to a lesser extent, Asia, Central and South America. These retail economies are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry, which, in turn, are affected by general economic conditions and specific events such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and political unrest. The impact of these external factors is difficult to predict, and one or more of the factors could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nPurchases of many consumer products are discretionary and tend to be highly correlated with the cycles of the levels of disposable income of consumers. As a result, any substantial deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect consumer discretionary spending patterns, our sales, and our results of operations. In particular, decreased consumer confidence or a reduction in discretionary income as a result of unfavorable macroeconomic conditions may negatively affect our business. If the macroeconomic environment worsens, consumers may reduce or delay their purchases of our products. Any such reduction in purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in the retail industry and markets for consumer products affecting our customers or retailing practices could negatively impact existing customer relationships and our results of operations.\nWe sell our products to retailers, including sporting goods and specialty retailers, as well as direct to consumers. A significant deterioration in the financial condition of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. We regularly monitor and evaluate the credit status of our customers and attempt to adjust sales terms as appropriate. Despite these efforts, a bankruptcy filing by a key customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, as a result of the desire of retailers to more closely manage inventory levels, there is a growing trend among retailers to make purchases on a \u201cjust-in-time\u201d basis. This requires us to shorten our lead time for production in certain cases and more closely anticipate demand, which could in the future require us to carry additional inventories.\nWe may be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retailer customers, such as inventory destocking, limitations on access to and time on shelf space, use of private label brands, price demands, payment terms, and other conditions, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nThere is a growing trend among retailers in the U.S. and in foreign markets to undergo changes such as consolidations, restructurings or store closings or reorganizations, that could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the concentration of ownership within the retail industry. These changes within the retail industry could result in a shift of bargaining power to the retail industry and in fewer outlets for our products which could result in price and other competition that could reduce our margins and our net sales.\nSeasonality and weather conditions may cause our operating results to vary from quarter to quarter.\nSales of certain of our products in our Outdoor segment are seasonal. Sales of our outdoor recreation products such as carabineers, harnesses, and related climbing equipment products increase during warm weather months and decrease during winter, while sales of our apparel line and winter sports equipment such as our skis and related ski equipment increase during the cold weather months and decrease during summer. Weather conditions may also negatively impact sales. For instance, milder temperatures could prevent the formation of ice, which may negatively affect demand for our ice climbing products, and mild winter weather with less snowfall may negatively impact sales of our winter sports products. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products.\nWe often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers before our customers\u2019 orders are firm. Therefore, if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers.\nInventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. On the other hand, if we underestimate demand for our products, our manufacturing facilities or third-party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues, as well as damage to our reputation and customer relationships. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage inventory levels to exactly meet future order and reorder requirements.\nCompetition in our industries may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy, achieve profitability, or maintain relationships with existing customers.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. In this industry, we compete against numerous other domestic and foreign companies. Competition in the markets in which we operate is based primarily on product quality, product innovation, price, and customer service and support, although the degree and nature of such competition vary by location and product line. Some of our competitors are more established in their industries and have substantially greater revenue or resources than we do. Our competitors may take actions to match new product introductions and other initiatives. Since many of our competitors also source their products from third parties, our ability to obtain a cost advantage through sourcing is reduced. Certain of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower profit margins to compete with us. Further, retailers often demand that suppliers reduce their prices on existing products. Competition could cause price reductions, reduced profits or losses or loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nTo compete effectively in the future in the consumer products industry, among other things, we must: maintain strict quality standards; develop new and innovative products that appeal to consumers; deliver products on a reliable basis at competitive prices; anticipate and respond to changing consumer trends in a timely manner; maintain favorable brand recognition; and provide effective marketing support.\nOur inability to do any of these things could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and market products similar to ours, which could adversely affect our market share and results of operations.\nOur success with our proprietary products depends, in part, on our ability to protect our current and future technologies and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and market products similar to ours. Our principal intellectual property rights include our trademarks, patents, and trade secrets.\nWe hold numerous patents for the invention of new or improved technologies, which are known as utility patents, and pending patent applications covering a wide variety of products. We cannot be sure that we will receive patents for any of our patent applications or that any existing or future patents that we receive or license will provide competitive advantages for our products. We also cannot be sure that competitors will not challenge, invalidate or avoid the application of any existing or future patents that we receive or license. In addition, patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing, using or selling products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products.\nThird parties may have patents, or may be awarded new patents, that may materially adversely affect our ability to market, distribute and sell our products. Accordingly, our products, including, but not limited to, our technical climbing and backpack products, may become subject to patent infringement claims or litigation, any adverse determination of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur operations in international markets, and earnings in those markets, may be affected by changes in global cultural, political, and financial market conditions as well as potential changes in regulations, legislation and government policies.\nApproximately 45% of our sales on a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2021 were earned in international markets. As such our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new international markets is subject to risks associated with international operations. These include the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, new tariffs or other barriers to some international markets. For example, any future withdrawal or renegotiation of trade agreements, and the prosecution of trade disputes or the imposition of tariffs, duties, taxes and other charges on imports or exports between the United States and countries like China may adversely affect our ability to operate our business and execute our growth strategy. In addition, it may be more difficult for us to enforce agreements, collect receivables, receive dividends and repatriate earnings through foreign legal systems.\nWe cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, exchange controls, current or future \u201ctrade wars\u201d or other restrictions will be imposed by the United States, Australia, China, or other countries upon the import or export of our products and the commodities and components used to manufacture our products, or what effect any of these actions would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot predict whether there might be changes in our ability to repatriate earnings or capital from international jurisdictions. Changes in regulatory and geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect our business or may require us to modify our current business practices.\nSome of our operations are conducted or products are sold in countries where economic growth has slowed, or where economies have suffered economic, social and/or political instability or hyperinflation. In addition, global economic uncertainty relating to the effects of fiscal and political crises and political and economic disputes, changes in consumer spending, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, political unrest, natural disasters or other crises, terrorist acts, acts of war and/or military operations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we cannot continue to develop new products in a timely manner, and at favorable margins, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe believe that our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to continue to introduce innovative design extensions for our existing products and to develop, manufacture, and market new products. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in the introduction, manufacturing, and marketing of any new products or product innovations, or develop and introduce, in a timely manner, innovations to our existing products that satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance. Our failure to develop new products and introduce them successfully and in a timely manner, and at favorable margins, would harm our ability to successfully grow our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur operating results can be adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials.\nPricing and availability of raw materials for use in our businesses can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control, including general, domestic, and international economic conditions, labor costs, production levels, competition, consumer demand, import duties, and tariffs and currency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of raw materials for us, and may therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDuring periods of rising prices of raw materials, there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass any portion of such increases on to customers. Conversely, when raw material prices decline, customer demands for lower prices could result in lower sale prices and, to the extent we have existing inventory, lower margins. We currently do not hedge against our exposure to changing raw material prices. As a result, fluctuations in raw material prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nSupply shortages or changes in availability for any particular type of raw material can delay production or cause increases in the cost of manufacturing our products. We may be negatively affected by changes in availability and pricing of raw materials, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nChanges in effective tax rates could adversely affect our results.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) was enacted. The Tax Act significantly revised United States corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the corporate income tax rate to 21%. Prior to the 2020 U.S. election, President Biden proposed an increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%, doubling the rate of tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the creation of a 10% penalty on certain imports and a 15% minimum tax on worldwide book income. If any or all of these (or similar) proposals are ultimately enacted into law, in whole or in part, they could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock may be negatively impacted by the effects of a disease outbreak, epidemic, pandemic, or similar widespread public health concern, such as travel restrictions or recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to avoid large gatherings or to self-quarantine, whether as a result of the COVID-19 or coronavirus global pandemic or otherwise.\nThese impacts include, but are not limited to:\n\uf0b7Significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products;\n\uf0b7Disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements;\n\uf0b7Failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, customers, retailers or other service providers to meet their obligations to the Company;\n\uf0b7Significant changes in the political conditions in the markets in which we operate and/or manufacture, sell or distribute our products; or\n\uf0b7Our ability to maintain adequate liquidity and/or meet debt covenants contained in the Company\u2019s credit agreement if the Company is unable to resume normal operations in a timely fashion.\nOur failure to effectively manage and remedy these impacts on the Company, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock.\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in ongoing disruptions and delays in manufacturing, shipping and transportation of our products that has had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we expect this adverse impact to continue.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also has the potential to significantly impact our supply chain if the factories that manufacture our products, the distribution centers where we manage our inventory, or the operations of our suppliers of raw materials or other finished product components, logistics and other service providers are disrupted, temporarily closed or experience worker shortages. Current vessel, container and other transportation shortages, labor shortages and port congestion globally have delayed and are expected to continue to delay inventory orders and, in turn, deliveries to our customers and availability in our company-operated stores and e-commerce sites. These supply chain and logistics disruptions have impacted our inventory levels and net revenues in 2021 and could impact our sales volumes in future periods. We have also incurred in 2021, higher freight and other distribution costs, including air freight, to mitigate these delays. We are also seeing negative impacts to pricing of certain components of our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event we increase prices of our products, there can be no assurance that consumers will accept such increases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock.\nWe use foreign suppliers and manufacturing facilities for a significant portion of our raw materials and finished products, and disruptions to international trade, such as disease epidemics or potential \u2018trade wars,\u2019 pose a risk to our business operations.\nA majority of our products sold were produced by and purchased from independent manufacturers primarily located in Asia and Eastern Europe, with substantially all of the remainder produced by our manufacturing facilities located in Utah and Missouri. Although no single supplier and no one country controls a majority of our production needs, any of the following could materially and adversely affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations:\n\uf0b7political or labor instability in countries where our facilities, contractors, and suppliers are located;\n\uf0b7political or military conflict, which could cause a delay in the transportation of raw materials and products to us and an increase in transportation costs;\n\uf0b7heightened terrorism security concerns;\n\uf0b7disease epidemics and health-related concerns, such as COVID-19 or the coronavirus;\n\uf0b7imposition of regulations and quotas relating to imports and our ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations;\n\uf0b7imposition of tariffs, duties, taxes and other charges on imports and/or exports; and\n\uf0b7imposition or the repeal of laws that affect intellectual property rights.\nChanges in governmental regulation, legislation or public opinion regarding the manufacture and sale of bullets, or the possession and use of firearms and ammunition, could adversely affect our Precision Sport segment and overall financial results.\nThe manufacture and sale of bullets by our Precision Sport segment, and the possession and use of firearms and ammunition by our customers, is subject to significant governmental regulation. We hold all licenses necessary for the legal manufacture and sale of our bullets. However, federal, state or local legislatures may enact further legislation regarding the manufacture and sale of bullets, and the possession and use of firearms and ammunition by our customers, such as point-of-sale background checks, age and other restrictions on ammunition purchases or further licensing of ammunition dealers. Such legislation, if enacted, could materially and adversely affect the sale of bullets that we manufacture.\nThe manufacture and sale of bullets, and the possession and use of firearms and ammunition, is also the subject of significant public interest and debate. If public opinion should worsen, it may lead to boycotts of certain of our products and decreased demand for the bullets and other products we manufacture by consumers and the other constituencies with which we deal, including suppliers, distributors and retailers, all of which could be a catalyst for potentially adverse reactions from our shareholders.\nWe cannot assure you that governmental regulation, legislation or public opinion regarding the manufacture and sale of bullets, or the possession and use of firearms and ammunition, will not become more restrictive or worsen in the future. We also cannot assure you that any such negative public opinion relating to our Precision Sport segment would not affect our Black Diamond or Adventure segments, nor can we assure you that any such changes in governmental regulation, legislation or public opinion will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. See \u201cBusiness\u2009-\u2009Regulatory Matters.\u201d\nWe may incur significant costs in order to comply with environmental remediation obligations.\nEnvironmental laws in the United States and in other countries also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation, often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination. Accordingly, we may be liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for remediation costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by us, is a landfill or other location where we have disposed wastes, or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property. Given the nature of the past industrial operations conducted by us and others at these properties, there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil or groundwater contamination have been identified, even for those properties where an environmental site assessment has been conducted. Future events, such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown contamination, may give rise to additional remediation liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Business\nThere are significant risks associated with acquiring and integrating businesses.\nAn element of our general growth strategy is the acquisition of or investment in businesses and assets that will diversify our current business, increase size, expand our geographic scope of operations and otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may not be able to successfully identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities, obtain financing for acquisitions, make acquisitions on satisfactory terms, or successfully acquire and/or integrate identified targets. In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business or assets for a potential acquisition or investment, we expect to encounter intense competition from other entities, including blank check companies, private equity groups, venture capital funds, leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well-established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or\nthrough affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us which will give them a competitive advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses.\nOur ability to implement our acquisition strategy is also subject to other risks and costs, including:\n\uf0b7loss of key employees, customers or suppliers of acquired businesses;\n\uf0b7diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from our core businesses;\n\uf0b7adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\uf0b7our ability to secure necessary financing;\n\uf0b7our ability to realize operating efficiencies, synergies, or other benefits expected from an acquisition;\n\uf0b7risks associated with entering markets in which we have limited or no experience;\n\uf0b7risks associated with our ability to execute successful due diligence; and\n\uf0b7assumption of contingent or undisclosed liabilities of acquisition targets.\nAny of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur previously announced growth strategy may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company announced that it is seeking to invest in high-quality, durable, cash flow-producing assets in order to diversify our business within the outdoor and consumer markets and potentially monetize our substantial net operating losses as part of our previously announced growth strategy. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of the growth strategy, that any particular acquisition or investment opportunities will be consummated, that any transaction will occur, or that our net operating losses will be monetized. In addition, our growth strategy may create perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and may result in the loss of employees, customers or business partners. Turmoil across various sectors of the financial markets may negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and/or operating results as well as our ability to effectively execute our growth strategy.\nVarious sectors of the credit markets and the financial services industry have experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by disruption in the credit markets and availability of credit and other financing, the failure, bankruptcy, collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States federal government. While the future recurrence of these events cannot be predicted, they may have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain financing necessary to effectively execute acquisitions, the ability of our customers and suppliers to continue to operate their businesses or the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to adequately manage our growth.\nWe have expanded, and are seeking to continue to expand, our business. This growth has placed significant demands on our management, administrative, operating, and financial resources as well as our manufacturing capacity capabilities. The continued growth of our customer base, the types of products offered and the geographic markets served can be expected to continue to place a significant strain on our resources. Personnel qualified in the production and marketing of our products are difficult to find and hire, and enhancements of information technology systems to support growth are difficult to implement. Our future performance and profitability will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional management and other key personnel, as well as our ability to increase and maintain our manufacturing capacity capabilities to meet the needs of our current and future customers. Any failure to adequately manage our growth could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur credit agreement contains financial and restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to operate our business.\nThe credit agreement that we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. on May 3, 2019 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) contains, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business, including, without limitation, restrictions on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\uf0b7incur additional debt or create liens;\n\uf0b7engage in mergers, consolidations, certain divisions, liquidations or dissolutions other than in certain permitted instances described in the Credit Agreement;\n\uf0b7substantially change the business conducted by us or our subsidiaries; and\n\uf0b7pay dividends or make distributions or other restricted payments if certain conditions in the Credit Agreement are not fulfilled.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to perform the following, subject to certain customary exceptions, qualifications and \u201cbaskets\u201d: make certain\ninvestments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions other than in certain permitted instances as described in the Credit Agreement; sell assets; prepay other indebtedness; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries or the ability of subsidiaries to grant liens upon their assets; amend certain charter documents and material agreements governing subordinated indebtedness; and deviate from certain financial ratios described further in the Credit Agreement.\nAs a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be significantly restricted, and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions or making acquisitions of a business that might otherwise be beneficial to us.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nOur borrowings under our credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows would decrease.\nCompliance with changing laws, regulations and standards of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes Oxley Act\u201d), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, new Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and NASDAQ rules, are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours. These new or changed laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nWe could face particular challenges in maintaining and reporting on our internal control over financial reporting.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal control over financial reporting and requires that we have our internal control over financial reporting audited. If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties and/or stockholder litigation. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm report on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. In addition, acquisition targets may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.\nIf we identify any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, we may need to take costly steps to implement improved controls and may be subject to sanctions for failure to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such remedial costs or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Further, we would be required to disclose any material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, and we would receive an adverse opinion on our internal control over financial reporting from our independent auditors. These factors could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nBreaches of our information systems could adversely affect our reputation, disrupt our operations, and result in increased costs and loss of revenue.\nThere have been an increasing number of recent global cyber security incidents affecting companies, including us. These incidents are expected to be more prevalent as a result of work-from-home policies instituted in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, and could cause operational failures or compromise sensitive or confidential corporate and personal data. Because we are interconnected with and dependent on third-party vendors, we could also be adversely affected if we or any of our vendors are subject to a successful cyber-attack or other information security event. Such cyber security incidents may result in the loss or compromise of customer, financial, or operational data; disruption of billing, collections, or normal operating activities; disruption of electronic monitoring and control of operational systems; and delays in financial reporting and other management functions, and our acquisition activities could increase such risk. There can be no guarantees that such a cyber incident would not result in the unauthorized access to or the disclosure of customer data, our trade secrets or other intellectual property, or personal information of our employees. There can be no guarantee that the disclosure of any of this information would not have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations. We continually evaluate our systems and may implement further controls and additional preventative actions\nto further strengthen our systems against attacks. We cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security, that we will be able to react in a timely manner, or that our remediation efforts following past or future attacks will be successful. Possible impacts associated with a cyber security incident may include, among other things, business interruption, ransom payments, the identification of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, remediation costs related to lost, stolen, or compromised data; repairs to data processing systems; increased cyber security protection costs; reputational damage; and adverse effects on our compliance with privacy and other laws and regulations that are applicable to us. We have insurance coverage to protect us against losses from certain cyber security incidents, including liability for third-party vendors who mishandle our information. However, there can be no guarantee that every potential loss due to cyber-attack or theft of information has been insured against, nor that the limits of the insurance we have acquired will be sufficient to cover all such losses.\nAdverse publicity about the Company and/or its brands, including without limitation, through social media or in connection with brand damaging events and/or public perception could negatively impact our business.\nNegative claims or publicity involving us, our board of directors, our brands, our products, services and experiences, consumer data, or any of our key employees, endorsers, or suppliers could seriously damage our reputation and the image of our brands, regardless of whether such claims are accurate.\nSocial media, which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. Adverse publicity could also damage our reputation and the image of our brands, undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if such adverse publicity is unfounded or not material to our operations. If the reputation, culture or image of any of our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity, then our sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe effects of climate change and increased focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, customers, consumers and investors on sustainability issues, including those related to climate change and socially responsible activities, may adversely affect our business and financial results and damage our reputation.\nClimate change is occurring around the world and may impact our business in numerous ways. Such change could lead to an increase in raw material and packaging prices, reduced availability, for example, due to water shortages which could adversely impact raw material availability. Increased frequency of extreme weather (storms and floods) could cause increased incidence of disruption to the production and distribution of our products and an adverse impact on consumer demand and spending.\nInvestor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants, shareholders, and stakeholders have focused increasingly on the environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) and related sustainability practices of companies. These parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our brands, reputation and employee retention may be negatively impacted. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices. Also, our failure, or perceived failure, to manage reputational threats and meet expectations with respect to socially responsible activities and sustainability commitments could negatively impact our credibility, employee retention, and the willingness of our customers and suppliers to do business with us.\nInterruptions in the proper functioning of our information systems or other issues with our enterprise resource planning systems could cause disruption to our operations.\nWe heavily rely on our information systems to manage our various business operations, including our ordering, pricing, billing, inventory management, supply chain, accounting and other processes. Our systems may be subject to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber security breaches, vandalism, severe weather conditions, catastrophic events, terrorism, and human error. Although we do maintain disaster recovery measures in place which we believe to be adequate, we cannot assure you that our disaster recovery measures can account for all eventualities. If our systems are damaged, fail to function properly, or otherwise become compromised or unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur information technology systems require periodic modifications, upgrades, and replacement that subject us to costs and risks, including potential disruption to our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, additional administration and operating expenses, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel or outside firms to implement and operate existing or new systems, and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new or modified systems or of integrating new or modified systems into our current systems. In addition, challenges implementing new or modified technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business operations if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated.\nOur Board of Directors and executive officers have significant influence over our affairs.\nThe members of our Board of Directors and our executive officers, which includes Mr. Warren B. Kanders, beneficially own approximately 24.2% of our outstanding common stock as of March 2, 2022. As a result, our Board of Directors and executive officer, to the extent they vote their shares in a similar manner, have influence over our affairs and could exercise such influence in a manner that is not in the best interests of our other stockholders, including by attempting to delay, defer or prevent a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nWe may be unable to realize the benefits of our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.\nNet operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) may be carried forward to offset federal and state taxable income in future years and eliminate income taxes otherwise payable on such taxable income, subject to certain adjustments. Based on current federal corporate income tax rates, our NOL and other carryforwards could provide a benefit to us, if fully utilized, of significant future tax savings. However, our ability to use these tax benefits in future years will depend upon the amount of our otherwise taxable income. If we do not have sufficient taxable income in future years to use the tax benefits before they expire, we will lose the benefit of these NOL carryforwards permanently.\nAdditionally, if we underwent an ownership change, the NOL carryforward limitations would impose an annual limit on the amount of the taxable income that may be offset by our NOL generated prior to the ownership change. If an ownership change were to occur, we may be unable to use a significant portion of our NOL to offset taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs when, as of any testing date, the aggregate of the increase in percentage points of the total amount of a corporation\u2019s stock owned by one or more \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cCode\u201d) whose percentage ownership of the stock has increased as of such date over the aggregate of the lowest percentage of the stock owned by such 5-percent shareholder at any time during the three-year period preceding such date is more than 50 percentage points. In general, persons who own 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s stock are 5-percent shareholders, and all stock owned by persons who are not 5-percent shareholders is treated as owned by one 5-percent shareholder. The issuance of a large number of shares of common stock in connection with any acquisitions could result in a limitation of the use of our NOLs.\nFurther, our certificate of incorporation provides for blank check preferred stock, which allows the Board to issue preferred stock at any time with rights and designations set forth by the Board. Section 382 of the Code generally excludes preferred stock when calculating ownership percentages as they relate to our NOLs if the preferred stock satisfies all of the following criteria: it is not entitled to vote, it is limited and preferred as to dividends and does not participate in corporate growth to any significant extent, it has redemption and liquidation rights which do not exceed the issue price of such stock (except for a reasonable redemption or liquidation premium), and it is not convertible into another class of stock. Our Board may authorize and issue preferred stock that does not meet these criteria, and such preferred stock would count towards determining ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Therefore the issuance of any preferred stock could increase the likelihood of a limitation of the use of our NOLs.\nMoreover, if a corporation experiences an ownership change and does not satisfy the continuity of business enterprise, or COBE, requirement (which generally requires that the corporation continue its historic business or use a significant portion of its historic business assets in a business for the two-year period beginning on the date of the ownership change), it cannot, subject to certain exceptions, use any NOL from a pre-change period to offset taxable income in post-change years.\nThe actual ability to utilize the tax benefit of any existing NOLs will be subject to future facts and circumstances with respect to meeting the above described COBE requirements at the time NOLs are being utilized on a tax return. The realization of NOLs and the recognition of asset and valuation allowances for deferred taxes require management to make estimates and judgments about the Company\u2019s future profitability which are inherently uncertain. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. If, in the opinion of management, it becomes more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, deferred tax assets would be reduced by a valuation allowance and any such reduction could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company.\nThe amount of NOL and tax credit carryforwards that we have claimed has not been audited or otherwise validated by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d). The IRS could challenge our calculation of the amount of our NOL or our determinations as to when a prior change in ownership occurred, and other provisions of the Code may limit our ability to carry forward our NOL to offset taxable income in future years. If the IRS were successful with respect to any such challenge, the potential tax benefit of the NOL carryforwards to us could be substantially reduced.\nCertain protective measures implemented by us to preserve our NOL may not be effective or may have some unintended negative effects.\nOn July 24, 2003, at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved an amendment (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to restrict certain acquisitions of our securities in order to help assure the preservation\nof our NOL. The Amendment generally restricts direct and indirect acquisitions of our equity securities if such acquisition will affect the percentage of the Company\u2019s capital stock that is treated as owned by a \u201c5% stockholder.\u201d Additionally, on February 7, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a rights agreement which is designed to assist in limiting the number of 5% or more owners and thus reduce the risk of a possible \u201cchange of ownership\u201d under Section 382 of the Code.\nAlthough the transfer restrictions imposed on our capital stock and the rights agreement are intended to reduce the likelihood of an impermissible ownership change, there is no guarantee that such protective measures would prevent all transfers that would result in an impermissible ownership change. These protective measures also will require any person attempting to acquire a significant interest in us to seek the approval of our Board of Directors. This may have an \u201canti-takeover\u201d effect because our Board of Directors may be able to prevent any future takeover. Similarly, any limits on the amount of capital stock that a stockholder may own could have the effect of making it more difficult for stockholders to replace current management. Additionally, because protective measures implemented by us to preserve our NOL will have the effect of restricting a stockholder\u2019s ability to acquire our common stock, the liquidity and market value of our common stock might suffer.\nThe loss of any member of our senior management or certain other key executives could significantly harm our business.\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position is dependent to a large degree on the efforts and skills of our senior management team, including Warren B. Kanders. If we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management, our business may be significantly impaired. In addition, many of our senior executives have strong industry reputations, which aid us in identifying acquisition and borrowing opportunities, and having such opportunities brought to us. The loss of the services of these key personnel could materially and adversely affect our operations because of diminished relationships with lenders, existing and prospective tenants, property sellers and industry personnel.\nOur Board of Directors may change significant corporate policies without stockholder approval.\nOur investment, financing, borrowing and dividend policies and our policies with respect to all other activities, including growth, debt, capitalization and operations, will be determined by our Board of Directors. These policies may be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of the Board of Directors without a vote of our stockholders. In addition, the Board of Directors may change our policies with respect to conflicts of interest provided that such changes are consistent with applicable legal requirements. A change in these policies could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nCompensation awards to our management may not be tied to or correspond with our improved financial results or share price.\nThe compensation committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our compensation and employee benefit plans and practices, including our executive compensation plans and our incentive compensation and equity-based compensation plans. Our compensation committee has significant discretion in structuring compensation packages and may make compensation decisions based on any number of factors. As a result, compensation awards may not be tied to or correspond with improved financial results for the Company or the share price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of preferred stock.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that our Board of Directors will be authorized to issue from time to time, without further stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix or alter the designations, preferences, rights and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the shares of each series, including the dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, including sinking fund provisions, redemption price or prices, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series or designations of any series. Such shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. We may issue additional preferred stock in ways which may delay, defer or prevent a change in control of the Company without further action by our stockholders. Such shares of preferred stock may be issued with voting rights that may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock by increasing the number of outstanding shares having voting rights, and by the creation of class or series voting rights.\nOur payment of future quarterly dividends on our common stock is subject to the discretion and approval of our Board of Directors.\nOn August 6, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the initiation of the Quarterly Cash Dividend program of $0.025 per share of the Company\u2019s common stock or $0.10 per share on an annualized basis. We temporarily replaced the Quarterly Cash Dividend with a Quarterly Stock Dividend during portions of the 2020 fiscal year in light of the operational impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While we intend to pay regular Quarterly Cash Dividends for the foreseeable future, all subsequent dividends will be\nreviewed quarterly and declared at the discretion and approval of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions, contractual restrictions under our credit facility on the payment of dividends, legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends, and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Therefore, you should not purchase our common stock if you need immediate or future income by way of dividends from your investment. In addition, upon an event of default under our credit facility, we are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends on our common stock or generally making other distributions to our stockholders.\nShares of our common stock have been, and may continue to be, thinly traded, which may contribute to volatility in our stock price and less liquidity for investors.\nThe trading volume of our common stock has varied, and at times may be characterized as thinly traded. As a result of this thin trading market or \u201cfloat\u201d for our common stock, our common stock has been, and may continue to be, less liquid than the common stock of companies with broader public ownership. If our common stock is thinly traded, the trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our common stock than would be the case if our float were larger. As a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile than the common stock of companies with broader public ownership, and an investor to be unable to liquidate an investment in our common stock at attractive prices.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade in the future. Variations in financial results, announcements of material events, changes in our dividend policy, technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, our quarterly operating results, changes in general conditions in the economy or the outdoor and consumer industries, other developments affecting us or our competitors or general price and volume fluctuations in the market are among the many factors that could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nThe sale of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nWe have outstanding an aggregate of 37,199,359 shares of our common stock as of March 2, 2022. This includes 6,578,587 shares of common stock that are beneficially owned by Mr. Kanders, our Chairman of the Board, of which he has 4,840,971 hypothecated and/or pledged as security for loans from financial institutions, which hypothecation has been in place for over ten years, and that may be sold by such financial institutions in the event of a foreclosure of these loans. The sale of a significant amount of shares at any given time, or the perception that such sales could occur, including sales of the shares beneficially owned by Mr. Kanders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nWe may issue a substantial amount of our common stock in the future, which could cause dilution to current investors and otherwise adversely affect our stock price.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock as consideration for such acquisition. These issuances could be significant. To the extent that we make acquisitions and issue our shares of common stock as consideration, your equity interest in us will be diluted. Any such issuance will also increase the number of outstanding shares of common stock that will be eligible for sale in the future. Persons receiving shares of our common stock in connection with these acquisitions may be more likely to sell off their common stock, which may influence the price of our common stock. In addition, the potential issuance of additional shares in connection with anticipated acquisitions could lessen demand for our common stock and result in a lower price than might otherwise be obtained. We may issue common stock in the future for other purposes as well, including in connection with financings, for compensation purposes, in connection with strategic transactions or for other purposes. The issuance of a large number of shares of common stock in connection with an acquisition could also have a negative effect on our ability to use our NOLs.", "PERMNO": 86092, "SIC": 3949, "TIC": "CLAR"}
