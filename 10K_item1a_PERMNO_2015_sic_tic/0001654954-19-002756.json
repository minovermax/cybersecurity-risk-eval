{"cik": "738214", "company": "AEMETIS, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in an evolving industry that presents numerous risks beyond our control that are driven by factors that cannot be predicted. Should any of the risks described in this section or in the documents incorporated by reference in this report actually occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price could be materially and adversely affected. Investors should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below, in addition to the other information in this report, before making any investment in our securities.\nRisks Related to our Overall Business\nWe are currently not profitable and historically, we have incurred significant losses. If we incur continued losses, we may have to curtail our operations, which may prevent us from successfully operating and expanding our business.\nHistorically, we have relied upon cash from debt and equity financing activities to fund substantially all of the cash requirements of our activities. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $193.2 million. For our fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we reported a net loss of $36.3 million and $31.8 million, respectively. We may incur losses for an indeterminate period of time and may not achieve consistent profitability. We expect to rely on cash on hand, cash, if any, generated from our operations, borrowing availability under our lines of credit and proceeds from future financing activities, if any, to fund all of the cash requirements of our business. In some market environments, we may have limited access to incremental financing, which could defer or cancel growth projects, reduce business activity or cause us to default on our existing debt agreements if we are unable to meet our payment schedules. An extended period of losses or negative cash flow may prevent us from successfully operating and expanding our business.\nOur indebtedness and interest expense could limit cash flow and adversely affect operations and our ability to make full payment on outstanding debt.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $18.2 million in interest rate expense (excludes debt related fees and amortization expense), primarily due to higher debt balances in 2018. Our high levels of interest expense pose potential risks such as:\n\u25cf\nA substantial portion of cash flows from operations are used to pay principal and interest on debt, thereby reducing the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf\nInsufficient cash flows from operations may force us to sell assets, or seek additional capital, which we may not be able to accomplish on favorable terms, if at all; and\n\u25cf\nThe level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns.\nAdditionally, we have guaranteed the obligations of a variable interest entity that is included in our consolidated financial statements, which could require us to make payments on the outstanding debt of the variable interest entity that would limit our cash flow and could adversely affect our operations. In July 2017, we entered into a limited guaranty with Third Eye Capital in connection with a note purchase agreement entered into by our variable interest entity GAFI and Third Eye Capital (the \u201cGAFI Debt\u201d). As of December 31, 2018, GAFI\u2019s outstanding balance of principal, interest and fees on the GAFI Debt equaled $27.1 million, excluding debt discounts. Any inability by GAFI to repay the GAFI debt would require us to fulfill our guarantee to Third Eye Capital, which would limit our cash flow and adversely affect our operations.\nOur business is dependent on external financing and cash from operations to service debt and provide future growth.\nThe adoption of new technologies at our ethanol and biodiesel plants and our working capital requirements are financed in part through debt facilities. We may need to seek additional financing to continue or grow our operations. However, generally unfavorable credit market conditions may make it difficult to obtain necessary capital or additional debt financing on commercially viable terms or at all. If we are unable to pay our debt, we may be forced to delay or cancel capital expenditures, sell assets, restructure our indebtedness, seek additional financing, or file for bankruptcy protection. Debt levels or debt service requirements may limit our ability to borrow additional capital, make us vulnerable to increases in prevailing interest rates, subject our assets to liens, limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions, or place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors. Should we be unable to generate enough cash from our operations or secure additional financing to fund our operations and debt service requirements, we may be required to postpone or cancel growth projects, reduce our operations, or may be unable to meet our debt repayment schedules. Any one of these events would likely have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.\nThere can be no assurance that our existing cash flow from operations will be sufficient to sustain operations and to the extent that we are dependent on credit facilities to fund operations or service debt, there can be no assurances that we will be successful at securing funding from our senior lender or significant shareholders. Should we require additional financing, there can be no assurances that the additional financing will be available on terms satisfactory to us. Our ability to identify and enter into commercial arrangements with feedstock suppliers in India depends on maintaining our operations agreement with Gemini Edibles and Fats India Private Limited (Gemini) and Secunderabad Oils Limited (SOL), who are currently providing us with working capital for our Kakinada facility and British Petroleum business operations respectively. If we are unable to maintain this strategic relationship, our business may be negatively affected. In addition, the ability of Gemini and SOL to continue to provide us with working capital depends in part on the financial strength of them and their banking relationships. If Gemini and SOL are unable or unwilling to continue to provide us with working capital, our business may be negatively affected. Our ability to enter into commercial arrangements with feedstock suppliers in California depends on maintaining our operations agreement with J.D. Heiskell, who is currently providing us with working capital for our Keyes Plant. If we are unable to maintain this strategic relationship, our business may be negatively affected. In addition, the ability of J.D. Heiskell to continue to provide us with working capital depends in part on the financial strength of J.D. Heiskell and its banking relationships. If J.D. Heiskell is unable or unwilling to continue to provide us with working capital, our business may be negatively affected. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the classification or carrying values of our assets or liabilities that might be necessary as a result of the outcome of this uncertainty.\nWe may be unable to repay or refinance our Third Eye Capital Notes upon maturity.\nUnder our note facilities with Third Eye Capital, we owe approximately $ 91.3 million excluding GAFI notes and debt discounts, as of December 31, 2018. Our indebtedness and interest payments under these note facilities are currently substantial and may adversely affect our cash flow, cash position and stock price. The maturity date of these notes is April 2020, and the maturity can be further extended to April 2021 upon payment of certain fees. We have been able to extend our indebtedness in the past, but we may not be able to continue to extend the maturity of these notes. We may not have sufficient cash available at the time of maturity to repay this indebtedness. We have default covenants that may accelerate the maturities of these notes. We may not have sufficient assets or cash flow available to support refinancing these notes at market rates or on terms that are satisfactory to us. If we are unable to extend the maturity of the notes or refinance on terms satisfactory to us, we may be forced to refinance on terms that are materially less favorable, seek funds through other means such as a sale of some of our assets or otherwise significantly alter our operating plan, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if we are unable to amend our current note purchase agreement with Third Eye Capital, our ability to pay dividends could be restrained.\nWe are dependent upon our working capital agreements with J.D. Heiskell and Gemini Edibles and Fats India Private Limited and Secunderabad Oils Limited.\nOur ability to operate our Keyes Plant depends on maintaining our working capital agreement with J.D. Heiskell, and our ability to operate the Kakinada Plant depends on maintaining our working capital agreement with Gemini and SOL. The Heiskell Agreement provides for an initial term of one year with automatic one-year renewals; provided, however, that J.D. Heiskell may terminate the agreement by notice 90 days prior to the end of the initial term or any renewal term. The current term extends through December 31, 2019. In addition, the agreement may be terminated at any time upon an event of default, such as payment default, bankruptcy, acts of fraud or material breach under one of our related agreements with J.D. Heiskell. The Gemini and SOL agreements may be terminated at any time by either party upon written notice. If we are unable to maintain these strategic relationships, we will be required to locate alternative sources of working capital and corn or milo supply, which we may be unable to do in a timely manner or at all. If we are unable to maintain our current working capital arrangements or locate alternative sources of working capital, our ability to operate our plants will be negatively affected.\nDisruptions in ethanol production infrastructure may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends on the continuing availability of rail, road, port, and storage and distribution infrastructure. In particular, due to limited storage capacity at the Keyes Plant and other considerations related to production efficiencies, the Keyes Plant depends on just-in-time delivery of corn and milo. The delivery and transformation of feedstock requires a significant and uninterrupted supply of corn and milo, principally delivered by rail, as well as other raw materials and energy, primarily electricity and natural gas. The prices of rail, electricity and natural gas have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future. The national rail system, as well as local electricity and gas utilities, may not be able to reliably supply the rail logistics, electricity and natural gas that the Keyes Plant will need or may not be able to supply those resources on acceptable terms. Any disruptions in the ethanol production infrastructure, whether caused by labor difficulties, earthquakes, storms, other natural disasters, or human error or malfeasance or other reasons, could prevent timely deliveries of corn, milo or other raw materials and energy and may require the Keyes Plant to halt production, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results from operations are primarily dependent on the spread between the feedstock and energy we purchase and the fuel, animal feed and other products we sell.\nThe results of our ethanol production business in the U.S. are significantly affected by the spread between the cost of the corn and natural gas that we purchase and the price of the ethanol, WDG and DCO that we sell. Similarly, in India our biodiesel business is primarily dependent on the price difference between the costs of the feedstock we purchase (principally NRPO and crude glycerin) and the products we sell (principally distilled biodiesel and refined glycerin). The markets for ethanol, biodiesel, WDG, DCO and glycerin are highly volatile and subject to significant fluctuations. Any decrease in the spread between prices of the commodities we buy and sell, whether as a result of an increase in feedstock prices or a reduction in ethanol or biodiesel prices, would adversely affect our financial performance and cash flow and may cause us to suspend production at either of our plants.\nThe price of ethanol is volatile and subject to large fluctuations, and increased ethanol production may cause a decline in ethanol prices or prevent ethanol prices from rising, either of which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe market price of ethanol is volatile and subject to large fluctuations. The market price of ethanol is dependent upon many factors, including the supply of ethanol and the demand for gasoline, which is in turn dependent upon the price of petroleum, which is also highly volatile and difficult to forecast. Fluctuations in the market price of ethanol may cause our profitability or losses to fluctuate significantly. In addition, domestic ethanol production capacity increased significantly in the last decade. Demand for ethanol may not increase commensurately with increases in supply, which could lead to lower ethanol prices. Demand for ethanol could be impaired due to a number of factors, including regulatory developments and reduced United States gasoline consumption. Reduced gasoline consumption has occurred in the past and could occur in the future as a result of increased gasoline or oil prices.\nDecreasing gasoline prices may negatively impact the selling price of ethanol which could reduce our ability to operate profitably.\nThe price of ethanol tends to change in relation to the price of gasoline. Recently, as a result of a number of factors including the current world economy, the price of gasoline has decreased. In correlation to the decrease in the price of gasoline, the price of ethanol has also decreased. Decreases in the price of ethanol reduce our revenue. Our profitability depends on a favorable spread between our corn and natural gas costs and the price we receive for our ethanol. If ethanol prices fall during times when corn and/or natural gas prices are high, we may not be able to operate profitably.\nWe may be unable to execute our business plan.\nThe value of our long-lived assets is based on our ability to execute our business plan and generate sufficient cash flow to justify the carrying value of our assets. Should we fall short of our cash flow projections, we may be required to write down the value of these assets under accounting rules and further reduce the value of our assets. We can make no assurances that future cash flows will develop and provide us with sufficient cash to maintain the value of these assets, thus avoiding future impairment to our asset carrying values. As a result, we may need to write down the carrying value of our long-lived assets.\nIn addition, we intend to modify or adapt third party technologies at the Keyes Plant and at the Kakinada Plant to accommodate alternative feedstocks and improve operations. After we design and engineer a specific integrated upgrade to either or both plants to allow us to produce products other than their existing products, we may not receive permission from the regulatory agencies to install the process at one or both plants. Additionally, even if we are able to install and begin operations of an integrated advanced fuels and/or bio-chemical plant, we cannot assure you that the technology will work and produce cost effective products because we have never designed, engineered nor built this technology into an existing bio-refinery. Similarly, our plans to add a CO2 conversion unit at the Keyes Plant may not be successful as a result of financing, issues in the design or construction process, or our ability to sell liquid CO2 at cost effective prices. Any inability to execute our business plan may have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position, ability to pay dividends, and ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial investments in capital improvements and additions, and the actual cost of such improvements and additions may be significantly higher than we anticipate.\nOur strategy calls for continued investment in capital improvements and additions. For example, we are currently developing the Riverbank Cellulosic Ethanol Facility in Riverbank, CA to utilize the LanzaTech and InEnTec Technologies to convert local California surplus biomass into ultra-low carbon renewable cellulosic ethanol and evaluating the Goodland facility in Goodland, KS for construction of an additional cellulosic ethanol facility. The construction of these capital improvements and additions involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed our estimates. These projects may not be completed at the planned cost, on schedule or at all. The construction of new ethanol and other biofuel facilities is subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs, costs of equipment and materials such as steel, labor shortages or weather or other delays, inflation or other factors, which could be material. In addition, the construction of these facilities is typically subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies. Those agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner, if at all, or may impose restrictions or conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent a project from proceeding, lengthen its expected completion schedule and/or increase its anticipated cost. Moreover, our revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if we expand an existing facility or construct a new facility, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and we may not receive any material increases in revenues or cash flows until the project is completed. As a result, the new facilities may not be able to achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on, and vulnerable to any difficulties of, our principal suppliers and customers.\nWe buy all of the feedstock for the Keyes Plant from one supplier, J.D. Heiskell. Under the Heiskell Agreement, we are only permitted to purchase feedstock from other suppliers upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. In addition, we have contracted to sell all of the WDG, CDS, corn oil and ethanol we produce at the Keyes Plant to J.D. Heiskell. J.D. Heiskell, in turn, sells all ethanol produced at the Keyes Plant to Kinergy Marketing and all WDG and syrup to A.L. Gilbert. If J.D. Heiskell were to fail to deliver adequate feedstock to the Keyes Plant or fail to purchase all the product we produce, if Kinergy were to fail to purchase all of the ethanol we produce, if A.L. Gilbert were to fail to purchase all of the WDG and syrup we produce, or if any of them were otherwise to default on our agreements with them or fail to perform as expected, we may be unable to find replacement suppliers or purchasers, or both, in a reasonable time or on favorable terms, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not receive the funds we expect under our EB-5 program.\nOur EB-5 Phase I program allows for the issuance of up to 72 subordinated convertible promissory notes, each in the amount of $0.5 million due and payable four years from the date of the note for a total aggregate principal amount of up to $36.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, $35.5 million has been raised through the EB-5 program, of which $35.0 million have been released from escrow, the EB-5 escrow account is holding funds in the amount of $0.5 million from one investor pending approval by the USCIS, and $0.5 million remain to be funded to escrow. Additionally, the USCIS could deny approval of the loans, and then we would not receive some or all of the subscribed funds. If the USCIS takes longer to approve the release of funds in escrow, or does not approve the loans at all, it would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows available for operations, and thus could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOn October 16, 2016, we launched our EB-5 Phase II program, allowing for the issuance of up to 100 subordinated convertible promissory notes, on substantially similar terms and conditions as those issued under our EB-5 Phase II program, for a total aggregate principal amount of up to $50.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, $1.5 million have been raised through the EB-5 Phase II, all of which have been released from escrow.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully raise additional funds under our EB-5 Phase II program or that such funds, if raised, will be approved by USCIS. If we are unable to raise, receive approval for, or receive any funds under our EB-5 Phase II program, our business may be negatively affected.\nWe face competition for our bio-chemical and transportation fuels products from providers of petroleum-based products and from other companies seeking to provide alternatives to these products, many of whom have greater resources and experience than we do, and if we cannot compete effectively against these companies we may not be successful.\nOur renewable products compete with both the traditional, largely petroleum-based bio-chemical and fuels products that are currently being used in our target markets and with the alternatives to these existing products that established enterprises and new companies are seeking to produce. The oil companies, large chemical companies and well-established agricultural products companies with whom we compete are much larger than we are, and have, in many cases, well developed distribution systems and networks for their products.\nIn the transportation fuels market, we compete with independent and integrated oil refiners, advanced biofuels companies and biodiesel companies. Refiners compete with us by selling traditional fuel products and some are also pursuing hydrocarbon fuel production using non-renewable feedstocks, such as natural gas and coal, as well as processes using renewable feedstocks, such as vegetable oil and biomass. We also expect to compete with companies that are developing the capacity to produce diesel and other transportation fuels from renewable resources in other ways.\nWith the emergence of many new companies seeking to produce chemicals and fuels from alternative sources, we may face increasing competition from alternative fuels and chemicals companies. As they emerge, some of these companies may be able to establish production capacity and commercial partnerships to compete with us. If we are unable to establish production and sales channels that allow us to offer comparable products at attractive prices, we may not be able to compete effectively with these companies.\nWe also face competition from international suppliers. Ethanol can be imported into the United States duty-free from some countries, which may undermine the domestic ethanol industry. Currently, international suppliers produce ethanol primarily from sugar cane and as such, production costs for ethanol in these countries can be significantly less than those in the United States and the import of lower price or lower carbon value ethanol from these countries may reduce the demand for domestic ethanol and depress the price at which we sell our ethanol.\nThe high concentration of our sales within the ethanol production industry could result in a significant reduction in sales and negatively affect our profitability if demand for ethanol declines.\nWe expect our U.S. operations to be substantially focused on the production of ethanol and its co-products for the foreseeable future. We may be unable to shift our business focus away from the production of ethanol to other renewable fuels or competing products. Accordingly, an industry shift away from ethanol or the emergence of new competing products may reduce the demand for ethanol. A downturn in the demand for ethanol could materially and adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nOur operations are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws, regulations, and liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, access to and impacts on water supply, and the health and safety of our employees. In addition, our operations and sales in India subject us to risks associated with foreign laws, policies and regulations. Some of these laws and regulations require our facilities to operate under permits or licenses that are subject to renewal or modification. These laws, regulations and permits can require expensive emissions testing and pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. Violations of these laws, regulations or permit, or license conditions can result in substantial fines, natural resource damages, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and facility shutdowns. We may not be at all times in compliance with these laws, regulations, permits or licenses or we may not have all permits or licenses required to operate our business. We may be subject to legal actions brought by environmental advocacy groups and other parties for actual or alleged violations of environmental laws, permits or licenses. In addition, we may be required to make significant capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws, regulations, and permit and license requirements.\nWe may be liable for the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at the Keyes Plant and at off-site locations where we arrange for the disposal of hazardous substances. If hazardous substances have been or are disposed of or released at sites that undergo investigation or remediation by regulatory agencies, we may be responsible under CERCLA or other environmental laws for all or part of the costs of investigation and remediation, and for damage to natural resources. We also may be subject to related claims by private parties alleging property damage and personal injury due to exposure to hazardous or other materials at or from those properties. Some of these matters may require us to expend significant amounts for investigation, cleanup or other costs.\nNew laws, new interpretations of existing laws, increased governmental enforcement of environmental laws or other developments could require us to make additional significant expenditures. Continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues can be expected to result in increased future investments for environmental controls at our production facilities. Environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations now or in the future, more vigorous enforcement policies and discovery of currently unknown conditions may require substantial expenditures that could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nEmissions of carbon dioxide resulting from manufacturing ethanol are not currently subject to permit requirements. If new laws or regulations are passed relating to the production, disposal or emissions of carbon dioxide, we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with such new laws or regulations.\nOur business is affected by greenhouse gas and climate change regulation.\nThe operations at our Keyes Plant will result in the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In March 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on the Renewable Fuels Standard Program, or RFS. We believe the EPA\u2019s final RFS regulations grandfather the Keyes facility we operate at its current capacity. However, compliance with future legislation may require us to take action unknown to us at this time that could be costly, and require the use of working capital, which may or may not be available, preventing us from operating as planned, which may have a material adverse effect on our operations and cash flow.\nA change in government policies may cause a decline in the demand for our products.\nThe domestic ethanol industry is highly dependent upon a myriad of federal and state regulations and legislation, and any changes in legislation or regulation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Other federal and state programs benefiting ethanol generally are subject to U.S. government obligations under international trade agreements, including those under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and may be the subject of challenges, in whole or in part. Growth and demand for ethanol and biodiesel is largely driven by federal and state government mandates or blending requirements, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which was implemented pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (the \u201cEISA\u201d). The RFS program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels (such as ethanol) that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the United States. However, legislation aimed at reducing or eliminating the renewable fuel use required by the RFS has been introduced in the United States Congress. Any change in government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations.\nWaivers of the RFS minimum levels of renewable fuels included in gasoline could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Under the Energy Policy Act, the U.S. Department of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy, may waive the renewable fuels mandate with respect to one or more states if the Administrator of the EPA determines that implementing the requirements would severely harm the economy or the environment of a state, a region or the nation, or that there is inadequate supply to meet the requirement. Any waiver of the RFS with respect to one or more states would reduce demand for ethanol and could cause our results of operations to decline and our financial condition to suffer.\nA critical state program is California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, (\"LCFS\"), which is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation fuels used in California by ensuring that the fuel sold meets declining targets for such emissions. The regulation quantifies lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by assigning a \u201ccarbon intensity\u201d (\"CI\") score to each transportation fuel based on that fuel\u2019s lifecycle assessment. Each petroleum fuel provider, generally the fuel\u2019s producer or importer (the \u201cRegulated Party\u201d), is required to ensure that the overall CI score for its fuel pool meets the annual carbon intensity target for a given year. A Regulated Party\u2019s fuel pool can include gasoline, diesel, and their blend stocks and substitutes. This obligation is tracked through credits and deficits. Fuels with a CI score lower than the annual standard earn a credit, and fuels that are higher than the standard result in a deficit. Credits can be traded. Any changes to California\u2019s LCFS could cause our results of operations to decline and our financial condition to suffer.\nConcerns regarding the environmental impact of biofuel production could affect public policy which could impair our ability to operate at a profit and substantially harm our revenues and operating margins.\nUnder the EISA, the EPA is required to produce a study every three years of the environmental impacts associated with current and future biofuel production and use, including effects on air and water quality, soil quality and conservation, water availability, energy recovery from secondary materials, ecosystem health and biodiversity, invasive species and international impacts. Should such EPA triennial studies, or other analyses find that biofuel production and use has resulted in, or could in the future result in, adverse environmental impacts, such findings could also negatively impact public perception and acceptance of biofuel as an alternative fuel, which also could result in the loss of political support. To the extent that state or federal laws are modified or public perception turns against biofuels, use requirements such as RFS and LCFS may not continue, which could materially harm our ability to operate profitably.\nWe may encounter unanticipated difficulties in converting the Keyes Plant to accommodate alternative feedstocks, new chemicals used in the fermentation and distillation process or new mechanical production equipment.\nIn order to improve the operations of the Keyes Plant and execute on our business plan, we intend to modify the Keyes Plant to accommodate alternative feedstocks and new chemical and/or mechanical production processes. We may not be able to successfully implement these modifications, and they may not function as we expect them to. These modifications may cost significantly more to complete than our estimates. The Keyes Plant may not operate at nameplate capacity once the changes are complete. If any of these risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe may be subject to liabilities and losses that may not be covered by insurance.\nOur employees and facilities are subject to the hazards associated with producing ethanol and biodiesel. Operating hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to, or destruction of, property, plant and equipment and environmental damage. We maintain insurance coverage in amounts and against the risks that we believe are consistent with industry practice. However, we could sustain losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks, or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. Events that result in significant personal injury or damage to our property or to property owned by third parties or other losses that are not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nInsurance liabilities are difficult to assess and quantify due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If we were to experience insurance claims or costs above our coverage limits or that are not covered by our insurance, we might be required to use working capital to satisfy these claims rather than to maintain or expand our operations. To the extent that we experience a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or workers\u2019 compensation claims, or unfavorable developments on existing claims, our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on recruiting and retaining key personnel and, if we fail to do so, it may be more difficult for us to execute our business strategy.\nOur success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, manufacturing and scientific personnel, in particular our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Eric McAfee. We do not maintain any key person insurance. Competition for qualified personnel in the renewable fuel and bio-chemicals manufacturing fields is intense. Our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to retain our current key personnel, and attract and retain qualified future key personnel, particularly executive management. Failure to attract or retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur operations subject us to risks associated with foreign laws, policies, regulations, and markets.\nOur sales and manufacturing operations in foreign countries are subject to the laws, policies, regulations, and markets of the countries in which we operate. As a result, our foreign manufacturing operations and sales are subject to inherent risks associated with the countries in which we operate. Risks involving our foreign operations include differences or unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, political and economic instability, terrorism and civil unrest, work stoppages or strikes, natural disasters, interruptions in transportation, restrictions on the export or import of technology, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, variations in tariffs, quotas, taxes, and other market barriers, longer payment cycles, changes in economic conditions in the international markets in which our products are sold, and greater fluctuations in sales to customers in developing countries. Any inability to effectively manage the risks associated with our foreign operations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nOur operations in countries outside the United States, including our operations in India, are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201dFCPA\u201d). The FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices.\nOur employees and agents interact with government officials on our behalf, including interactions necessary to obtain licenses and other regulatory approvals necessary to operate our business. These interactions create a risk that actions may occur that could violate the FCPA or other similar laws.\nAlthough we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with local laws and regulations as well as U.S. laws and regulations, including the FCPA, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants, contractors and agents will abide by our policies. If we are found to be liable for violations of the FCPA or similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions, either due to our own acts or out of inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nA substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in India, and we are subject to regulatory, economic and political uncertainties in India.\nCertain of our principal operating subsidiaries are incorporated in India, and substantial portions of our assets are located in India. We intend to continue to develop and expand our facilities in India. The Indian government has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the Indian economy. India\u2019s government has traditionally maintained an artificially low price for certain commodities, including diesel fuel, through subsidies, but has recently begun to reduce such subsidies, which benefits us. We cannot assure you that liberalization policies will continue. Various factors, such as changes in the current federal government, could trigger significant changes in India\u2019s economic liberalization and deregulation policies and disrupt business and economic conditions in India generally and our business in particular. Our financial performance may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and economic and fiscal policy in India, including changes in exchange rates and controls, interest rates and taxation policies, as well as social stability and political, economic or diplomatic developments affecting India in the future.\nCurrency fluctuations between the Indian Rupee and the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our revenues is denominated in Rupees. We report our financial results in U.S. dollars. The exchange rates between the Rupee and the U.S. dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future. We do not currently engage in any formal currency hedging of our foreign currency exposure, and our results of operations may be adversely affected if the Rupee fluctuates significantly against the U.S. dollar.\nWe are a holding company and there are significant limitations on our ability to receive distributions from our subsidiaries.\nWe conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries and are dependent on cash distributions, dividends or other intercompany transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to finance our operations. Our subsidiaries have not made significant distributions to us and may not have funds available for dividends or distributions in the future. The ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us will be dependent upon their respective abilities to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including subsidiary-level debt service on their respective credit agreements. Our current credit agreement, the Third Eye Capital Note Purchase Agreement, as amended from time to time, described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, requires us to obtain the prior consent of Third Eye Capital, as the Administrative Agent of the Note holders, to make cash distributions or any intercompany fund transfers. The ability of our Indian operating subsidiary to transfer funds to us is restricted by Indian laws and may be adversely affected by U.S. federal income tax laws. Under Indian laws, our capital contributions, or future capital contributions, to our Indian operation cannot be remitted back to the U.S. Remittance of funds by our Indian subsidiary to us may subject us to significant tax liabilities under U.S. federal income tax laws.\nOur Chief Executive Officer has outside business interests that could require time and attention.\nEric McAfee, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has outside business interests which include his ownership of McAfee Capital. Although Mr. McAfee\u2019s employment agreement requires that he devote reasonable business efforts to our company and prohibits him from engaging in any competitive employment, occupational and consulting services, this agreement also permits him to devote time to his outside business interests consistent with past practice. As a result, these outside business interests could interfere with Mr. McAfee\u2019s ability to devote time to our business and affairs.\nOur business may be subject to natural forces beyond our control.\nEarthquakes, floods, droughts, tsunamis, and other unfavorable weather conditions may affect our operations. Natural catastrophes may have a detrimental effect on our supply and distribution channels, causing a delay or preventing our receipt of raw materials from our suppliers or delivery of finished goods to our customers. In addition, weather conditions may adversely impact the planting, growth, harvest, storage, and general availability of any number of the products we may process at our facilities or sell to our customers. The severity of these occurrences, should they ever occur, will determine the extent to which and if our business is materially and adversely affected.\nOur ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards may be limited.\nUnder the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation is generally allowed a deduction in any taxable year for net operating losses (\u201cNOL\u201d) carried over from prior taxable years. As of December 31, 2018, we had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $188.0 million and state NOL carryforwards of approximately $195.0 million. These federal and state net operating loss and other tax credit carryforwards expire on various dates between 2027 and 2037. Due to 2017 U.S. Tax Reform, U.S. federal NOL\u2019s created after 2017 no longer expire. Federal NOL carryforwards of $11.0 million as of December 31, 2018 which have no expiration date.\nOur ability to deduct these NOL carryforwards against future taxable income could be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. In general, an ownership change may result from one or more transactions increasing the aggregate ownership of certain persons (or groups of persons) in our stock by more than 50 percentage points over a testing period (generally three years). Future direct or indirect changes in the ownership of our stock, including sales or acquisitions of our stock by certain stockholders and purchases and issuances of our stock by us, some of which are not in our control, could result in an ownership change. Any resulting limitation on the use of our NOL carryforwards could result in the payment of taxes above the amounts currently estimated and could have a negative effect on our future results of operations and financial position.\nU.S. tax law changes could materially affect the tax aspects of our business and the industries in which we compete.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d) was signed into law by President Trump. Under the 2017 Tax Act, certain corporate tax provisions were amended, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate, the implementation of a territorial tax system and the creation of a one-time repatriation tax on foreign earnings. As a result of the enacted reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate, we recorded a one-time, non-cash increase to deferred income tax expense of $19.6 million to revalue the Company\u2019s net deferred tax asset. The one-time revaluation was based on our current knowledge, interpretation and understanding of the 2017 Tax Act and its impact to our business. Other aspects of the 2017 Tax Act including, but not limited to, the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal taxes and the interest expense deduction limitation, may have additional material impacts on our effective tax rate and net income as reported under GAAP, and there can be no assurances that such impacts will be favorable. Additional changes under the 2017 Tax Act could result in a potentially significant reduction in the value and utility of our U.S. federal NOLs and other tax assets, significant one-time charges in the current or future taxable years, and could increase our future tax expense. The foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition.\nNon-U.S. stockholders of our common stock, in certain situations, could be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the gain from the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common stock.\nOur ethanol plant in Keyes, California (which constitutes a U.S. real property interest for purposes of determining whether we are a U.S. real property holding corporation (a \u201cUSRPHC\u201d) under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act (\u201cFIRPTA\u201d)), currently accounts for a significant portion of our assets. The value of our Keyes Plant relative to our real property located outside of the United States and other assets used in our trade or business may be uncertain and may fluctuate over time. Therefore, we may be, now or at any time while a non-U.S. stockholder owns our common stock, a USRPHC. If we are a USRPHC, certain non-U.S. stockholders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain from the disposition of our stock under FIRPTA, in which case such non-U.S. stockholders would also be required to file U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such gain. Whether the FIRPTA provisions apply depends on the stock that a non-U.S. stockholder owns and whether, at the time such non-U.S. stockholder disposes of our common stock, such common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market within the meaning of the applicable U.S. Treasury regulations. Non-U.S. stockholders should consult with their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common stock.\nWe are subject to covenants and other operating restrictions under the terms of our debt, which may restrict our ability to engage in some business transactions.\nOur debt facilities contain covenants restricting our ability, among others, to:\n\u25cf\nincur additional debt;\n\u25cf\nmake certain capital expenditures;\n\u25cf\nincur or permit liens to exist;\n\u25cf\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf\nguarantee the debt of other entities, including joint ventures;\n\u25cf\npay dividends;\n\u25cf\nmerge or consolidate or otherwise combine with another company; and\n\u25cf\ntransfer, sell or lease our assets.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to engage in business transactions that may be beneficial to us, or may restrict our ability to execute our business plan.\nOperational difficulties at our facilities may negatively impact our business.\nOur operations may experience unscheduled downtimes due to technical or structural failure, political and economic instability, terrorism and civil unrest, natural disasters, and other operational hazards inherent to our operations. These hazards may cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, equipment, or the environment, and may result in the suspension of operations or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover such potential hazards and we may not be able to renew our insurance on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, any reduction in the yield or quality of the products we produce could negatively impact our ability to market our products. Any decrease in the quality, reduction in volume, or cessation of our operations due to these hazards would have a material adverse effect on the results of our business and financial condition.\nOur success depends on our ability to manage the growth of our operations.\nOur strategy envisions a period of rapid growth that may impose a significant burden on our administrative and operational resources and personnel, which, if not effectively managed, could impair our growth. The growth of our business will require significant investments of capital and management\u2019s close attention. If we are unable to successfully manage our growth, our sales may not increase commensurately with capital expenditures and investments. Our ability to effectively manage our growth will require us to substantially expand the capabilities of our administrative and operational resources and to attract, train, manage and retain qualified management, technicians and other personnel. In addition to our plans to adopt technologies that expand our operations and product offerings at our biodiesel and ethanol plants, we may seek to enter into strategic business relationships with companies to expand our operations. If we are unable to successfully manage our growth, we may be unable to achieve our business goals, which may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and financial condition.\nOur mergers, acquisitions, partnerships, and joint ventures may not be as beneficial as we anticipate.\nWe have increased our operations through mergers, acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures and intend to continue to explore these opportunities in the future. The anticipated benefits of these transactions might take longer to realize than expected and these may never be fully realized, or even realized at all. Furthermore, partnerships and joint ventures generally involve restrictive covenants on the parties involved, which may limit our ability to manage these agreements in a manner that is in our best interest. Future mergers, acquisitions, partnerships, and joint ventures may involve the issuance of debt or equity, or a combination of the two, as payment for or financing of the business or assets involved, which may dilute ownership interest in our business. Any failure to adequately evaluate and address the risks of and execute on our mergers, acquisitions, partnerships, and joint ventures could have an adverse material effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In connection with such acquisitions and strategic transactions, we may incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits, have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses, our management may become distracted from our core business, and we may disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business.\nEdenIQ\u2019s attempt to terminate and failure to close the EdenIQ Merger, and litigation pertaining to the EdenIQ Merger, may negatively impact our business and operations.\nOn August 31, 2016, the Company filed a lawsuit in Santa Clara County Superior Court against EdenIQ and its CEO, Brian D. Thome. The lawsuit is based on EdenIQ\u2019s wrongful termination of a merger agreement (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) that would have effectuated the merger of the Company and EdenIQ (the \u201cEdenIQ Merger\u201d). The relief sought includes specific performance of the merger agreement and monetary damages, as well as punitive damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs. By way of its cross-complaint, EdenIQ sought monetary damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. All of the claims asserted by both the Company and EdenIQ have been denied or dismissed. The Company and EdenIQ have filed motions for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, which motions are currently pending. The Company seeks $1,775,043 by its motion and EdenIQ seeks $8,481,600.40 on its motion. The Company vigorously disputes EdenIQ\u2019s position and supports its own position. We cannot predict the outcome of such litigation. Such litigation may also create a distraction for our management team and board of directors and require time and attention. Any litigation relating to the EdenIQ Merger or EdenIQ\u2019s wrongful termination of and failure to close the EdenIQ Merger would adversely affect our ability to leverage EdenIQ\u2019s technologies for the development of additional advanced biofuels and renewable chemicals and could adversely impact our ability to execute our business plan, our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be significantly disrupted upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event or cyberattack.\nOur Keyes and Kakinada Plants are highly automated and rely extensively on the availability of our network infrastructure and internal technology systems. The failure of our systems due to a catastrophic event, such as an earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami, weather event, telecommunications failure, power failure, cyberattack or war, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems in order to reduce the potential impact of a catastrophic event. However, there can be no assurance that these plans and systems would enable us to return to normal business operations.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade name, confidentiality agreements, and other contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and corporate partners, and control access to and distribution of our confidential information. These measures may not preclude the disclosure of our confidential or proprietary information. Despite efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information. Monitoring unauthorized use of our confidential information is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to prevent unauthorized use of our confidential information, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S., will be effective.\nCompanies in our industry aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights. From time to time, we receive notices from competitors and other operating companies, as well as notices from \u201cnon-practicing entities,\u201d or NPEs, that claim we have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. Our success and future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. It is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies and processes, or confidential employee, customer or supplier data. Any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented.\nWe may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize our technologies, which may require us to curtail or cease our research and development activities.\nSince 2007, we have been developing patent-pending enzyme technology to enable the production of ethanol from a combination of starch and cellulose, or from cellulose alone. In July 2011, we acquired Zymetis, Inc., a biochemical research and development firm, with several patents pending and in-process R&D utilizing the Z-microbe\u2122 to produce renewable chemicals and advanced fuels from renewable feedstocks. In December 2018, the Company wrote off $0.9 million of patents associated with the Z-microbeTM and enzymatic processes to facilitate the degradation of certain plant biomass as the Company no longer plans to commercially develop the technologies itself and to free up resources to pursue other methods. In 2018, in cooperation with a federally funded agency, we secured a grant from the California Energy Commission to optimize and demonstrate the effectiveness of ionic liquids technologies for breaking down biomass to produce cellulosic ethanol. To date, we have not completed a large-scale commercial prototype of our technology and are uncertain at this time when completion of a commercial scale prototype will occur. Commercialization risks include economic financial feasibility at commercial scale, availability of funding to complete large-scale commercial prototype, ability of ionic liquids to function at commercial scale and market acceptance of product.\nTechnological advances and changes in production methods in the biomass-based biofuel industry and renewable chemical industry could render our plants obsolete and adversely affect our ability to compete.\nIt is expected that technological advances in biomass-based biofuel production methods will continue to occur and new technologies for biomass-based diesel production may develop. Advances in the process of converting oils and fats into biodiesel and renewable diesel, including co-processing, could allow our competitors to produce advanced biofuels more efficiently and at a substantially lower cost. New standards or production technologies may require us to make additional capital investments in, or modify, plant operations to meet these standards. If we are unable to adapt or incorporate technological advances into our operations, our production facilities could become less competitive or obsolete. Further, it may be necessary for us to make significant expenditures to acquire any new technology and retrofit our plants in order to incorporate new technologies and remain competitive. In order to execute our strategy to expand into the production of renewable chemicals, additional advanced biofuels, next generation feedstocks and related renewable products, we may need to acquire licenses or other rights to technology from third parties. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms. If we are unable to obtain, implement or finance new technologies, our production facilities could be less efficient than our competitors, and our ability to sell biomass-based diesel may be harmed, negatively impacting our revenues and profitability.\nRisks related to ownership of our stock\nIf the trading price of our common stock fails to comply with the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ, we could face possible delisting. NASDAQ delisting could materially adversely affect the market for our shares.\nOn December 24, 2018, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of our common stock for the last 30 consecutive business days, we did not meet the minimum bid price of $1.00 per share required for continued listing on The NASDAQ Global Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a) (1). On December 28, 2018, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market indicating that, based upon the most recent publicly held shares information and the closing bid price of our common stock for the last 30 consecutive business days, we did not meet the minimum market value of publicly held shares (\u201cMVPHS\u201d) of $15,000,000 required for continued listing on The NASDAQ Global Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b) (3) (C). We have a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or June 24, 2019 with regards to the minimum bid price requirement and June 26, 2019 with regards to the MVPHS requirement, in which to regain compliance. In the event that we do not regain compliance by the dates above, we will receive written notification that our stock is subject to delisting. At that time, we would have the right to request a hearing to appeal the NASDAQ determination.\nWe cannot be sure that we will be able to regain compliance with the requirements for continued listing of our common shares on The NASDAQ Global Market, or that any appeal of a decision to delist our common shares will be successful. If our common shares lose their listed status on The NASDAQ Global Market and we are not successful in obtaining a listing on another exchange, our common shares would likely trade on the over-the-counter market.\nIf our shares were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling our common shares could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts\u2019 coverage of us may be reduced. In addition, in the event our common shares are delisted, broker-dealers have certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common shares, further limiting the liquidity of our common shares. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for common shares.\nFuture sales and issuances of rights to purchase common stock by us could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe may issue equity or convertible securities in the future. To the extent, we do so, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities, or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner, we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities, or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nOur stock price is highly volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors purchasing shares of our common stock and in litigation against us.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. The market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate in response to one or more of the following factors, many of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the market prices of ethanol and its co-products including WDG and corn oil;\n\u2022\nthe cost of key inputs to the production of ethanol, including corn and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe volume and timing of the receipt of orders for ethanol from major customers;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pricing pressures;\n\u2022\nour ability to produce, sell and deliver ethanol on a cost-effective and timely basis;\n\u2022\nthe announcement, introduction and market acceptance of one or more alternatives to ethanol;\n\u2022\nlosses resulting from adjustments to the fair values of our outstanding warrants to purchase our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of companies similar to us;\n\u2022\nstock market price and volume fluctuations generally;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments or increased enforcement;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain financing; and\n\u2022\nour financing activities and future sales of our common stock or other securities.\nThe price at which you purchase shares of our common stock may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market. You may be unable to sell your shares of common stock at or above your purchase price, which may result in substantial losses to you and which may include the complete loss of your investment. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of high stock price volatility. We may be the target of similar litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and our resources away from our business.\nAny of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or the price of our common stock, or both.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on any of our securities since inception and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on any of our securities in the foreseeable future.\nOur principal shareholders hold a substantial amount of our common stock.\nEric A. McAfee, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, and Laird Q. Cagan, a former board member, in the aggregate, beneficially own 24.4% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, the other members of our Board and management, in the aggregate, excluding Mr. McAfee, beneficially own approximately 2.5% of our common stock. Our lender, Third Eye Capital, acting as principal and agent and its affiliates, beneficially own 7.9% of our common stock. As a result, these shareholders, acting together, will be able to influence many matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of mergers and acquisitions and other significant corporate transactions. See \u201cSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management.\u201d The interests of these shareholders may differ from yours and this concentration of ownership enables these shareholders to exercise influence over many matters requiring shareholder approval, may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control, deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your securities as part of a sale of the company and may affect the market price of our securities.\nThe conversion of convertible securities and the exercise of outstanding options and warrants to purchase our common stock could substantially dilute your investment and reduce the voting power of your shares, impede our ability to obtain additional financing and cause us to incur additional expenses.\nOur Series B convertible preferred stock is convertible into our common stock. As of December 31, 2018, there were 1.3 million shares of our Series B convertible preferred stock outstanding, convertible into 132,300 shares of our common stock on a 10 to 1 ratio. Certain of our financing arrangements, such as our EB-5 notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at fixed prices. Additionally, there are outstanding warrants and options to acquire our common stock issued to employees and directors. As of December 31, 2018, there were outstanding warrants and options to purchase 3.0 million shares of our common stock.\nSuch securities allow their holders an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock such that conversion of the securities will result in dilution of the equity interests of our common stockholders. The terms on which we may obtain additional financing may be adversely affected by the existence and potentially dilutive impact of our outstanding convertible and other promissory notes, Series B convertible preferred stock, options and warrants. In addition, holders of our outstanding promissory notes and certain warrants have registration rights with respect to the common stock underlying those notes and warrants, the registration of which involves substantial expense.", "PERMNO": 14689, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "AMTX"}
