If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer, possibly materially. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Business\nWe face competition from the traditional ILECs and competition from certain other providers such as AT&T (Long Distance), Verizon Business, Level 3 Communications, Peerless Network and Hypercube, and we expect to compete with new entrants to the voice services market.\nWe face competition from the traditional ILECs, other providers such as AT&T (Long Distance), Verizon Business, Level 3 Communications, Peerless Network and Hypercube, and potentially from future entrants to the voice services market. Competition has been intense over the past several years, especially with Peerless Network, causing us to lose some traffic as well as significantly reduce certain rates we charge our customers in various markets, including with respect to our major customers in our largest markets. We expect significant competition in the voice services market to continue, including as a result of the adoption of IP-based switching by telecommunications carriers, which is likely to increase competition from direct connections. See \u201c-The market for our services is competitive and increased adoption of IP switching technologies could increase the competition we face from direct connections or result in an existing customer replacing us with one or a limited number of vendors to provide all of that customer\u2019s voice interconnection services.\u201d\nThe market for our services is competitive and increased adoption of IP switching technologies could increase the competition we face from direct connections or result in an existing customer replacing us with one or a limited number of vendors to provide all of that customer\u2019s voice interconnection services.\nWhen there is a significant amount of traffic between two of our customers\u2019 switches, there is an economic incentive to directly connect and remove the intermediate switching that we provide using our tandem switches. When our customers implement direct connects, it reduces the amount of traffic we carry and the revenue we earn. As our customers grow, the amount of traffic exchanged between them grows, thus leading to the risk that they will increase the number of direct connect switch paths that exchange traffic and remove that traffic from our tandems. We believe that the frequency at which our customers are implementing these direct connections is increasing, even in the case of lower traffic volume switch pairs, and we expect this trend to continue in the future, which will cause us to experience a reduction in our revenue. Most importantly, the risk of direct connections is continually increasing as more carriers move to an IP-based interface, because directly connecting between two IP-based carriers at one or only several points is less complex than establishing multiple direct connections between carriers\u2019 switch pairs, thus enabling more direct connections. Many of our largest customers have converted or are rapidly moving to convert their networks to IP, increasing the likelihood of direct connections occurring. Moreover, since these direct connections would connect all or a portion of entire networks, as opposed to switch pairs, the amount of traffic carried over such a direct connection could be significant. In addition, consolidation among telecommunications carriers can stimulate the risk of direct connections by increasing both the incentive for and feasibility of establishing direct connections. For example, we have noticed that certain competitive carriers established direct connections following completion of a business combination. Increased competition from carriers establishing direct connections could result in fewer customer orders, reduced revenues, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. In addition, since direct IP connections could be used to connect all or a portion of entire networks, it increases the likelihood that a customer could use IP connections to connect their entire voice interconnection network to only one or a limited number of vendors. These vendors could then provide all of that customer\u2019s voice interconnection services, as opposed to historically, where a customer may have selected multiple vendors to provide their interconnection services. If an existing customer replaced us with one or a limited number of vendors to provide all of that customer\u2019s interconnection services, it would result in lost revenues, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nA failure to perform under the T-Mobile Agreement could negatively impact our business.\nWe recently announced that we had entered into the T-Mobile Agreement. We carry a substantial volume of traffic on our network as a result of the T-Mobile Agreement. If we fail to perform under the contractual terms of the T-Mobile Agreement or if other events occur and trigger T-Mobile\u2019s right to seek a remedy against us or terminate the T-Mobile Agreement, our business could be negatively impacted. For example, T-Mobile may terminate the T-Mobile Agreement upon (i) the occurrence of an uncured material breach by us; (ii) a material adverse change to us, including if we become insolvent or we take steps toward a bankruptcy\nfiling; (iii) proposed changes in applicable laws that have or will have a material adverse effect on T-Mobile\u2019s use of the services provided by us; (iv) a transaction resulting in a change in our control either (a) with a direct competitor of T-Mobile or (b) that results in a material degradation of the services provided by us; or (v) a force majeure event that continues beyond a designated period. Moreover, if we fail to meet designated service levels for designated periods or on multiple occasions, T-Mobile may also have certain termination rights and the right to receive service credits. If T-Mobile terminates the T-Mobile Agreement or we breach the contractual terms of the agreement, in addition to contract remedies, T-Mobile is generally entitled to all remedies available to it at law or in equity, including, without limitation, monetary damages and equitable relief, under any applicable laws. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nRegulatory developments could negatively impact our business.\nThe communications services industry is extensively regulated by the federal and state governments. As described below, various state regulatory authorities have asserted regulatory authority over the pricing of ILECs\u2019 local transit service, and the FCC is considering whether to adopt price regulation for local transit services at present. Moreover, the FCC has adopted a multi-year plan to reduce and, in many instances, eliminate access charges. The FCC also is considering further changes to its regulations governing access charges. To the extent that transit or access rates are further reduced or capped, it could have an adverse impact on us.\nLocal Tandem Transit Service\nSome state regulatory authorities assert jurisdiction over the provision of local tandem transit services, particularly the ILECs\u2019 provision of the service. Various states have initiated proceedings to examine the regulatory status of transit services. Some states have taken the position that transit service is an element of the \u201ctransport and termination of traffic\u201d services that incumbent ILECs are required to provide at rates based on incremental costs under the Telecommunications Act, while other states have ruled that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 does not apply to these services. For example:\n\u25cf\nA declaratory action was commenced in 2008 with the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control, or the DPUC, pursuant to which a competitive carrier requested that the DPUC order the ILEC to reduce its transit rate to a cost-based rate similar to a rate offered by that ILEC in a different state or to a rate justified in a separate cost proceeding. In 2010, the DPUC ordered the ILEC to implement a new rate based on the ILEC\u2019s costs for transit. The ILEC has made this rate available to all of its customers. We lowered the rate we charge certain of our customers, in some cases substantially, as a result of the DPUC\u2019s ruling, which has had a significant impact on the profitability of our service in Connecticut.\n\u25cf\nIn 2005, the Michigan Public Service Commission revised the maximum allowable rate that AT&T could charge for transit service in Michigan based on AT&T\u2019s total element long run incremental cost, or TELRIC, which was significantly below the rate previously charged by AT&T (previously SBC Communications). This decision caused us to reduce the rate we charged for our transit service and had a significant impact on the profitability of our service in Michigan.\n\u25cf\nIn December 2008, the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska held that the Public Service Commission of Nebraska, or the PSC, was correct in determining that the ILEC must provide transit service under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and that the PSC did not err in ordering the ILEC to provide the service at TELRIC-based rates.\nIf, as a result of any of these proceedings or a different proceeding, the applicable ILEC is required to reduce or limit the rate it charges for local transit service, we would likely be forced to reduce our rate, perhaps substantially, or risk losing customer traffic, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe FCC currently does not regulate the local transit service we offer. However, in 2001, the FCC initiated a proceeding to address intercarrier compensation issues, such as rules that govern the amount that one carrier pays to another carrier for access to the other\u2019s network. In November 2011, the FCC released an intercarrier compensation reform order. That order did not adopt price regulation for local transit service. However, the FCC is currently considering whether to adopt price regulation for local transit service as part of ongoing proceedings. Any changes to the intercarrier compensation rules related to local transit service could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, the FCC could change the pricing of local transit traffic, including lowering the rate, freezing the rate or establishing uniform rates, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, from time to time, carriers with which we connect have requested that we pay them to terminate traffic, and any new rules could address those rights or obligations. If the FCC determines that a terminating carrier has the right to receive payments from us for terminating local transit traffic, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAdditionally, several proposals considered by the FCC in its intercarrier compensation proceeding have contained provisions that indirectly affect local transit traffic. For example, under current law, the originating carrier is typically responsible for paying the\nterminating carrier certain \u201cterminating charges,\u201d such as reciprocal compensation charges, for access to the terminating carrier\u2019s network. As a result, we, as the intermediate transit provider, are not responsible for paying such terminating charges to a terminating carrier in connection with the transit services we offer. Previous proposals submitted to the FCC, however, would require that we, as the transit provider, could be responsible for paying the highest lawful terminating charge to a terminating carrier if the terminating carrier received insufficient information for the terminating carrier to bill the originating carrier for that traffic. These amounts could be significantly larger than the rate we charge for providing the transit service associated with that traffic. Although the previous proposals also would allow us to recover from the originating carrier the same amount that we paid to the terminating carrier, in such an instance we would be faced with credit risks associated with collecting such amounts from the originating carrier, as well as possible disputes with both originating and terminating carriers regarding the appropriate amount due. In this event, if we were unable to recover amounts we paid to a terminating carrier or became involved in distracting and costly disputes with the originating carrier and/or the terminating carrier over the amount due, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, any final order could result in changes to the demand for our services or otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and growth opportunities in a manner that we have not presently identified.\nAccess Services\nWe also provide access services using our tandem switches. Access services are provided as a part of the origination and termination of long distance calls. The FCC regulates interstate access services and the states historically regulate intrastate access services. However, in the November 2011 intercarrier compensation reform order discussed above, the FCC approved reducing and ultimately eliminating both interstate and intrastate terminating access charges.\nIn the order, the FCC capped most access rates as of December 29, 2011. The FCC then required carriers to reduce their intrastate terminating end office rates that exceed the corresponding interstate rates by half of the difference between the rates in July 2012, and reduce those intrastate rates to parity with the interstate rates by July 2013. Following these reductions, the FCC now requires carriers to reduce their termination (and for some carriers also transport) rates to bill-and-keep within six years for price cap carriers, and nine years for rate of return carriers. The FCC has issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking transition for the remaining originating and transport rate elements.\nVarious states are also separately conducting proceedings to determine whether to decrease existing intrastate access charges.\nIf the FCC or any state lowers any access charges that we may charge our customers or we are unable to collect such charges, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or growth opportunities.\nThe telecommunications industry has seen numerous disputes among telephone carriers and other service providers over the extent of the obligation to pay access charges, particularly in cases where VoIP technology is used for all or some of the call transmission. The FCC order described above resolved certain elements of this issue on a prospective basis and holds that VoIP calls will be subject to interstate access charges and/or reciprocal compensation. Certain aspects of the FCC order, however, have led to new disputes, such as the type and cost that may be charged for various elements of a VoIP call. As described above, certain long distance carriers are disputing our right to collect end office access charges for certain types of VoIP traffic. If these new disputes are not timely resolved or are not resolved in our favor or if future rulings establish that we are not able to enforce all or a portion of our access tariffs with respect to VoIP or other types of calls, we could experience a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition, operating results or growth opportunities.\nAs communications technologies and the communications industry continue to evolve, the statutes governing the communications industry or the regulatory policies of the FCC, state legislatures or agencies, or local authorities may change. If this were to occur, including pursuant to any of the proceedings discussed above, the demand and pricing for our services could change in ways that we cannot easily predict and our revenues could materially decline. These risks include the ability of the federal government, including Congress or the FCC, or state legislatures or agencies, or local authorities to:\n\u25cf\nincrease regulatory oversight over the services we provide, including limiting the prices we can charge;\n\u25cf\nadopt or modify statutes, regulations, policies, procedures or programs that are disadvantageous to the services we provide, or that are inconsistent with our current or future plans, or that require modification of the terms of our existing contracts, including reducing the rates for our services;\n\u25cf\nadopt or modify statutes, regulations, policies, procedures or programs in a way that causes changes to our operations or costs or the operations of our customers, including the pricing of our services to our customers;\n\u25cf\nadopt or modify statutes, regulations, policies, procedures or programs in a way that causes a decrease in the amount of traffic our customers exchange with us or causes a change to our customers\u2019 traffic mix, which results in our customers using, on average, lower priced services; or\n\u25cf\nincrease or impose new or additional taxes or surcharges that are disadvantageous to the services we provide or cause a decrease in the amount of traffic our customers deliver to us.\nWe cannot predict when, or upon what terms and conditions, further U.S. federal, state or local regulation or deregulation might occur or the effect future regulation or deregulation may have on our business. The intercarrier compensation reform order released by the FCC in November 2011 was appealed by several parties to a federal appellate court, which upheld the FCC\u2019s framework in all respects. Any of these government actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance at desired pricing levels could impact our ability to maintain profitability or positive cash flow.\nAs a result of competition, the average rates charged for voice services in the United States have decreased significantly over the past several years. We believe that this trend is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.\nIn addition to the regulatory risks that could cause price decreases, the primary sources of pricing pressure include:\n\u25cf\ncompetitors offering our customers services at reduced prices, at times substantially, or bundling and pricing services in a manner that makes it difficult for us to compete. For example, a competing provider of voice transit services might bundle transit with other services, such as inexpensive data or collocation services;\n\u25cf\ncustomers with a significant volume of traffic have in the past and may in the future use their enhanced leverage in pricing negotiations with us. For example, from time to time, customers have requested that we reduce the prices we charge them or they will migrate their traffic to a competitor. Such requests have resulted and may continue to result in lowered pricing or lost traffic, either of which may adversely affect our business; and\n\u25cf\nif our prices are too high, customers may find it economically advantageous to handle certain functions internally, such as exchanging voice traffic, using direct connections instead of using us.\nIf we are unable to offset the effects of any price reductions by carrying higher volumes of traffic, we could experience reduced revenues and gross margins, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur top five customers represent, in the aggregate, a substantial portion of our revenue.\nOur top five customers, in the aggregate, represented approximately 80% of our total revenues from operations during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our two largest customers, AT&T and Verizon, accounted for 31% and 26% respectively, of our total revenues from operations during the year ended December 31, 2015. Certain of these customers have solicited or received proposals from other carriers to provide services that are the same as or similar to ours, and in some cases, have moved traffic to those competitors. In other cases, we have been required to substantially lower the rates we charge our customers to retain their traffic. As discussed in \u201c-We face competition from the traditional ILECs and competition from certain other providers such as AT&T (Long Distance), Verizon Business, Level 3 Communications, Peerless Network and Hypercube, and we expect to compete with new entrants to the voice services market,\u201d competition has intensified over the past several years, and we expect this trend to continue. In addition, our contracts with these customers generally have no volume or exclusivity commitments and any customer is generally able to discontinue the use of all or a portion of our services at any time.\nWe may lose all or a portion of our business with any of these customers or have to reduce the rates we charge if we fail to meet our customers\u2019 expectations, including for performance and other reasons, or if another provider offers to provide the same or similar services at a lower cost. If this occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we terminated 67% of our voice traffic in the United States to five carriers.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenue from services provided in the United States. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we delivered 67% of our traffic in the United States to five carriers. If for any reason we are unable to terminate traffic to any one of these five carriers or a material amount of any terminating traffic to any other carrier(s), we would be unable to generate revenue from our customer originating the calls to such terminating carriers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects,\nfinancial condition and operating results. Moreover, if any carrier refuses to accept traffic or conditions receipt on terms that are not favorable to us, regardless of what we believe is their legal obligation to do so, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating result. See \u201c-Carriers may refuse to directly interconnect with us and consequently, we would be unable to terminate our customers\u2019 traffic to them.\u201d In 2012, we agreed to pay a carrier a significant amount to terminate certain long distance traffic to it. This agreement negatively affected our business.\nCarriers may refuse to directly interconnect with us and consequently, we would be unable to terminate our customers\u2019 traffic to them.\nBy operating as a voice common carrier, we benefit from certain legal rights established by federal and state statutes. We have used these rights to gain interconnection with the incumbent telephone companies. We have also used these rights to request interconnection with competitive carriers for the termination of traffic to carriers that decide for whatever reason not to utilize our service. While our experience has been that competitive carriers usually accommodate such requests, we have been involved in various state and federal regulatory proceedings against Level 3 and Verizon Wireless related to their refusal to continue to accept terminating local transit traffic. We entered into agreements resolving these disputes in 2008. If, however, any carrier in the future refuses to accept either access or local transit traffic over a direct connection or otherwise seeks to limit or condition our ability to terminate traffic on terms that are not favorable to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, even though we believe that we have the legal right to exchange traffic with carriers under reasonable terms and may seek to enforce that right in legal or regulatory proceedings, there can be no assurance that we would prevail. Our efforts in any such proceedings or responding to other actions could have an adverse impact on us, regardless of whether or not we prevail, due to legal costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nSecurity breaches could adversely affect our business and our customers\u2019 confidential information or personal data, which could result in us being subject to legal liability and our reputation could be harmed.\nOur network equipment and facilities may be vulnerable to cybercrime, such as physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers or similar disruptive problems. If unauthorized users gain access to our switch sites, network equipment or facilities or our databases, it could result in an interruption of service or reduced quality of service, which could cause harm to our business and reputation and could result in a loss of customers. Such a breach of security could also relate to the disclosure or theft of our customers\u2019 confidential information or personal data, which could result in legal liability to us and a reduction in use of our services or cancellation of our services, either of which could materially harm our business. Our personnel often receive highly confidential information from our customers that is stored in our files and on our systems. Similarly, we receive sensitive information that has historically been maintained as a matter of confidence with our customers.\nWe currently have procedures in place to ensure the integrity of our networks, support systems, and the confidentiality of our customers\u2019 information. However, our procedures to protect against the risk of inadvertent disclosure or breaches of security might fail to protect adequately our systems or the information that we are obligated to keep confidential. Additionally, we may not successfully adopt more effective systems for maintaining confidential information, so our exposure to the risk of disclosure of the confidential information of our customers may grow as we expand our business and increase the amount of information that we possess. If we fail to maintain adequately our customers\u2019 confidential information, some of our customers could end their business relationships with us and we could be subject to legal liability.\nIf we are unable to obtain approval of any tariff, or any provision of a tariff is held to be invalid or suspended, we could be unable to enforce the relevant provisions of the tariff, including the right to collect money for delivered services.\nWe provide certain services, principally switched access services, pursuant to tariffs we have filed with the FCC and those states in which we operate. These tariffs essentially form the binding legal agreement under which we provide these services to certain customers, and include terms setting forth the pricing for the services, our right to collect amounts charged, and other customary terms related to the provision of the services, including provisions that limit our liability if we fail to properly provide a service. If we are unable to obtain approval of a tariff, or if a tariff is approved but it is later determined that a provision is invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such a determination could affect our ability to collect fees for any service we have provided or require us to refund payments previously received. Moreover, if a customer is able to show that we did not provide services in the manner described in our tariff, that could also affect our ability to collect fees for any service we have provided or require us to refund payments previously received. Any of the foregoing, or any other determination that a tariff provision is invalid or unenforceable, could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nFailures or interruptions of our network and other network facilities or the loss of, or damage to, a network switch site or other network facilities could materially harm our revenues and impair our ability to conduct our operations.\nOur network architecture is integral to our ability to process a high volume of traffic in a timely, reliable and effective manner. We could experience failures or interruptions of our network and services, or other problems in connection with our operations, as a result of:\n\u25cf\ndamage to, or failure of, our network software or hardware or our connections and outsourced service arrangements with third parties, similar to the failures in our signaling network we experienced in 2012 and 2014, which resulted in an outage of our network and services;\n\u25cf\nerrors in the processing of data by our systems;\n\u25cf\ncomputer viruses or software defects or failures;\n\u25cf\nphysical or electronic break-ins (hacking or cybercrime), sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorism, natural disasters and similar events;\n\u25cf\nincreased capacity demands or changes in systems requirements of our customers;\n\u25cf\nprovisioning, installing and delivering these services; and\n\u25cf\nerrors by our employees or third-party service providers.\nIf we cannot adequately protect the ability of our network to perform consistently at a high level or otherwise fail to meet our customers\u2019 expectations:\n\u25cf\nwe may be unable to provide and collect revenue for services;\n\u25cf\nwe may be unable to bill properly and collect for services provided;\n\u25cf\nwe may experience damage to our reputation, which may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain customers for our existing services, and may also make it more difficult for us to market new services;\n\u25cf\nwe may be subject to significant damages claims, under our contracts or otherwise;\n\u25cf\nour operating expenses or capital expenditures may increase as a result of corrective efforts that we must perform;\n\u25cf\nour customers may postpone or cancel subsequently scheduled work or reduce their use of our services; or\n\u25cf\none or more of our significant contracts may be terminated early, or may not be renewed.\nAny of these consequences would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not have sufficient redundant systems or backup facilities to allow us to receive and process traffic in the event of a loss of, or damage to, a network switch site or other network facilities. We could lose, or suffer damage to, a site in the event of power loss, natural disasters such as fires, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and tornadoes, telecommunications failures, such as transmission cable cuts, or other similar events that could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to access our services. Further, widespread business closings or failures or interruptions in telecommunications services of other carriers as a result of power loss, natural disasters, telecommunications failures and other similar events, may result in a reduction of in the volume of services we provide. Any such events could interrupt our operations, materially harm our revenues and growth and require significant cash expenditures to correct the issues caused by such loss or damage.\nWe may be unable to complete suitable acquisitions, or we may undertake acquisitions that could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive to our business.\nIn the future, we may selectively pursue acquisitions to grow our business. We do not currently have any commitments, contracts or understandings to acquire any specific businesses or other material operations. We may not be able to locate suitable acquisition candidates at prices that we consider appropriate or to finance acquisitions on terms that are satisfactory to us. See \u201c-We may be unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing to execute our business plan and, if additional financing is not available, we may need to limit, scale-back or cease our operations.\u201d If we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully negotiate the terms of an acquisition, finance the acquisition or, if the acquisition occurs, integrate the acquired business into our existing business. See \u201c-Business acquisitions that we may explore in the future will be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.\u201d\nBusiness acquisitions that we may explore in the future will be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.\nThe integration of any future businesses that we may acquire involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\ndemands on management related to the increase in size of our operations after an acquisition;\n\u25cf\nfailure to fully achieve expected synergies and costs savings;\n\u25cf\nloss of customers or the failure of customers to order incremental services that we expect them to order;\n\u25cf\nhigher integration costs than anticipated;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in the assimilation and retention of highly qualified and experienced employees;\n\u25cf\nthe disruption of ongoing business and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from managing daily operations to managing integration activities, which may require coordinating organizations utilizing systems which may not be fully compatible, integrating and retaining personnel with disparate business backgrounds, and combining different corporate cultures;\n\u25cf\nfailure to anticipate the costs related to accounting and tax matters resulting from the acquisition of a business, including with respect to the costs of hiring employees and professional consultants to comply with accounting and tax matters, as well as the payment of taxes imposed by various taxing authorities and disputes and audits related thereto;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated impediments in the integration of departments, systems, including accounting systems, technologies, books and records and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, controls (including internal control over financial reporting required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), procedures and policies; and\n\u25cf\nfailure to provision services that are ordered by customers during the integration period.\nSuccessful integration of any future acquired businesses or operations will depend on our ability to manage these operations, realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by strengthened service offerings and expanded geographic market coverage, obtain better terms from our vendors due to increased buying power, and eliminate redundant and excess costs to fully realize the expected synergies. Because of difficulties in combining operations and systems which may not be fully compatible, we may not be able to achieve the financial benefits and growth we anticipate from the acquisitions.\nIn addition, acquisitions of businesses or other material operations may reduce our liquidity and capital resources and may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in reduced financial resources, additional leverage or dilution of ownership. We may also need to record write-downs from future impairments of intangible assets, which could reduce our future reported earnings. At times, acquisition candidates may have liabilities, neutrality-related risks or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through due diligence prior to the acquisition.\nOur business requires the continued development of effective business support systems to implement customer orders, provide and bill for services, and pay for services we receive from our vendors.\nOur business depends on our ability to continue to develop effective business support systems. This can be a complicated undertaking that requires significant resources and expertise and support from third-party vendors. Business support systems are needed for:\n\u25cf\nordering services from our vendors and verifying that we are being charged the correct amount;\n\u25cf\nquoting, accepting and inputting customer orders for services;\n\u25cf\nprovisioning, installing and delivering these services;\n\u25cf\nmonitoring the types of traffic carried over our network to determine profitability; and\n\u25cf\nbilling for these services.\nBecause our business plans provide for continued growth in the number of customers that we serve and the volume of services offered as well as the potential integration of other acquired companies\u2019 business support systems, there is a need to continue to develop our business support systems on a timely basis. The failure to continue to develop effective business support systems could affect our ability to implement our business plans or to realize anticipated benefits from potential acquisitions and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth strategy, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have selectively offered new services, such as 8XX toll free, international voice and DID services. For a further description of our services see \u201cBusiness-Our Services.\u201d Although the revenue currently associated with our DID and international services are not substantial, we view the development and provision of new service to be a critical component of our growth strategy.\nWe will face various risks associated with providing any new services, including risks relating to identifying, obtaining and integrating attractive network switch sites and suitable equipment or software, customer demand failing to materialize as projected, cost estimation errors or overruns, interconnection delays, material delays or shortages, our inability to obtain necessary permits on a timely basis, if at all, and other factors, including the impact of regulation, many of which are beyond our control and all of which could delay our expansion into new markets or ability to offer new services. We may not be able to enter new markets or offer new services on a timely or profitable basis, if at all. Furthermore, revenues from our growth initiatives may be lower than anticipated. In addition, entering new markets and offering new services will increase our operating expenses, including lease expenses, expenses associated with hiring, training, retaining and managing new employees, purchasing new equipment, developing and implementing new systems, complying with regulatory, tax and accounting requirements, and incurring additional depreciation expense. Furthermore, as our growth initiatives are implemented, we will be exposed to increased risks if we conduct any operations outside of the United States, including currency exchange rate fluctuations, trade protection measures, difficulty in staffing, training and managing foreign operations, political and economic instability and diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the United States.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage our growth strategy, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nConsolidation in the industry, such as AT&T-BellSouth-Cingular, Verizon-MCI, SBC-AT&T, and T-Mobile-MetroPCS reduces the need for intercarrier services and may limit our growth opportunities.\nConsolidation in the industry reduces the need for intercarrier services by reducing the number of carriers. As carriers merge, (i) the risks to our business of direct connections increases, see \u201c-The market for our services is competitive and increased adoption of IP switching technologies could increase the competition we face from direct connections or result in an existing customer replacing us with one or a limited number of vendors to provide all of that customer\u2019s voice interconnection services,\u201d (ii) traffic that was carrier-to-carrier becomes intra-carrier traffic not normally addressable by us and (iii) in the case of consolidations involving an ILEC, such as AT&T or Verizon, previous transit traffic between competitive carriers and the carrier acquired by the ILEC now potentially becomes ILEC reciprocal compensation traffic and not transit traffic, and thus potentially not addressable by us. For example, as a result of the SBC-AT&T combination, beginning in the second quarter of 2006, the combined SBC and AT&T entity began reducing the amount of minutes of use processed by us. During our 2006 fiscal year, we processed approximately 55% fewer minutes from AT&T and SBC, as a combined entity, compared to our 2005 fiscal year. We have experienced growth notwithstanding this consolidation, but our ability to grow in the future could be affected by greater consolidation. .\nFurther, in connection with the 2006 merger of BellSouth Corp., or BellSouth, and AT&T, AT&T agreed not to seek an increase in its current local transit rates for existing transit customers for 42 months in the AT&T and BellSouth ILEC service territories. While having no direct regulatory impact on us, such an agreement indirectly limited the rates we could charge for our transit service. Further consolidation in the industry could lead to similar agreements in the future which would limit our ability to grow revenues and may materially affect our operating results.\nIf we are not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for our methods and technologies, competitors may be more easily able to compete with us.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop under the patent and other intellectual property laws of the United States, so that we can prevent others from using our inventions and proprietary information. However, we may not hold proprietary rights to some of our current or future methods and technologies. Because patent applications in the United States are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of discoveries in industry-related literature lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in issued patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in our patent applications. As a result, we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection and competitors would be more easily able to compete with us.\nThe process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may be able to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. The issuance of a patent does not guarantee that it is valid or enforceable, so even if we obtain patents, they may not be valid or enforceable against third parties. In addition, the issuance of a patent does not guarantee that we have the right to practice the patented invention. Third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from marketing our own patented product and practicing our own patented technology.\nOur pending patent applications may not result in issued patents. The patent position of technology-oriented companies, including ours, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual considerations. The standards which the United States Patent and Trademark Office use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. Accordingly, we do not know the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights or the breadth of claims allowed in any patents issued to us or to others. The allowance of broader claims may increase the incidence and cost of patent interference proceedings and/or opposition proceedings and the risk of such claims being invalidated by infringement litigation. On the other hand, the allowance of narrower claims may limit the value of our proprietary rights. Our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products, or provide us with any competitive advantage. Moreover, once any patents have been issued, our patents and any patent for which we have licensed or may license rights may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. If our patents are invalidated or otherwise limited, other companies will be better able to develop products that compete with ours, which could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition.\nWe previously engaged in patent litigation in which we did not prevail. On June 12, 2008, we commenced a patent infringement action against Peerless Network, Inc. and John Barnicle in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois to enforce our rights under a patent referred to as the \u2018708 Patent (Neutral Tandem, Inc. v Peerless Network, Inc., Peerless Network of Illinois, LLC and John Barnicle, 08 CV 3402). On September 2, 2010, the court hearing the case granted Peerless Network\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court found that the \u2019708 Patent was invalid in light of a prior patent. On December 13, 2011, the federal appellate court affirmed the finding that our patent is invalid, and on January 30, 2012, the appellate court denied our petition for rehearing of the December 13, 2011 ruling. We elected not to appeal this ruling. As a result, the district court\u2019s ruling that the \u2018708 Patent is invalid became final and non-appealable.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, know-how and technology, which are not protected by patents, to maintain our competitive position. If any trade secret, know-how or other technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe provide communications services in a rapidly evolving market. If we are unable to overcome the difficulties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets, our business could be materially harmed.\nWe began our operations in February 2004. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, risks and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets. This includes developing new services, as we now provide our existing services in virtually all of the major and mid-size U.S. markets to most of the medium-sized and largest carriers. In order to overcome these risks and difficulties, we must, among other things:\n\u25cf\ngenerate sufficient usage of our network by our customers;\n\u25cf\nmaintain and attract a sufficient number of customers to our network to achieve and sustain profitability;\n\u25cf\nexecute our business strategy successfully, including successful development and provision of new services and integration of acquired operations;\n\u25cf\nmanage our expanding operations; and\n\u25cf\nupgrade our technology, systems and network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic volume and to implement new features and functions.\nOur failure to overcome these risks and difficulties and the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by new companies in rapidly evolving markets could adversely affect our operating results which could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business or continue our operations.\nEconomic conditions could cause a material reduction in the amount of traffic we carry on our network.\nWe generate the majority of our revenue by charging carriers on a per minute of use basis for the traffic we carry on our network. If weakening economic conditions result in decreased spending on telecommunications services (or a decrease in the\nsubscriber base at our customers), the amount of traffic we carry on our network on behalf of our customers could decrease. Furthermore, financial pressure faced by our customers could result in mergers, acquisitions, liquidations or divestitures of all or a portion of our customers\u2019 businesses, which in turn could result in a reduction in the use of our services. See \u201c-Consolidation in the industry, such as AT&T-BellSouth-Cingular, Verizon-MCI, SBC-AT&T, and T-Mobile-MetroPCS reduces the need for intercarrier services and may limit our growth opportunities.\u201d A reduction from these or other economic-related causes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe could experience material variances in our revenues due to events outside of our control.\nWe could experience material variances in our revenues due to events both under and outside of our control. For example, we could experience a material decline in the traffic that we process due to holidays or other seasonal variability, the timing of direct connects established between our customers, competitors offering services at reduced rates, installation delays, the implementation of routing changes and traffic outages. If one or more of these events occur, especially with respect to one or more of our larger customers, it could cause a material decrease in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur ability to sell our services depends in part on the quality of our support and service offerings, and our failure to offer high-quality support and services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results.\nOnce our services are deployed, our customers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues. A high level of support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our services. If we do not effectively assist carriers in deploying our services, succeed in helping carriers quickly resolve post-deployment issues and provide effective ongoing support, it will adversely affect our ability to retain those customers or sell additional services. In addition, if we complete acquisitions, enter new geographic territories or expand our service offerings, it may become more difficult for us to provide these support services. As a result, our failure to maintain high-quality support and services would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. See \u201c-Our business requires the continued development of effective business support systems to implement customer orders, provide and bill for services, and pay for services we receive from our vendors.\u201d\nThe failure of the third-party software and equipment we use in providing our voice services could cause interruptions or failures of our systems.\nWe incorporate hardware, software and equipment and license technologies developed by third parties in providing our voice services. Our third-party vendors include, among others, Cisco and Oracle for our database systems and software, and numerous network services suppliers, such as AT&T, Verizon, CenturyLink, Level 3 and Transaction Network Services, for our transport and Signaling System 7 services. As a result, our ability to provide services depends in part on the continued performance and support of the third-party services and products on which we rely and the respective vendors\u2019 rights to license services and products to us, including without any third-party claims for intellectual property infringement. If any third-party services, equipment or products are not provided to us or experience failures or have defects, or the third parties that supply the services, equipment or products fail to provide adequate support due to financial problems they face or for any other reason, this could result in or exacerbate an interruption or failure of our systems or services. Any such failure or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results and expose us to claims by customers.\nOur business could be harmed by prolonged electrical power outages or shortages, increased costs of energy or general availability of electrical resources.\nOur network switch sites are susceptible to regional costs of power, electrical power shortages, planned or unplanned power outages caused by these shortages, such as those that occurred in the northeast region of the United States in 2003, in the southeast region of the United States in 2005, and in the New York area from Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and limitations of adequate power resources. Power outages, which last beyond our backup and alternative power arrangements, could reduce our revenue and otherwise harm our business and expose us to claims by customers. Moreover, we may not be able to pass on to our customers significant increases in the cost of power we obtain.\nWe generally do not have minimum revenue requirements in our contracts, which means that our customers could cease or reduce their usage of our services at any time and without notice.\nWe earn revenues for the majority of the services that we provide on a per minute of use basis. We generally do not have minimum revenue or exclusivity requirements in our contracts, which means that our customers could cease or reduce their usage of our services from their current levels at any time and without notice or penalty. If this were to occur, our revenues and results of\noperations will immediately suffer because there is no contractual requirement for the purchase of our services. For example, as discussed above, certain of our customers have migrated voice services to a competitor that has been offering our customers lower pricing in certain of our largest and other markets. See \u201c-We face competition from the traditional ILECs and competition from certain other providers such as AT&T (Long Distance), Verizon Business, Level 3 Communications, Peerless Network and Hypercube, and we expect to compete with new entrants to the voice services market.\u201d If one or more of our larger customers cease or reduce the use of our services, we will experience a reduction in the volume of services we provide, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nFailure to comply with neutrality positioning could result in loss of significant business.\nWe have positioned ourselves as a neutral third-party provider of services (that is, we generally do not compete with our customers in any of their core businesses). Our failure to continue to adhere to this neutrality positioning may result in lost sales or non-renewal of contracts, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. For example, we provide national transit services and tandem access services in the United States, each of which are long distance voice services, and both of which can be viewed by some of our customers as being competitive with certain of the voice services they provide.\nOur senior management is important to our customer relationships, and the loss of one or more of our senior managers could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe believe that our success depends in part on the continued contributions of our senior management. We rely on our executive officers and senior management to generate business and execute programs successfully. In addition, the relationships and reputation that members of our management team have established and maintain with our customers and our regulators contribute to our ability to maintain good customer relations and affect regulatory changes. The loss of one or more key members of senior management could impair our ability to identify and secure new contracts and otherwise to manage our business, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe must recruit and retain skilled employees to succeed in our business.\nWe believe that an integral part of our success is our ability to recruit and retain employees who have advanced skills related to the services that we provide or plan to provide and who work well with our customers in the regulated environment in which we operate. In particular, we must hire and retain employees with the technical expertise and industry knowledge necessary to maintain and continue to develop our operations and effectively manage our growing sales and marketing organization to ensure the development of new services and growth of our operations. Our future success depends on the ability of our sales and marketing organization to establish direct sales and to develop new services. The employees with the technical and other skills we require are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource in the foreseeable future. If we are unable to recruit and retain a sufficient number of these employees at all levels, our ability to maintain and grow our business could be negatively impacted.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing to execute our business plan and, if additional financing is not available, we may need to limit, scale-back or cease our operations.\nWe expect to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months through a combination of cash flow from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. In addition, we currently maintain $15 million revolving credit facility with Bank of Montreal. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no amounts were drawn on this facility. If our cash requirements vary materially from those currently planned, or if we fail to generate sufficient cash flow from our business, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated. Additional equity or debt financing may result in the incurrence of additional leverage or dilution to our stockholders.\nIn addition, we may seek additional funding in the future through public or private equity and debt financings including in connection with any future acquisitions. Additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may not be able to execute our business plan and could face the following or other risks:\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to expand or acquire complementary businesses;\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to continue to meet customer demand for service quality, availability and competitive pricing;\n\u25cf\nwe may be forced to reduce our operations;\n\u25cf\nwe may be forced to reduce our headcount;\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to develop new services or otherwise respond to changing business conditions or competitive pressures; and\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to adequately maintain or upgrade our systems and technology.\nAs a result, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected and we may be required to significantly curtail or cease our operations.\nIf we do not adapt to rapid technological change in the communications industry, we could lose customers or market share.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new service offerings. Significant technological changes could make our technology and services obsolete, too costly or inefficient on a relative basis. We must adapt to our rapidly changing market by continually improving the features, functionality, reliability and responsiveness of our services to meet changing customer needs. We cannot ensure that we will be able to adapt to these challenges or respond successfully or in a cost-effective way. Our failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to compete and retain customers or market share. Many existing and emerging companies are providing, or propose to provide, competing services using new technologies. Furthermore, the increased adoption of IP switching technologies could increase the competition we face from direct connections. See \u201c-The market for our services is competitive and increased adoption of IP switching technologies could increase the competition we face from direct connections or result in an existing customer replacing us with one or a limited number of vendors to provide all of that customer\u2019s voice interconnection services.\u201d Our future revenues and profits will depend on our ability to provide value added service(s) to competitive carriers. If we are unable to provide these service(s), whether as a result of technology changes or otherwise, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nIn order to protect our proprietary technology, processes and methods, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants, advisors and others. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases we could not assert any rights against such party. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nOthers may allege that we are infringing upon their intellectual property, forcing us to expend substantial resources in resulting litigation, the outcome of which would be uncertain. Any unfavorable outcome of such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results.\nIf any parties successfully claim that our creation, offer for sale, sale, import or use of technologies infringes upon their intellectual property rights, we might be forced to incur expenses to litigate the claims, pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed such parties\u2019 patents or copyrights. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in litigation, a court could issue a permanent injunction preventing us from operating our network, offering our services or using certain of our systems for the life of the patent that we have been deemed to have infringed. Litigation concerning patents and other forms of intellectual property and proprietary technologies, is becoming more widespread and can be protracted and expensive, and can distract management and other key personnel from performing their duties for us.\nAny legal action against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to the affected methods, processes, products and services could, in addition to subjecting us to potential liability for damages, require us to obtain a license in order to continue to operate our network, use the affected systems or market the affected services. Any license required under any patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, some licenses may be nonexclusive, and therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent, we may be unable to effectively operate our network or market some of our technology and products, which could limit our ability to generate revenues or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations.\nFrom time to time we have received and we may in the future receive notices or inquiries from other companies regarding our services or the manner in which we operate our network suggesting that we may be infringing a pre-existing patent or we need to license use of their patents to avoid infringement. Such notices may, among other things, threaten litigation against us. As we have in the past, we will actively review the request and determine whether there is any validity to the request and seek to resolve the matter. Litigation over patent rights and other intellectual property rights is not uncommon with respect to network technologies, and sometimes involves patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenues and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence. There can be no assurance that holders of patents will not pursue any claim against us in the future if they believe their patents are being infringed by our network or service offerings.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is likely to be volatile.\nOur stock price is likely to be volatile. The market prices for securities of telecommunications companies have historically been volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u25cf\nthe passage of various laws and governmental regulations governing communications-related services and Internet-related services;\n\u25cf\na decrease in our cash position;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our dividend practice;\n\u25cf\na decrease in the amount of traffic we carry or the rates we charge for such traffic, whether from competition , the termination of customer agreements or otherwise;\n\u25cf\nthe failure to develop new services or successfully manage our growth strategy;\n\u25cf\nthe failure of or disruption to our physical infrastructure or services;\n\u25cf\nconditions or trends in the Internet, technology and communications industries;\n\u25cf\nthe addition or departure of any key employees;\n\u25cf\nthe level and quality of securities research analyst coverage of our common stock;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the estimates of our operating performance or changes in recommendations of us by any research analyst that follow our stock or any failure to meet the estimates made by research analysts;\n\u25cf\nlitigation involving ourselves, our granted or any future patents, or our general industry or both;\n\u25cf\ninvestors\u2019 general perception of us, our services, the economy and general market conditions;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments or disputes concerning third party patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf\nthe announcement of significant acquisitions, divestitures, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors; and\n\u25cf\nother factors discussed within these \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nIf any of these factors cause an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition, the price of our common stock could fall. In addition, public announcements by our competitors regarding, among other things, their performance, strategy, accounting practices, or legal problems could cause the price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance.\nA reduction in our cash position or changes in our capital structure, including our level of indebtedness and the terms of such indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position.\nA reduction in our cash balance may adversely affect our ability to operate and expand our business.\nWe previously entered into a $15 million revolving credit facility and have no plans to draw on the facility at this time. We may incur additional debt in the future or increase our level of indebtedness from time to time for various reasons, including fluctuations in operating results, capital expenditures and possible acquisitions. Future consolidated indebtedness levels could materially affect our business by:\n\u25cf\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to interest payments on such indebtedness, and thereby not available for other purposes;\n\u25cf\nmaterially limiting or impairing our ability to obtain further financing;\n\u25cf\nreducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise; and\n\u25cf\nfurther limiting our ability to pay dividends.\nIn addition, any credit agreement may limit our ability to enter into various transactions. If we were to default on any of our debt obligations, or if we were unable to obtain necessary liquidity, our obligation to repay such debt would become due and payable immediately and our business could be adversely affected.\nA substantial portion of our cash at December 31, 2015 was invested in three money market funds.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $86.9 million invested in three money market funds. Due to the short duration of the cash invested, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our cash investments as a result of changes in interest rates. However, since the share price of a money market fund is typically $1, the interest rate paid on the investment or the yield, is typically the predominant measure of the return we receive. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks that could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Failure to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\nIn 2013, we initiated the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Our ability to pay quarterly cash dividends will be subject to, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, any indebtedness we may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law, tax considerations and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend in the future. Any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Moreover, in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends is reduced or discontinued, our failure or inability to resume paying quarterly cash dividends at historical levels could result in a lower market valuation of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions under Delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws currently:\n\u25cf\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u25cf\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of the stock to elect some directors;\n\u25cf\nrequire that directors only be removed from office for cause and by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2 / 3 % of the total votes eligible to be cast in the election of directors;\n\u25cf\nrequire that vacancies on the Board of Directors, including newly created directorships, be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u25cf\nlimit who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u25cf\nauthorize the issuance of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock without stockholder approval, subject to the rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Stock Market;\n\u25cf\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and\n\u25cf\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters.\nOn February 9, 2016, the Board of Directors proposed and declared advisable an amendment to our certificate of incorporation, consistent with Section 141(k) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, to remove the words \u201cfor cause\u201d so that any of our directors can be removed, with or without cause. The Board of Directors directed that such amendment be proposed at our next annual meeting of stockholders. Consistent therewith, and in light of a recent ruling by the Delaware Chancery court, we will not attempt to enforce the \u201conly for-cause\u201d director removal provision.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us. Section 203 regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 15% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock. Under Delaware law a corporation may opt out of the anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so.\nThese provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.", "PERMNO": 92454, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "IQNT"}
