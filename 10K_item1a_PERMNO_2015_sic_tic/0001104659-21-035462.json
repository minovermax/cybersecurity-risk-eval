{"cik": "106532", "company": "WEYCO GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nThere are various factors that affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The following is a description of some of the material factors that might materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputations, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisk factors related to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition have been, and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the effects of widespread public health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, that are beyond its control.\nOutbreaks of infectious diseases, public health epidemics and other adverse public health developments in countries where the Company, its customers and its suppliers operate have, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. The worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely impacted, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, the Company\u2019s business. The nature and extent of the impact, including the effects on the global economy, are highly uncertain and beyond the Company\u2019s control. Uncertain factors relating to the COVID-19 pandemic include the duration, spread and severity of the virus, as well as the effectiveness of vaccines, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s customers, vendors and suppliers, including any future bankruptcies of such parties. In addition, other factors include the actions, or perception of actions that may be taken, to contain or treat its impact, including declarations of states of emergency, business closures, manufacturing restrictions and a prolonged period of travel, commercial and/or other similar restrictions and limitations, including stay-at-home and similar orders.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures designed to contain its spread, the Company\u2019s sales have been, and are expected to continue to be, negatively impacted as a result of disruption in demand and changes in customer purchasing behaviors, as well as reduced foot traffic, which have had, and are expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to the economic impact of the pandemic, collection of accounts receivable has slowed, and the Company expects that trend to continue into 2021. The Company wrote off a net $4.3 million of receivables during 2020 due to bankruptcy filings by two large customers. While the Company endeavors to actively manage receivables to secure payments and mitigate risk, and also monitors the financial health of its other customers, due to the pandemic or its related impact, additional customers could be in financial distress, which could cause the Company to experience other write-downs. The Company has reduced operating expenses where appropriate and continues to scrutinize its costs in light of decreased demand.\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company and macroeconomic conditions, the Company conducted impairment assessments of its goodwill and trademarks at each quarterly interim period in 2020, and again at December 31, 2020. While the results did not indicate that such assets were impaired, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have adverse effects on the Company and the global economy for an extended period, the Company could recognize impairment in a future period. There have been some disruptions in the Company\u2019s supply chain as a result of the pandemic however, the Company\u2019s distribution center and supply chain are currently fully operational. Additional disruptions may occur in the Company\u2019s supply chain as a result of facility closures, worker absenteeism, quarantines or other travel or health-related restrictions, which could delay the production of its products. The duration of the disruption to the Company\u2019s customers and to its supply chain, and related financial impact, cannot be estimated at this time. Should such disruption continue for an extended period of time, the impact could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisk factors related to our business and industry\nDecreases in disposable income and general market volatility in the U.S. and global economy may adversely affect the Company.\nSpending patterns in the footwear market, particularly those in the moderate-priced market in which a majority of the Company\u2019s products compete, have historically been correlated with consumers\u2019 disposable income. As a result, the success of the Company is affected by changes in general economic conditions, especially in the United States. Factors affecting discretionary income for the moderate consumer include, among others, general business conditions, gas and energy costs, employment rates, consumer confidence, interest rates and taxation. Additionally, the economy and consumer behavior generally impact the financial strength and buying patterns of retailers, which can also affect the Company\u2019s results. Volatile, unstable or weak economic conditions, or a worsening of conditions, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales volume and overall performance.\nThe Company is subject to risks related to operating in the retail environment that could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with doing business in the retail environment, primarily in the United States. The U.S. retail industry has experienced a growing trend toward consolidation of large retailers. The merger of additional major retailers could result in the Company losing sales volume or increasing its concentration of business with a few large accounts, resulting in reduced bargaining power, which could increase pricing pressures and lower the Company\u2019s margins.\nThe Company regularly assesses its retail locations in the U.S. and overseas and, at times, including during fiscal 2020, has closed unprofitable retail locations and incurred costs related to such closures. Future closures could have a material adverse effect on results.\nAs the popularity of online shopping for consumer goods continues to increase, the Company\u2019s retail partners in the U.S. and abroad may experience decreased foot traffic, which could negatively impact their businesses. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has led, and is expected to continue to cause, a decrease in foot traffic; other significant health pandemic or outbreaks of infectious diseases could also lead to a similar decrease in foot traffic. Decreases in foot traffic have, and in the future may, in turn, negatively impact the Company\u2019s sales to those customers, and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. As noted above, the bankruptcies of two large customers during 2020 led to write offs of a net $4.3 million of receivables during 2020. The future bankruptcy of any of the Company\u2019s major retail partners would also negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive environment, which may result in lower prices and reduced profits.\nThe footwear market is extremely competitive. The Company competes with numerous manufacturers, distributors and retailers of men\u2019s, women\u2019s and children\u2019s shoes, some of which are larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company. The Company competes with these companies primarily on the basis of price, quality, service and brand recognition, all of which are important competitive factors in the shoe industry. The Company\u2019s ability to maintain its competitive edge depends upon these factors, as well as its ability to deliver new products at the best value for the consumer, maintain positive brand recognition, and obtain sufficient retail floor space and effective product presentation at retail. If the Company does not remain competitive, future prospects, results of operations and financial condition could decline.\nChanges in fashion trends and consumer preferences could negatively impact the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s success is dependent upon its ability to accurately anticipate and respond to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, purchases of dress and other dress-casual footwear were negatively affected as many consumers worked from home due to stay-at-home orders or otherwise, and social as well as other occasion-related events were cancelled. Failure to predict or effectively respond to trends or preferences could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s sales volume and overall performance, as well as have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company conducts business globally, which exposes it to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations as well as political, economic and social risks.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, with its primary exposures being to the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. The Company is therefore subject to foreign currency risks and foreign exchange exposure. Exchange rates can be volatile and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company is exposed to other risks of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, including political, economic or social instability, acts of terrorism, civil unrest, changes in government policies and regulations, outbreaks of infectious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), severe weather events, natural disasters, and exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption laws (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act). The Company is also exposed to risks relating to U.S. policy with respect to companies doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Additional legislation or other changes in the U.S. tax laws or interpretations could increase the Company\u2019s U.S. income tax liability and adversely affect the Company\u2019s after-tax profitability. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the United Kingdom\u2019s (UK) exit from European Union (EU) membership has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty. Although negotiations continue between the UK and EU, it is currently unknown what the terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s future relationship with the EU will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and EU and increased regulatory complexities. Any of these factors could adversely impact customer demand, the Company\u2019s relationships with customers and suppliers and its results of operations.\nRisk factors related to our operations\nThe Company relies on independent foreign sources of production and the availability of leather, rubber and other raw materials; a deterioration in the Company\u2019s relationship with, or other issues affecting, such manufacturers and/or issues with the availability of raw materials could have unfavorable effects on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company purchases all of its products from independent foreign manufacturers, primarily in China and India. Although the Company believes that it has good working relationships with its manufacturers, the Company does not have long-term contracts with them. Thus, the Company could experience increases in manufacturing costs, disruptions in the timely supply of products or unanticipated reductions in manufacturing capacity, any of which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company has the ability to move production to different suppliers; however, the transition may not occur smoothly or quickly, which could result in the Company missing customer delivery date requirements and, consequently, the Company could lose future orders and its reputation may be harmed.\nThe Company\u2019s use of foreign sources of production results in relatively long production and delivery lead times. Therefore, the Company typically forecasts demand at least five months in advance. If the Company\u2019s forecasts are wrong or there are significant changes in demand, it would result in a loss of sales if the Company does not have enough product on hand or in reduced margins if the Company has excess inventory that needs to be sold at discounted prices.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may be affected by disruptions at U.S. or foreign ports or other transportation facilities, such as those due to labor disputes and work stoppages, political unrest, trade protection measures or trade wars, severe weather (climate change may increase the frequency and severity of severe weather conditions or events), outbreaks of infectious diseases, or security requirements in the United States and other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to its customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transportation costs, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s overall profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s products depend on the availability of raw materials, especially leather and rubber. Any significant shortages of quantities or increases in the cost of leather or rubber would have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations, unless the Company was able to pass such costs along to its customers.\nAdditional risks associated with foreign sourcing that could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business include adverse changes in foreign economic conditions, import regulations, restrictions on the transfer of funds, duties, tariffs, quotas and political or labor interruptions, foreign currency fluctuations, expropriation and nationalization. For example, beginning in 2019, an additional tariff was imposed on leather footwear exported from China, where the Company sources a significant portion of its products. Although this tariff did not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations due to various mitigation efforts, the imposition of additional tariffs on the Company\u2019s products could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s future results of operations.\nLoss of the services of the Company\u2019s top executives, and an inability to effectively manage leadership transitions, could adversely affect the business.\nThomas W. Florsheim, Jr., the Company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John W. Florsheim, the Company\u2019s President, Chief Operating Officer and Assistant Secretary, each have a strong heritage within the Company and the footwear industry. They possess knowledge, relationships and reputations based on their lifetime exposure to and experience in the Company and the industry. The unexpected loss of either one or both of the Company\u2019s top executives could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s performance. In addition, transitions of important responsibilities to new individuals include the possibility of disruptions, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company may not be able to successfully integrate new brands and businesses.\nThe Company continues to look for acquisition opportunities. Those search efforts could be unsuccessful and costs could be incurred in any failed efforts. Further, if and when an acquisition occurs, the Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to successfully integrate the brand into its current operations, or that any acquired brand would achieve results in line with the Company\u2019s historical performance or its specific expectations for the brand.\nRisks related to financing, investment and pension matters\nVolatility and uncertainty in the U.S. and global credit markets could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nU.S. and global financial markets have at times been unstable and unpredictable, which has generally resulted in tightened credit markets with heightened lending standards and terms. Volatility and instability in the credit markets pose various risks to the Company, including, among others, a negative impact on retailer and consumer confidence, limits to the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 access to credit markets and\ninterference with the normal commercial relationships between the Company and its customers. Increased credit risks associated with the financial condition of some customers in the retail industry affects their level of purchases from the Company and the collectability of amounts owed to the Company, and in some cases, causes the Company to reduce or cease shipments to certain customers who no longer meet the Company\u2019s credit requirements.\nIn addition, weak economic conditions and unstable and volatile financial markets could lead to certain of the Company\u2019s customers experiencing cash flow problems, which may force them into higher default rates or to file for bankruptcy protection which may increase the Company\u2019s bad debt expense or further negatively impact the Company\u2019s business.\nInterest rate volatility may increase the cost of financing. The Company\u2019s U.S. dollar variable rate debt currently uses London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark for determining interest rates. The Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. While the Company does not expect that the transition from LIBOR, including any legal or regulatory changes made in response to its future phase out, or the risks related to its discontinuance, will have a material effect on its financing costs, the ultimate future impact is uncertain.\nDeterioration of the municipal bond market in general or of specific municipal bonds held by the Company or its pension plan may result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nThe Company maintains an investment portfolio consisting primarily of investment-grade municipal bond investments. The Company\u2019s investment policy only permits the purchase of investment-grade securities. The Company\u2019s investment portfolio totaled $15 million as of December 31, 2020, or approximately 6% of total assets. If the value of municipal bonds in general or any of the Company\u2019s municipal bond holdings deteriorate, the performance of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks related to our defined benefit plan may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.\nSignificant changes in actual investment returns on defined benefit plan assets, discount rates, mortality assumptions and other factors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and the amounts of contributions the Company must make to its defined benefit plan in future periods. As the Company marks-to-market its defined benefit plan assets and liabilities on an annual basis, large non-cash gains or losses could be recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. require that the Company calculate income or expense for the plan using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. Funding requirements for the Company\u2019s defined benefit plans are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to defined benefit funding obligations. For a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to determine pension expense, refer to \"Critical Accounting Policies\" included in Item 7, \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nRisk factors related to cybersecurity\nThe Company is dependent on information and communication systems to support its business and e-commerce sales. Significant interruptions could disrupt its business and damage its reputation.\nThe Company accepts and fills the majority of its larger customers\u2019 orders through the use of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), and it relies on its warehouse management system to efficiently process orders. The Company\u2019s corporate office relies on computer systems to efficiently process and record transactions. Significant interruptions in the Company\u2019s EDI, information and communication systems from power loss, telecommunications failure, malicious attacks, or computer system failure could significantly disrupt the Company\u2019s business and operations, as well as damage its reputation. In addition, the Company sells footwear on its websites, and failures of the Company\u2019s or other retailers\u2019 websites could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales, results, and reputation.\nThe Company, particularly its retail segment and its e-commerce businesses, is subject to the risk of data loss and security breaches.\nThe Company sells footwear in its retail stores and on its websites, and therefore the Company and/or its third-party credit card processors must process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including personal information of its customers. Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches, including breaches of Company technology and systems, could expose the Company or its customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information, adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results, result in litigation or potential liability for the Company, and otherwise harm the Company\u2019s business and/or reputation. Our technology and systems, as well as those of our partners have, and in the future may, become the target of cyberattacks. To this point, the Company has not experienced a material breach; however, in order to address these risks, the Company has secured cyber insurance and it uses third party technology and systems to aid in safeguarding the Company\u2019s data and systems, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Although the Company has developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches,\nincluding systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security.\nRisk factors related to our capital structure\nThe limited public float and trading volume for the Company\u2019s stock may have an adverse impact on the stock price or make it difficult to liquidate.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is held by a relatively small number of shareholders. The Florsheim family owns approximately 50% of the stock and one institutional shareholder holds a significant block. Other officers, directors, and members of management own stock or have the potential to own stock through previously granted stock options and restricted stock. Consequently, the Company has a relatively small public float and low average daily trading volume, which could affect a shareholder\u2019s ability to sell stock or the price at which it can be sold. In addition, future sales of substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s common stock in the public market by large shareholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely impact the market price of the stock and the stock could be difficult for the shareholder to liquidate.", "PERMNO": 38033, "SIC": 5130, "TIC": "WEYS"}
