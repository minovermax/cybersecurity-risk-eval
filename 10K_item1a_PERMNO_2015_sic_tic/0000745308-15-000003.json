{"cik": "745308", "company": "ST JOE CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also materially and adversely affect our business. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Current Business Strategy\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and financial performance.\nFollowing the AgReserves Sale and RiverTown Sale that were completed in 2014, our cash and available-for-sale securities comprise over fifty percent of the carrying value of our assets, while our assets related to our existing investments in real estate only comprise about one-quarter of the carrying value of our assets. Our future financial performance and success are therefore heavily dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully.\nOur current business strategy envisions several initiatives, including recruiting and retaining a future Chief Executive Officer, investing in new opportunities, such as the development of our mixed-use and active adult communities, developing new commercial and industrial uses for our land portfolio, entering into strategic alliances and continuing to efficiently contribute to our bottom line performance. We may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy or achieve the benefits of our business plan. In addition, it is possible that some or all of our business strategy will change depending on the experience, vision, and attributes of future leadership. If we are not successful in achieving our objectives, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be negatively affected.\nManagement has discretion as to the investments we make and may not use these funds effectively.\nWe plan to continue to invest in available-for-sale securities until we can find what we believe to be other advantageous opportunities for these funds. Our management has discretion in the selection of both our available-for-sale securities and our real estate investments and could make investments that do not improve our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition or enhance the value of our common stock or which results in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and stock price.\nOur investment in new business opportunities is inherently risky, and could disrupt our ongoing businesses and adversely affect our operations.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new business opportunities, such as the development of our mixed-use and active adult communities and the expansion of port related opportunities at the Port of St. Joe. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments including development costs, inadequate return of capital on our investments, and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such opportunities. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe intend to invest our assets in ways such that we will not have to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As a result, we may be unable to make some potentially profitable investments.\nWe are not registered as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act and we intend to invest our assets in such a manner so that we are not required to register as an investment company. This will require monitoring our portfolio so that (a) we will not have more than 40% percent of total assets (excluding U.S. government securities and cash items) in investment securities or (b) we will meet and maintain another exemption from registration. As a result, we may be (1) unable to make some potentially profitable investments, (2) unable to sell assets we would otherwise want to sell or (3) forced to sell investments in investment securities before we would otherwise want to do so.\nIf The Fairholme Funds or Fairholme Capital Management, L.L.C. controls us within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, we may be unable to engage in transactions with potential strategic partners, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe Fairholme Fund (\u201cFairholme\u201d) (a series of Fairholme Funds, Inc. an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d)) has the right to vote as of December 31, 2014 approximately 25.8% of our outstanding common stock. Fairholme Capital Management, L.L.C. (\u201cFairholme Capital\u201d), which controls Fairholme, is the investment adviser of accounts that in the aggregate own, as of December 31, 2014, an additional 1.3% of our common stock. Bruce R. Berkowitz, the Managing Member of Fairholme Capital Management, L.L.C., and the President of Fairholme Funds, Inc., is the Chairman of our Board of Directors. Under the Investment Company Act, \u201ccontrol\u201d means the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company, unless such power is solely the result of an official position with such company. Any person who owns beneficially, either directly or through one or more controlled companies, more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of a company is presumed to control such company. The SEC has considered factors other than ownership of voting securities in determining control, including an official position with the company when such was obtained as a result of the influence over the company. Accordingly, even if Fairholme\u2019s beneficial ownership in us is below 25% of our outstanding voting securities, Fairholme may nevertheless be deemed to control us. The Investment Company Act generally prohibits a company controlled by an investment company from engaging in certain transactions with any affiliate of the investment company or affiliates of the affiliate, subject to limited exceptions. An affiliate of an investment company is defined in the Investment Company Act as, among other things, any company 5% or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or held with power to vote, by the investment company, a company directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, the investment company or a company directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote, 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the investment company.\nWe believe that Fairholme is currently affiliated with a number of entities, including American International Group Inc, Bank of America Corp., Leucadia National Corporation and Sears Holdings Corporation. Due to these affiliations, should Fairholme be deemed to control us, we may be prohibited from engaging in certain transactions with these entities and certain of their affiliates and any future affiliates of Fairholme, unless one of the limited exceptions applies. This could adversely affect our ability to enter into transactions freely and compete in the marketplace. In addition, significant penalties and other consequences may arise as a result of a violation for companies found to be in violation of the Investment Company Act.\nReturns on our investments may be limited by our investment guidelines and restrictions.\nIn 2013, we established investment guidelines and restrictions approved by the Investment Committee of our Board of Directors pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement with Fairholme Capital. The investment guidelines require that, as of the date of any investment: (i) at least 50% of the investment account be held in cash or cash equivalents, (ii) no more than 15% of the investment account may be invested in securities of any one issuer (excluding the U.S. Government), (iii) any investment in any one issuer (excluding the U.S. Government) that exceeds 10%, but not 15%, requires the consent of at least two members of the Investment Committee, and (iv) the investment account may not be invested in common stock securities. These limitations may restrict our ability to make certain investments and may negatively impact the return that we could otherwise receive from our investment account. This could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nOur future growth is dependent on transactions with strategic partners. We may not be able to successfully (1) attract desirable strategic partners; (2) complete agreements with strategic partners; and/or (3) manage relationships with strategic partners going forward, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may seek strategic partnerships to develop mixed-use and active adult communities, capitalize on the potential of our commercial and industrial opportunities and maximize the value of our assets. These strategic partnerships may bring development experience, industry expertise, financial resources, financing capabilities, brand recognition and credibility or other competitive assets. We cannot assure, however, that we will have sufficient resources, experience and/or skills to locate desirable partners. We also may not be able to attract partners who want to conduct business in desirable geographic locations and who have the assets, reputation or other characteristics that would optimize our development opportunities.\nOnce a strategic partner has been identified, actually reaching an agreement on a transaction may be difficult to complete and may take a considerable amount of time considering that negotiations require careful balancing of the parties\u2019 various objectives, assets, skills and interests. A formal partnership may also involve special risks such as:\n\u2022\nour partner may take actions contrary to our instructions or requests, or contrary to our policies or objectives with respect to the real estate investments;\n\u2022\nour partner could experience financial difficulties, become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of capital contributions, which may delay construction or development of property or increase our financial commitment to the strategic partnership;\n\u2022\nwe may disagree with our partner about decisions affecting the real estate investments or partnership, which could result in litigation or arbitration that increases our expenses, distracts our officers and directors and disrupts the day-to-day operations of the property, including by delaying important decisions until the dispute is resolved; and\n\u2022\nactions by our partner may subject property owned by the partnership to liabilities or have other adverse consequences.\nA key complicating factor is that strategic partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or that are influenced by factors unrelated to our business. These competing interests lead to the difficult challenges of successfully managing the relationship and communication between strategic partners and monitoring the execution of the partnership plan. We cannot assure that we will have sufficient resources, experience and/or skills to effectively manage our ongoing relationships with our strategic partners. We may also be subject to adverse business consequences if the market reputation of a strategic partner deteriorates. If we cannot successfully execute transactions with strategic partners, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be adversely affected.\nLosses in the fair value of our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments, and the concentration of our investment portfolio in any particular issuer, industry, group of related industries or geographic sector, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we have an investment account of $656.9 million which is managed by Fairholme Capital. Of this amount, $20.0 million is held in cash equivalents, $509.8 million is held in U.S. Treasury securities, $100.1 million is held in corporate debt securities and $27.0 million is held in preferred stock investments. The market value of these investments is subject to change from period to period. Our available-for-sale securities, include corporate debt securities that are issued by one issuer who is a national retail chain that is non-investment grade and our preferred stock investment that is also non-investment grade and was issued by two financial services firms. Furthermore, pursuant to our Investment Agreement with Fairholme Capital, our investment advisor, we could invest up to a total of fifteen percent of the investment account in any one issuer as of the date of purchase.\nWe have exposure to credit risk associated with our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments, which include U.S. Treasury securities, corporate debt securities, preferred stock investments and retained interest investments. These instruments are also subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial market\u2019s assessment of issuer credit quality, increases in delinquency and default rates, changes in prevailing interest rates and other economic factors. A downgrade of the U.S. government\u2019s credit rating could also decrease the value of our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments.\nLosses in the fair value of our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such securities are other-than-temporary impaired. The evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment is based on various factors, including the financial condition, business prospects, industry and creditworthiness of the issuer, severity and length of time the securities were in a loss position, our ability and intent to hold investments until unrealized losses are recovered or until maturity and amount of the unrealized loss. If a decline in fair value is considered other-than-temporary, the carrying amount of the security is written down and the amount of the credit-related component is recognized in earnings. During 2014, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment for credit-related losses of $1.3 million related to our corporate debt securities in Investment income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAny further losses in the fair value of our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments that are deemed to be other-than-temporary due to credit deterioration will result in us being required to record further credit-related losses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Furthermore, as a result of the concentration of our corporate debt securities and preferred stock investments, the performance of our investments may be disproportionately affected by any adverse change in the financial condition of these issuers or the market value of any of the securities in our portfolio, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Current Business\nOur results of operations may vary significantly from period to period which could adversely impact our stock price, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nHistorically, we derived a substantial portion of our income from our forestry operations which had more of a consistent flow of revenues. However, following the AgReserves Sale, variability in our period to period results of operations and cash flows has become more apparent as income from our forestry operations has been reduced. In addition, our customer mix in our residential real estate business has changed from some retail sales, which have a more consistent flow of revenues, to almost exclusively sales to homebuilders who tend to buy in sporadic, bulk purchases. Commercial real estate projects are likewise subject to one-off sales and the development of specific projects depending on demand.\nMoreover, as it relates to all of our residential and commercial land-use entitlements in hand or in process, we seek higher and better uses for our assets through a range of activities from strategic land planning and development, infrastructure improvements and promoting economic development in the regions where we operate; and therefore may explore the sale of assets opportunistically or when we believe they have reached their highest and best use. As a consequence, there may be reporting periods in which we have no, or significantly less, revenues from residential or commercial real estate sales.\nFurthermore, our resorts, leisure and leasing operations are affected by seasonal fluctuations. Revenues from our resorts, leisure and leasing operations businesses are typically higher in the second and third quarters; however, they can vary depending on the timing of holidays and school breaks, including spring break.\nThese variables have caused, and may continue to cause, our operating results to vary significantly from period to period which could have an adverse impact on our stock price, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation and growth management initiatives that may restrict, make more costly or otherwise adversely impact our ability to develop our real estate investments or otherwise conduct our operations.\nA large part of our business strategy is dependent on our ability to develop real estate in Northwest Florida, including opportunities in the mixed-use and active adult communities and expanding the Port of St. Joe operations. Approval to develop real property in Florida entails an extensive entitlements process involving multiple and overlapping regulatory jurisdictions and often requiring discretionary action by local government. This process is often political, uncertain and may require significant exactions in order to secure approvals. Real estate projects in Florida must generally comply with the provisions of the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act (the \u201cGrowth Management Act\u201d) and local land development regulations. In addition, development projects that exceed certain specified regulatory thresholds require approval of a comprehensive Development of Regional Impact, or DRI, application. Compliance with the Growth Management Act, local land development regulations and the DRI process is usually lengthy and costly and can be expected to materially affect our real estate development activities.\nThe Growth Management Act requires local governments to adopt comprehensive plans guiding and controlling future real property development in their respective jurisdictions and to evaluate, assess and keep those plans current. Included in all comprehensive plans is a future land use map which sets forth allowable land use development rights. Since a lot of our land has an \u201cagricultural\u201d or \u201csilviculture\u201d future land use designation, we are required to seek an amendment to the future land use map to develop residential, commercial and mixed-use projects. Approval of these comprehensive plan map amendments is highly discretionary.\nAll development orders and permits must be consistent with the comprehensive plan. Each plan must address such topics as future land use and capital improvements and make adequate provision for a multitude of public services including transportation, schools, solid waste disposal, sanitation, sewerage, potable water supply, drainage, affordable housing, open space parks and others. The local governments\u2019 comprehensive plans must also establish \u201clevels of service\u201d with respect to certain specified public facilities, including roads and schools, and services to residents. In many areas, infrastructure funding has not kept pace with growth, causing facilities to operate below established levels of service. Local governments are prohibited from issuing development orders or permits if the development will reduce the level of service for public facilities below the level of service established in the local government\u2019s comprehensive plan, unless the developer either sufficiently improves the services up front to meet the required level or provides financial assurances that the additional services will be provided as the project progresses. In addition, local governments that fail to keep their plans current may be prohibited by law from amending their plans to allow for new development.\nIf any one or more of these factors were to occur, we may be unable to develop our primary communities or planned mixed-use and active adult communities successfully or within the expected timeframes. Changes in the Growth Management Act or the DRI review process or the interpretation thereof, new enforcement of these laws or the enactment of new laws regarding the development of real property could lead to a decline in our ability to develop and market our communities successfully and to generate positive cash flow from these operations in a timely manner which could have a materially adverse affect our ability to service our demand and negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nOur existing real estate investments are concentrated in Northwest Florida; therefore our long-term financial results are largely dependent on the economic growth of Northwest Florida.\nThe economic growth of Northwest Florida, where most of our land is located, is an important factor in creating demand for our products and services. Our principal sources of revenue are (1) sales of land to homebuilders and others in connection with residential housing developments, (2) sales and leasing of commercial real estate, (3) revenues generated through our hotel and other leasing activities that are principally tourism related and (4) future revenue from the Port of St. Joe operations and our planned mixed-use and active adult communities. Consequently, demand for our products largely depends on the growth of the local economy.\nWe believe that the future economic growth of Northwest Florida will largely depend on the ability and willingness of state and local governments, in combination with the private sector, (1) to plan and complete significant infrastructure improvements in the region, such as new transportation hubs, roads, rail, pipeline, medical facilities and schools and (2) to attract companies offering high-quality, high salary jobs to large numbers of new employees. If new businesses and new employees in Northwest Florida do not grow as anticipated, demand for residential and commercial real estate and demand to expand the Port of St. Joe will not meet our expectations and our future growth will be adversely affected.\nChanges in the demographics affecting projected population growth in Florida, particularly Northwest Florida, including a decrease in the migration of Baby Boomers, could adversely affect our business.\nFlorida has experienced strong population growth in the past few decades, particularly during the real estate boom in the first half of the last decade. However, a decline in the rate of migration into Florida could occur due to a number of factors affecting Florida, including weak economic conditions, restrictive credit, the occurrence of hurricanes and increased costs of living. Also, because of the recent housing collapse across the nation, people interested in moving to Florida may have delayed or canceled their plans due to difficulties selling their existing homes.\nThe success of our primary communities and planned mixed-use and active adult communities will be dependent on strong migration population expansion in our regions of development, primarily Northwest Florida. We also believe that Baby Boomers seeking retirement or vacation homes in Florida will remain important target customers for our real estate products in the future. Florida\u2019s population growth could be negatively affected in the future by factors such as adverse economic conditions, the occurrence of natural or manmade disasters and the high cost of real estate, insurance and property taxes. Furthermore, those persons considering moving to Florida may not view Northwest Florida as an attractive place to live or own a second home and may choose to live in another region of the state. In addition, as an alternative to Florida, other states such as Georgia, North and South Carolina and Tennessee are increasingly becoming retirement destinations and are attracting retiring Baby Boomers and the workforce population who may have otherwise considered moving to Florida. If Florida, especially Northwest Florida, experiences an extended period of slow growth, or even net out-migration, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition would suffer.\nWe have significant operations and properties in Florida that could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters, manmade disasters, severe weather conditions or other significant disruptions.\nOur corporate headquarters and our properties are located in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred. Because of its location between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, Florida is particularly susceptible to the occurrence of hurricanes. Depending on where any particular hurricane makes landfall, our developments in Florida, especially our coastal properties in Northwest Florida, could experience significant, if not catastrophic, damage. Such damage could materially delay sales or lessen demand for our residential or commercial real estate in affected communities and lessen demand for our resorts, leisure and leasing operations, such as disrupting our resort and vacation rental business if there are extensive repairs to the facilities or by lessening demand as a vacation destination. If our corporate headquarters facility is damaged or destroyed, we may have difficulty performing certain corporate and operational functions.\nIn addition to hurricanes, the occurrence of other natural disasters and climate conditions in Florida, such as tornadoes, floods, fires, unusually heavy or prolonged rain, droughts and heat waves, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and sell properties or realize income from our projects. The occurrence of these natural disasters could also have a material adverse effect on our forestry business, if timber inventory is destroyed. Furthermore, an increase in sea levels due to long-term global warming could have a material adverse effect on our coastal properties and forestry business. The occurrence of natural disasters and the threat of adverse climate changes could also have a long-term negative effect on the attractiveness of Florida as a location for resort, seasonal and/or primary residences and as a location for new employers that can create high-quality jobs needed to spur growth in Northwest Florida.\nAdditionally, we are susceptible to manmade disasters or disruptions, such as oil spills like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, acts of terrorism, power outages and communications failures. If a hurricane, natural disaster, manmade disaster or other significant disruption occurs, we may experience disruptions to our operations and properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nOur insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate to cover any losses we may incur.\nWe maintain insurance on our property, including property, liability, fire, flood and extended coverage. However, we do not insure our timber assets and self-insure home warranty claims. Additionally, our insurance for hurricanes is capped at $50 million per named storm and is subject to deductibles. We use our discretion when determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibles for insurance. These terms are determined based on retaining an acceptable level of risk at a reasonable cost. This may result in insurance coverage that in the event of a substantial loss would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also may make it unfeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a facility after it has been damaged or destroyed. Under such circumstances, we may not receive insurance proceeds or the insurance proceeds we receive may not fully cover business interruptions or losses and our earnings, liquidity, or capital resources could be adversely affected.\nIncreases in property insurance premiums and decreases in availability of homeowner property insurance in Florida could reduce customer demand for homes and homesites in our developments.\nHomeowner property insurance companies doing business in Florida have reacted to previous hurricanes by increasing premiums, requiring higher deductibles, reducing limits, restricting coverage, imposing exclusions, refusing to insure certain property owners, and in some instances, ceasing insurance operations in the state. It is uncertain what effect these actions may have on property insurance availability and rates in the state.\nFurthermore, Florida\u2019s state-owned property insurance company, Citizens Property Insurance Corp., underwrites homeowner property insurance. If there were to be a catastrophic hurricane or series of hurricanes to hit Florida, the exposure of the state government to property insurance claims could place extreme stress on state finances.\nThe high costs of property insurance premiums in Florida could deter potential customers from purchasing a homesite in one of our developments or make Northwest Florida less attractive to new employers that can create high quality jobs needed to spur growth in the region, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nA decline in consumers\u2019 discretionary spending or a change in consumer preferences could reduce our sales and harm our business.\nOur real estate and resorts and leisure businesses\u2019 sales ultimately depend on consumer discretionary spending, which is influenced by factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the availability of discretionary income and credit, weather, consumer confidence and unemployment levels. Any material decline in the amount of consumer discretionary spending could reduce our sales and harm our business. These economic and market conditions, combined with continuing difficulties in the credit markets and the resulting pressures on liquidity, may also place a number of our key customers under financial stress, which would could adversely affect our occupancy rates and our profitability.\nFurther downturns of the real estate market in Northwest Florida could adversely affect our operations.\nDemand for real estate is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, the availability of financing and interest rate levels, over which we have no control. In addition, the real estate market is subject to downturns; and, furthermore, our business is especially sensitive to economic conditions in Northwest Florida, where many of our developments are located, and the Southeast region of the United States, which in the past has produced a high percentage of customers for the resort and seasonal products in our Northwest Florida communities. Unemployment, lack of consumer confidence and other adverse consequences of the previous economic recession continue to affect the economies of these two regions. If market conditions do not continue to improve as anticipated or were to worsen, the demand for our real estate products could decline, negatively impacting our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nMortgage financing issues, including lack of supply of mortgage loans, tightened lending requirements and possible future increases in interest rates, could reduce demand for our products.\nMany purchasers of our real estate products obtain mortgage loans to finance a substantial portion of the purchase price, or they may need to obtain mortgage loans to finance the construction costs of homes to be built on homesites purchased from us. Also, our homebuilder customers depend on retail purchasers who rely on mortgage financing. Many mortgage lenders and investors in mortgage loans experienced severe financial difficulties arising from losses incurred on sub-prime and other loans originated before the downturn in the real estate market. As a result, the mortgage industry remains under scrutiny and continues to face the challenges of increased regulation at federal, state, and local levels. Because of these challenges, the supply of mortgage products has been constrained, and the eligibility requirements for borrowers have been tightened. Constraints on the mortgage lending industry could adversely affect potential purchasers of our products, including our homebuilder customers, thus having a negative effect on demand for our products.\nWhile interest rates for home mortgage loans have generally remained low, mortgage interest rates could increase in the future which could adversely affect the demand for residential real estate. In addition to residential real estate, increased interest rates and restrictions in the availability of credit could also negatively impact sales of our commercial properties or other land we offer for sale. If interest rates increase and the ability or willingness of prospective buyers to finance real estate purchases is adversely affected, our sales, results of operations, cash flows and financial position may be negatively affected.\nTax law changes could make home ownership more expensive or less attractive.\nHistorically, significant expenses of owning a home, including mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes, generally have been deductible expenses for the purpose of calculating an individual\u2019s federal, and in some cases state, taxable income as itemized deductions. The Federal government has been considering eliminating some deductions, or limiting the tax benefit of deductions, with regard to people with incomes above specified levels. As part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, enacted on January 1, 2013, beginning in 2013 certain taxpayers will have their itemized deductions limited. Changes in tax laws could increase the after-tax cost of owning a home, which is likely to impact adversely the demand for homes and could reduce the prices for which we can sell homes, particularly in higher priced communities.\nSignificant competition could have an adverse effect on our business.\nA number of residential and commercial developers, some with greater financial and other resources, compete with us in seeking resources for development and prospective purchasers and tenants. Competition from other real estate developers may adversely affect our ability to attract purchasers and sell residential and commercial real estate and attract and retain experienced real estate development personnel.\nA number of highly competitive companies participate in the vacation rental industry. Last year, we launched St. Joe Club & Resorts, a private membership club that provides access to a diverse offering of benefits and privileges at certain of our owned and operated resort facilities. In addition, certain facilities are private clubs and only members and registered guests of St. Joe Club & Resorts are eligible to play. Our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain vacation rental owners and memberships depends on our success in distinguishing the quality and value of our products and services from those offered by others.\nIn addition, the forestry business is highly competitive in terms of price and quality. Wood products are subject to increasing competition from a variety of substitute products, including non-wood and engineered wood products. There can be no assurance we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon homebuilders as customers, but our ability to attract homebuilder customers and their ability or willingness to satisfy their purchase commitments may be uncertain.\nWe are highly dependent upon our relationships with homebuilders to be the primary customers for our homesites and to provide construction services at our residential developments. The homebuilder customers that have already committed to purchase homesites from us could decide to reduce, delay or cancel their existing commitments to purchase homesites in our developments. From time to time we finance real estate sales with mortgage note receivables. If these homebuilders fail to pay their debts to us or delay paying us, it would reduce our anticipated cash flows. Homebuilders also may not view our developments as desirable locations for homebuilding operations, or they may choose to purchase land from distressed sellers. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with real estate development that could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur real estate development activities entail risks that could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nconstruction delays or cost overruns, which may increase project development costs;\n\u2022\nclaims for construction defects after property has been developed, including claims by purchasers and property owners\u2019 associations;\n\u2022\nan inability to obtain required governmental permits and authorizations;\n\u2022\nan inability to secure tenants necessary to support commercial projects; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with building codes and other local regulations.\nOur commercial leasing projects may not yield anticipated returns, which could harm our operating results, reduce cash flow, or the ability to sell commercial assets.\nA component of our business strategy is the development of commercial properties and assets for sale. These developments may not be as successful as expected due to the commercial leasing related risks, as well as the risks associated with real estate development, generally. Additionally, development of commercial projects involves the risk associated with the significant time lag between commencement and completion of the project. This time lag subjects us to greater risks relating to fluctuations in the general economy, our ability to obtain construction or permanent financing on favorable terms, if at all, our ability to achieve projected rental rates, the pace that we will be able to lease to new tenants, higher than estimated construction costs (including labor and material costs), and delays in the completion of projects because of, among other factors, inclement weather, labor disruptions, construction delays or delays in receiving zoning or other regulatory approvals, or man-made or natural disasters. If any one of these factors negatively impacts our commercial leasing projects we may not yield anticipated returns, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows and ability to sell commercial assets.\nWe guarantee debt for our Pier Park North joint venture, and may in the future enter into similar agreements, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe have agreed to provide certain guarantees in connection with our Pier Park North joint venture, and may in the future agree to similar agreements. Our Pier Park North joint venture has entered into a $41 million construction loan that matures in February 2016. Pursuant to the construction loan, we have provided the following guarantees: (i) a completion guarantee until substantial completion; (ii) a principal repayment guarantee limited to 33% of the outstanding balance of the loan; (iii) a guarantee covering, among other things, operating deficits and accrued and unpaid interest; and (iv) customary non-recourse covenants covering items like misrepresentation, misappropriation of funds and fraud. If we were to become obligated to perform on any guarantees, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nEnvironmental and other regulations may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur properties are subject to federal, state and local environmental regulations and restrictions that may impose significant limitations on our development ability. In most cases, approval to develop requires multiple permits which involve a long, uncertain and costly regulatory process. Our land holdings contain jurisdictional wetlands, some of which may be unsuitable for development or prohibited from development by law. Development approval most often requires mitigation for impacts to wetlands that require land to be conserved at a disproportionate ratio versus the actual wetlands impacted and approved for development. Some of our property is undeveloped land located in areas where development may have to avoid, minimize or mitigate for impacts to the natural habitats of various protected wildlife or plant species. Additionally, much of our property is in coastal areas that usually have a more restrictive permitting burden and must address issues such as coastal high hazard, hurricane evacuation, floodplains and dune protection.\nIn addition, our current or past ownership, operation and leasing of real property, and our current or past transportation and other operations, are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local environmental laws and other regulations. The provisions and enforcement of these environmental laws and regulations may become more stringent in the future. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in:\n\u2022\ncivil penalties;\n\u2022\nremediation expenses;\n\u2022\nnatural resource damages;\n\u2022\npersonal injury damages;\n\u2022\npotential injunctions;\n\u2022\ncease and desist orders; and\n\u2022\ncriminal penalties.\nIn addition, some of these environmental laws impose strict liability, which means that we may be held liable for any environmental damage on our property regardless of fault.\nSome of our past and present real property, particularly properties used in connection with our previous transportation and papermill operations, were involved in the storage, use or disposal of hazardous substances that have contaminated and may in the future contaminate the environment. We may bear liability for this contamination and for the costs of cleaning up a site at which we have disposed of, or to which we have transported, hazardous substances. The presence of hazardous substances on a property may also adversely affect our ability to sell or develop the property or to borrow funds using the property as collateral.\nChanges in laws or the interpretation thereof, new enforcement of laws, the identification of new facts or the failure of other parties to perform remediation at our current or former facilities could lead to new or greater liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nLimitations on the access to the airport runway at the new Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport may have an adverse effect on the demand for our West Bay Sector lands adjacent to the new airport.\nOur land donation agreement with the airport authority and the deed for the airport land provide access rights to the airport runway from our adjacent lands. We subsequently entered into an access agreement with the airport authority that provides access to the airport runway. Under the terms of the access agreement, we are subject to certain requirements of the airport authority, including but not limited to the laws administered by the Federal Aviation Administration (the \u201cFAA\u201d), the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and Bay County. Should security measures at airports become more restrictive in the future due to circumstances beyond our control, FAA regulations governing these access rights may impose additional limitations that could significantly impair or restrict access rights.\nIn addition, we are required to obtain environmental permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Florida\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection in order to develop the land necessary for access from our planned areas of commercial development to the airport runway. Such permits are often subject to a lengthy approval process, and there can be no assurance that such permits will be issued, or that they will be issued in a timely manner.\nWe believe that runway access is a valuable attribute of some of our West Bay Sector lands adjacent to the new airport, and the failure to maintain such access, or the imposition of significant restrictions on such access, could adversely affect the demand for such lands and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nWeather and other natural conditions and regulatory requirements may limit our ability to sell timber, which could adversely affect our operations.\nWeather conditions, timber growth cycles, access limitations (for example, restrictions on access to timberlands due to prolonged wet conditions) and regulatory requirements associated with the protection of wildlife and water resources may restrict our ability to sell timber. In addition, our timber is subject to damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought, flooding and other natural disasters. Changes in global climate conditions could intensify one or more of these factors. Although damage from such natural causes usually is localized and affects only a limited percentage of the timber, there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will in fact be so limited. As is common in the forestry industry, we do not maintain insurance coverage with respect to damage to our timberlands. Our results of operations and cash flows may therefore be materially adversely affected if we are unable to sell our timber at adequate levels or if demand decreases due to an increase in our prices as a result of any of these factors.\nRisks Related to Our Company or Common Stock\nAn adverse outcome of the investigation being conducted by the SEC could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nIn January 2011, the SEC commenced an informal inquiry into our accounting practices for impairment of investment in real estate assets and then notified us in June of 2011 that it had issued a related order of private investigation. On January 20, 2015, we received a written \u201cWells Notice\u201d from the Staff of the SEC (the \u201cStaff\u201d) indicating the Staff\u2019s preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an action against the Company for violations of certain federal securities laws. The Staff has informed us that the Wells Notice relates to historical accounting and disclosure practices and real estate asset valuations principally as reflected in our financial results for 2010, 2009 and prior periods. We are fully cooperating with the SEC\u2019s investigation. However, we are unable to predict the outcome of the SEC\u2019s investigation. An adverse outcome of the investigation by the SEC could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange has been volatile in recent years. We may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock. Numerous factors could have a significant effect on the price of our common stock, including:\n\u2022announcements of fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022other announcements concerning our Company or business, including acquisitions or litigation announcements;\n\u2022changes in market conditions in Northwest Florida or the real estate or real estate development industry in general;\n\u2022changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years, which have sometimes been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. Volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause shareholders to lose some or all of their investment in our common stock.\nThe Fairholme Funds or Fairholme Capital has the ability to influence major corporate decisions.\nBruce R. Berkowitz, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, is the Managing Member of Fairholme Capital, and the President of Fairholme Funds, Inc. Fairholme Funds has the right to vote, as of December 31, 2014, approximately 25.8% of our outstanding common stock. Fairholme Capital is the investment adviser of accounts that in the aggregate own, as of December 31, 2014, an additional 1.3% of our common stock. Accordingly, Fairholme Funds and Fairholme Capital are in a position to influence:\n\u2022\nthe vote of most matters submitted to our shareholders, including any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nthe nomination of individuals to our Board of Directors; and\n\u2022\na change in our control.\nThese factors may discourage, delay or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests or that might result in shareholders receiving a premium for their common stock. Our articles of incorporation and certain provisions of Florida law contain anti-takeover provisions that may make it more difficult to effect a change in our control.\nThe loss of the services of our key management, personnel or our ability to recruit staff could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business strategy will depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced and knowledgeable management and other professional staff. In addition, we are in the process of selecting future leadership to replace our CEO after his retirement in August of 2014. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining key management personnel.\nChanges in our income tax estimates could materially impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, significant management judgment is required to estimate our income taxes. Our estimates are based on our interpretation of federal and state tax laws. We estimate our actual current tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. The temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities, and changes in tax laws and rates. To the extent adjustments are required in any given period, we include the adjustments in the deferred tax assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements. These adjustments could materially impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nWe may not be able to utilize our net state operating loss carryforwards.\nIn prior years, we have suffered losses, for tax and financial statement purposes, which generated significant state net operating loss carryforwards. While we utilized a portion of our state net operating loss carryforwards as a result of the AgReserves Sale in 2014, we still have a significant amount of state net operating loss carryforwards. These may be used against future taxable income in future periods; however, we will not receive any tax benefits with regard to tax losses incurred except to the extent we have taxable income in the remaining net operating loss carryforward period. Based on the timing of reversals of our existing taxable temporary differences and our history of losses, management does not believe that the requirements to realize the benefits of certain of our deferred tax assets have been met; therefore, we have maintained a valuation allowance against a portion of our deferred tax assets in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2014. Therefore, unless we generate more income in the future than presently estimated, we will not be able to utilize all of our net state operating loss carryforwards.\nWe have had to take significant impairments of the carrying value of our investments in real estate and a decline in real estate values or continuing operating losses in our operating properties could result in additional impairments, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nOver the past five years, we have recorded impairment charges of $393.1 million related to real estate investments. We have approximately $321.8 million of real estate investments recorded on our books that may be subject to impairment. If market conditions were to deteriorate, our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows could fall below their carrying value and we could be required to take further impairments, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nChanges in accounting pronouncements could adversely affect our reported operating results, in addition to the reported financial performance of our tenants.\nAccounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for U.S. companies, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. Proposed changes include, but are not limited to, changes in lease accounting and the adoption of accounting standards that establish the principles used to recognize revenue for all entities. These changes and others could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements.\nFailure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions, damage of reputation and/or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits.\nFor a number of years, we have been increasing our reliance on computers and digital technology. While all of our businesses and our internal employment records require the collection of digital information, our resorts and leisure businesses, in particular, require the collection and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers as such information is entered into, processed, summarized, and reported by the various information systems we use. All of these activities give rise to material cyber risks and potential costs and consequences that cannot be estimated or predicted with any certainty. The integrity and protection of our customer, employee and other company data, is critical to us. Our failure to maintain the security of the data which we are required to protect, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings, and other severe financial and business implications.", "PERMNO": 76123, "SIC": 7011, "TIC": "JOE"}
