RISK FACTORS\nThere is no change to the risk factors included in our registration statement on Form S-8 filed on November 23, 2016 other than inclusion of the following risk factor:\nThe substantial and continuing losses, and significant operating expenses incurred in the past few years may cause us to be unable to pursue all of our operational objectives if sufficient financing and/or additional cash from revenues is not realized. This raises doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have a accumulated deficit of US$70,234,656 as of December 31, 2016 and a working capital (total consolidated current assets exceeding total consolidated current liabilities) of US$2,332,909, as of December 31, 2016.\nAlthough we have previously been able to attract financing as needed, such financing may not continue to be available at all, or if available, on reasonable terms as required. Further, the terms of such financing may be dilutive to existing shareholders or otherwise on terms not favorable to us or existing shareholders. If we are unable to secure additional financing, as circumstances require, or do not succeed in meeting our sales objectives, we may be required to change or significantly reduce our operations or ultimately may not be able to continue our operations. As a result of our historical accumulated deficit, these conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.", "PERMNO": 14093, "SIC": 6159, "TIC": "GLG"}
