{"cik": "1057083", "company": "PC TEL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nFactors That May Affect Our Business, Financial Condition and Future Operations\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business model depends upon our ability to recognize significant emerging technologies in a timely manner and to innovate to solve the engineering problems presented by such emerging technologies.\nIn order to provide solutions to complex engineering problems, we must anticipate which technologies are promising and will be adopted by our customers and potential customers, and we need to be engaged early in the development of these new technologies and products. If we expend resources on the wrong technologies or are not included in the development phase of new technologies that are widely adopted in our industry, we may miss the opportunity for meaningful participation or revenue generation. Missed opportunities like these could have a negative impact on our long-term competitiveness.\nWe must attract and retain specific types of engineers and other skilled professionals who are capable of innovating and solving complex network engineering problems in order to be successful. In addition, we must create intellectual property or obtain it from third parties when necessary. We also must maintain our intellectual property and enforce the protection of our intellectual property. Failure to accomplish these tasks while managing the costs thereof will result in difficulty in distinguishing us from our competitors and may result in a significant loss of business or diminishing margin on our products.\nWe have significant international operations and face risks related to global public health crises such as the coronavirus epidemic.\nAny outbreaks of contagious diseases or other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, the recent worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus, including temporary closure of businesses, severe restrictions on travel and the movement of people, and other material limitations on the conduct of business. These measures resulted in temporary work stoppages, shipping delays, material shortages and other disruptions at our manufacturing facilities in China and the United States as well as the facilities of our suppliers, customers, and our contract manufacturers. Most of these disruptions have been resolved or improved; however, if our supply chain experiences extended disruptions, we may need to seek alternate sources of supply or transportation, which may be more expensive. Alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to us from our supply chain and subsequently to our customers, each of which would affect our results of operations. Further, if our customers\u2019 businesses are similarly affected, they might delay or reduce purchases from us, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the continuation of the spread of COVID-19 could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, negatively impacting demand for our products and our end customers\u2019 products. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nCompetition within the wireless product industry is intense and could result in decreased margins on our products or loss of key customers. Failure to compete successfully could materially harm our prospects and financial results.\nCompetition in our industry can result from the following:\n\u2022\ncompetitors, including foreign government-funded competitors, significantly reducing prices on their products causing disruption to our customer relationships.\n\u2022\ncustomers demanding lower prices and requiring suppliers like us to engage in auctions and other forms of competitive bidding for purchase orders.\n\u2022\nentrance of a significant competitor in the markets for our products, either from new participants, such as emerging low-cost international competitors, or because of a merger of existing competitors; and\n\u2022\ncompetitors with substantially greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of their products and delivery of their services. These competitors may succeed in establishing technology standards or strategic alliances in the connectivity products markets, obtain more rapid market acceptance for their products, or otherwise gain a competitive advantage.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and poses risks to, our business, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.\nIn January 2020, the World Health Organization (the \u201cWHO\u201d) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and on March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. This pandemic has resulted in a global health crisis that has adversely affected broader economies, financial markets, and our business environment. During 2020, the Company took steps to mitigate risks related to the pandemic by working with our employees, customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders. We continue to monitor the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, certain elements of our business. For brief periods during 2020, portions of our workforce were unable to work effectively due to illness and containment measures, including quarantines, facility closures, illness precautions, travel restrictions, and other restrictions. While spread of the pandemic has slowed and certain of these restrictions have been lifted, we may continue to experience volatility and delays in customer demand as a result of the impact of the pandemic on their businesses. In addition, we have instituted work-from-home guidelines for all employees who can work remotely. An extended period of remote work arrangements could strain our business plans, introduce operational risk, including, but not limited to, cybersecurity risks, and impair our ability to manage our business. Further, our management is focused on mitigating the spread of COVID-19, which has required and will continue to require a substantial investment of time and resources across our business and could delay other company initiatives. If the pandemic continues, we may experience additional adverse impacts on our operational and commercial activities, including rising costs, volatility in customer orders and purchases and declines in collections of accounts receivable, which may be material. Furthermore, the pandemic has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Due to the global breadth of the pandemic, and the range of governmental and community reactions thereto, there is uncertainty around its duration, ultimate impact, and the timing of recovery. Therefore, the pandemic could lead to an extended disruption of economic activity, delays in our sales cycle, customers cancelling purchases of our products and the impact on our stock price, consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be material.\nConducting business in foreign countries involves additional financial, operating, and regulatory risks.\nA substantial portion of our manufacturing, and a portion of our research and development and sales activities is conducted outside the United States, primarily in China.\nOn March 5, 2020, PCTEL (Tianjin) Wireless Telecommunications Products, Co. Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (\u201cPCTEL Tianjin\u201d), entered into a letter agreement with Wang Zhuang Village Committee of Tianjin, China (the \u201cLetter Agreement\u201d) specifying the terms for extension of the lease of the premises on which PCTEL Tianjin currently conducts its manufacturing activities in Tianjin, China (the \u201cTianjin Lease\u201d) to October 2022. The Letter Agreement did not, however, effect the lease extension. The Tianjin Lease expired on October 8, 2020 without extension. On October 16, 2020, the Wang Zhuang Village Committee issued a notice informing PCTEL Tianjin that the Chinese Party Central Committee and the State Council are accelerating the layout optimization and transformation of the industrial park in which the leased premises is located, and accordingly leases and lease extensions for all premises in the industrial park have been suspended and rent collection has been postponed. The letter indicates that if the Tianjin Lease extension is subsequently approved, the rent for the period from October 9, 2020 to the date of the Tianjin Lease extension (the \u201cIntervening Period\u201d) will then be due and payable. If the Tianjin Lease extension is not approved, PCTEL Tianjin will need to vacate the premises and no rent will be due for the Intervening Period. PCTEL Tianjin has not received an indication of the likelihood of approval of the Tianjin Lease extension, the length of the Intervening Period or the notice period for vacating the leased premises; provided, however,\nbased upon past practices and verbal assurances, we believe that PCTEL Tianjin will have not less than 30 days to vacate the leased premises if the Lease Extension is not approved.\nAs a result of the uncertainty regarding the Tianjin Lease renewal, we are refining our transition plan for the manufacturing activities conducted on the leased premises. Under the transition plan, we expect to maintain small operations in Tianjin and will utilize our existing contract manufacturers in China and elsewhere, as well as our Bloomingdale, Illinois facility for production of the products currently produced on the leased premises. Once transitioned, we do not intend to resume production of the transitioned products on the leased premises even if permitted. If PCTEL Tianjin is given an opportunity to extend the Tianjin Lease, PCTEL Tianjin will seek to extend the term for a short period in which the transition will be ongoing. While we believe that we will be able to maintain our supply chain and on-time product delivery during the transition period, the contemplated transition of production may initially result in quality issues, delays of in product deliveries and increased production costs which could negatively impact our revenue, expenses, and reputation. We are devoting substantial resources to assure the least disruptive transition of manufacturing processes allowed by the transition time allotted.\nIn addition, there are a number of risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries, including: (i) fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, and in particular the impact of a re-valuation of the Chinese Yuan; (ii) impact of tariffs or trade wars among the countries in which we do business; (iii) difficulties in repatriation of earnings; (iv) disruption to our supply chain, whether as a result of the spread of COVID-19 or other factors which limit our ability to import materials and export products; (v) nationalist sentiment creating advantages for our competitors in their home countries; (vi) impact of labor unrest, potentially in connection with the reduction in force of a significant portion of our workforce in Tianjin, China (vii) unexpected legal or regulatory changes, particularly changes to environmental, labor or manufacturing regulations; (viii) lack of sufficient protection for intellectual property rights and the risk of theft and forced transfer of intellectual property; (ix) difficulties in recruiting and retaining personnel and managing international operations;(x) under-developed infrastructure; and (xi) other unfavorable political or economic factors which could include nationalization of the wireless communications or related industries. If we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks pertaining to our international activities, our operating results, cash flows and financial position could be materially and adversely affected.\nAll of our imports from mainland China are subject to U.S. tariffs ranging from 7.5% to 25.0%. The tariffs apply to the antennas sent from our facility in Tianjin, China and our China-based contract manufacturers to our U.S.-based customers and components and materials sent from our Tianjin facility and our China-based contract manufacturers to our Bloomingdale, Illinois facility for final assembly. Tariffs impact the gross margin that we earn on sales of our products because we have not been able to adjust all our prices on all of our affected products to cover the entire cost of the imposed tariffs. We will continue to monitor and adjust prices as market conditions permit. The impact of the tariffs on our future revenue and profitability is uncertain. We do not believe these tariffs resulted in a significant loss of revenue in 2019 or 2020.\nAny delays in our sales cycles could result in customers canceling purchases of our products.\nSales cycles for our products with major customers can be lengthy, often lasting nine months or longer. In addition, it can take an additional nine months or more before a customer requires volume production of our products. Sales cycles with our major customers are lengthy for several reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour OEM customers and carriers usually complete a lengthy technical evaluation of our products, over which we have no control, before placing a purchase order, and\n\u2022\nthe development of new technologies and commercialization of products incorporating new technologies frequently are delayed.\nA significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and is largely based on our forecasts of volume and timing of orders. The lengthy sales cycles make forecasting the volume and timing of product orders difficult. In addition, the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional uncertainty that customers may decide to cancel or change product phases. If customer cancellations or product changes were to occur, this could result in the loss of anticipated sales without enough time for us to reduce our operating expenses.\nDisruption in our manufacturing and supply chains could adversely impact our sales and reputation.\nWe assemble our antennas in our facilities located in Bloomingdale, Illinois, and Tianjin, China, and test & measurement products at our facility in Clarksburg, Maryland. We may experience delays, disruptions, or capacity constraints (whether due to the non-renewal of our Tianjin, China facility lease, the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise) or quality control problems at our assembly facilities, which could result in lower yields or delays of product shipments to our customers. In addition, a significant number of our antennas are currently manufactured in China by contract manufacturers and we are transitioning additional products currently manufactured in our Tianjin facility to contract manufacturers in China and elsewhere. Any disruption of our own or contract manufacturers' operations could cause delayed product delivery, which could negatively impact our sales, competitive reputation, and position. Moreover, if we do not\naccurately forecast demand for our products, we will have excess or insufficient parts to build our products, either of which could materially affect our operating results and may lead to obsolete inventory.\nGiven the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations, including our manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers, may slow again depending on whether there are future resurgences in infection rates and the imposition of additional containment measures. Early in the first quarter 2020, our Tianjin, China facility ceased production for approximately one month and our Chinese contract manufacturers ceased production for several weeks due to the COVID-19 outbreak in China, and our U.S. manufacturing facilities shut down for two weeks in April 2020 and operated at less than full capacity in May 2020. We have limited in-house manufacturing capability. For some product lines, we outsource the manufacturing, assembly, and testing of printed circuit board subsystems. For other product lines, we purchase completed hardware platforms and add our proprietary software. While our suppliers have no unique capability, any failure by these suppliers to meet delivery commitments could cause delayed product delivery and potentially disrupt our supply chain and ability to accept new orders for products. The spread of COVID-19 has impacted supply chains worldwide and may impact our ability to produce and sell products.\nIn addition, in the event that for any reason our suppliers discontinue manufacturing materials used in our products, we would be forced to incur the time and expense of finding a new supplier or to modify our products in such a way that such materials were not necessary. Either of these alternatives could result in increased manufacturing costs and increased prices of our products.\nIn summary, in order to be successful, we must manage our operations to limit the cost of product production, accurately forecast demand for our products, avoid excess production and inventory that results in waste or obsolescence, dual source critical materials to avoid shortages and delays in shipping, build for manufacturability and avoid excessive quality issues.\nFuture acquisitions and investments may not yield their intended benefits. Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our business.\nIn the future, we may make acquisitions of, or large investments in, businesses that offer products and technologies that we believe would complement our products, including wireless products and technology. We may also make acquisitions of or investments in businesses that we believe could expand our distribution channels. Even if we were to announce an acquisition, we may not be able to complete it. Additionally, any future acquisition or substantial investment would present numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in integrating the technology, operations, internal accounting controls or work force of the acquired business with our existing business,\n\u2022\ndisruption of our on-going business,\n\u2022\ndifficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction,\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures, and policies,\n\u2022\ntax, employment, logistics, and other related issues unique to international organizations and assets we acquire,\n\u2022\npossible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of integration of new businesses and management personnel, and\n\u2022\nimpairment of assets related to resulting goodwill, and reductions in our future operating results from amortization of intangible assets.\nWe expect that future acquisitions may be paid in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and our common stock. If consideration for a transaction is paid in common stock, this would further dilute our existing stockholders. We may also incur debt to pay for an acquisition which could impose restrictive covenants on how we conduct our business.\nA failure in our information technology systems could negatively impact our business.\nWe rely on information technology to record and process transactions, manage our business, and maintain the financial accuracy of our records. Our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from various sources, including power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, catastrophic events, and human error. If a cyber-incident, such as a phishing or ransomware attack, virus, malware installation, server malfunction, software or hardware failure, impairment of data integrity, loss of data or other computer assets, adware or other similar issue, impairs or shuts down one or more of our computing systems or our information technology network, we may be subject to negative treatment and lawsuits. In addition, attention to remediating cyber incidents may distract our technical or management personnel from their normal responsibilities. Public announcements of such cyber incidents could occur, and negative perception of such cyber incidents could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and we could lose sales and customers. Interruptions of our computer systems could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of business and cause us to incur additional expense.\nWe, our customers and our third-party service providers face an evolving threat landscape in which cybercriminals, among others, employ a complex array of cyber-attack techniques designed to access sensitive information or disrupt our operations, including, for example, the use of fraudulent or stolen access credentials, malware, ransomware, phishing, denial of service and other types of attacks. While we have engaged experts in cybersecurity to advise us and we have taken protective measures, our information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Our information technology systems could be breached by unauthorized outside parties or misused by employees or other insiders\u2019 intent on extracting sensitive information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. Such unauthorized access could compromise confidential information, disrupt our business, harm our reputation, result in the loss of assets, customer confidence and business and have a negative impact on our financial results.\nAdditional income tax expense or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nWe are subject to income tax laws and regulations in the United States, China, and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. Our income tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and income tax liabilities could be adversely affected by the jurisdictional mix of earnings, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations. In the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to continuous examinations of our income tax returns by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the results of any tax examination or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals. Adverse developments in an audit, examination, litigation related to previously filed tax returns, or in the relevant jurisdiction\u2019s tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods.\nLegislative or regulatory initiatives related to climate change concerns may negatively affect our business.\nConcern over climate change may result in new or additional legal, legislative, and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, which could result in future tax, transportation, and utility increases, which could adversely affect our business. There is also increased focus, including by investors, customers, and other stakeholders on these and other sustainability matters, including the use of plastic, energy, waste, and worker safety. Our reputation could be damaged if we do not (or are perceived not to) act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock.\nThe trading price of our stock fluctuates, sometimes significantly, based upon a variety of factors, many of which are not under our control.\nOver time, our stock experiences significant changes in price on a percentage basis. The closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market fluctuated between a high of $9.33 and a low of $4.25 during 2020. A variety of factors, many of which are not under of our control influence our stock price, including:\n\u2022\nadverse changes in domestic or global economic conditions, including COVID-19 and recessions,\n\u2022\nnew products offered by us or our competitors,\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results,\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts,\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations,\n\u2022\nour announcement of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments,\n\u2022\nconditions or trends in our industry,\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel,\n\u2022\nmergers and acquisitions,\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by our stockholders or the Company, and\n\u2022\nrepurchases of our common stock by the Company.\nProvisions in our charter documents may inhibit a change of control or a change of management, which may cause the market price for our common stock to decline and may inhibit a takeover or change in our control that a stockholder may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our charter documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction that our stockholders may favor. Specifically, our charter documents do not permit stockholders to act by written consent, do not permit stockholders to call a stockholders meeting, and provide for a classified board of directors, which means stockholders can only elect, or remove, a limited number of our directors in any given year. These provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, and as a result, these provisions may prevent the market price of our common stock from reflecting the effects of actual or rumored takeover attempts and may prevent stockholders from reselling their shares at or above the price at which they purchased their shares. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management that our stockholders may favor.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The board of directors can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of this preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be affected by, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. Further, the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock may decline.", "PERMNO": 87361, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "PCTI"}
