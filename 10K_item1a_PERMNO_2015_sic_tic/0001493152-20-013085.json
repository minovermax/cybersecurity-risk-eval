RISK FACTORS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our business, operations and financial condition to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, those discussed below:\n\u25cf Risks Related to Revenue: Our revenues and our operators\u2019 revenues are dependent, in part, on occupancy. In addition to the impact of increases in mortality rates on occupancy of our operating facilities, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has prevented prospective occupants and their families from visiting our facilities and limited the ability of new occupants to move into our facilities due to heightened move-in criteria and screening. Although the ongoing impact of the pandemic on occupancy remain uncertain, occupancy of our operating and triple-net properties could further decrease. Such a decrease could affect the net operating income of our operating properties and the ability of our triple-net operators to make contractual payments to us.\n\u25cf Risks Related to Operator and Tenant Financial Condition: In addition to the risk of decreased revenue from tenant and operator payments, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic creates a heightened risk of tenant and operator, bankruptcy or insolvency due to factors such as decreased occupancy, medical practice disruptions resulting from stay-at-home orders, increased health and safety and labor expenses or litigation resulting from developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant, demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. A tenant, operator, in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease. In addition, if a lease is rejected in a tenant bankruptcy, our claim against the tenant may be limited by applicable provisions of the bankruptcy law. We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investment property, avoid the imposition of liens on a property and/or transition a property to a new tenant. In some past instances, we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant; however, our ability to do so may be severely limited under current conditions due to the industry and macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or for other reasons, we may take possession of that property, which may expose us to certain successor liabilities. Publicity about the operator\u2019s financial condition and insolvency proceedings, particularly in light of ongoing publicity related to the COVID-19 pandemic, may also negatively impact their and our reputations, decreasing customer demand and revenues. Should such events occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected.\n\u25cf Risks Related to Operations: Across all of our properties, we and our operators have incurred increased operational costs as a result of the introduction of public health measures and other regulations affecting our properties and our operations, as well additional health and safety measures adopted by us and our operators related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including increases in labor and property cleaning expenses and expenditures related to our efforts to procure PPE and supplies on behalf of our operators. Such operational costs may increase in the future based on the duration and severity of the pandemic or the introduction of additional public health regulations. Operators and tenants are also subject to risks arising from the unique pressures on seniors housing and medical practice employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of difficult conditions and stresses related to the COVID-19 pandemic, employee morale and productivity may suffer and additional pay, such as hazard pay, may not be sufficient to retain key operator and tenant employees. In addition, our operations or those of our operators or tenants may be adversely impacted if a significant number of our employees or those of our operators or tenants contract COVID-19. Although we continue to undertake extensive efforts to ensure the safety of our properties, employees and residents and to provide operator support in this regard, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our facilities could result in additional operational costs and reputational and litigation risk to us and our operators. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, operator and tenant cost of insurance is expected to increase and such insurance may not cover certain claims related to COVID-19. Our exposure to COVID-19 related litigation risk may be increased if the operators or tenants of the relevant facilities are subject to bankruptcy or insolvency. In addition, we are facing increased operational challenges and costs resulting from logistical challenges such as supply chain interruptions, business closures and restrictions on the movement of people.\n\u25cf Risks Related to Property Acquisitions and Dispositions: As a result of uncertainty regarding the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the pandemic on our business and related industries, our investments in and acquisitions of senior housing and health care properties, as well as our ability to transition or sell properties with profitable results, may be limited. We have a significant development portfolio and have not experience significant delays or disruptions, but may in the future. Such disruptions to acquisition, disposition and development activity may negatively impact our long-term competitive position.\n\u25cf Risks Related to Liquidity: The COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures implemented by governments worldwide has had severe global macroeconomic impacts and has resulted in significant financial market volatility. An extended period of volatility or a downturn in the financial markets could result in increased cost of capital. If our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase as a result of developments in financial markets relating to the pandemic, our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. In addition, a prolonged period of decreased revenue and limited acquisition and disposition activity operations could adversely affect our financial condition and long-term growth prospects and there can also be no assurance that we will not face credit rating downgrades. Future downgrades could adversely affect our cost of capital, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.\nThe events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our operating and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Report.", "PERMNO": 11561, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "GBCS"}
