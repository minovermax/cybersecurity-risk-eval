{"cik": "1439288", "company": "Zurn Water Solutions Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-09", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe risks described below are not the only risks facing Zurn. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or those risks we currently view to be immaterial, may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, see Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 for a further discussion of some of the factors that could affect future results. If any of these risks materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nStrategic Risks\nOur business and operations, and the operations of our suppliers, business partners and customers, have been, and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, and may be adversely affected by future outbreaks of infectious diseases.\nWe face risks related to the ongoing and unpredictable Covid-19 pandemic, which continues to impact all countries in which we do business and worldwide economic activity generally. The pandemic has resulted, and in the future may result in further widespread or localized health crises that adversely affect general commercial activity and the economies and financial markets of the countries and localities in which we operate, sell, and purchases goods and services. The pandemic, and any similar outbreak of infectious disease, poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, transportation providers, and other business partners may be prevented or impaired from conducting ordinary course business activities for an indefinite period of time, either at specific branches or on a broader scale, including due to shutdowns necessitated for the health and well-being of our employees, the employees of our business partners, or shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. In addition, our suppliers, business partners and customers also experienced similar negative impacts from the Covid-19 pandemic. Global supply chains have been disrupted, causing shortages, which could impact our ability to manufacture or supply our products. Also, we could in the future experience increased compensation expenses associated with employee recruiting and employee retention to the extent employment opportunities continue to multiply post-pandemic, causing the search for and retention of talent to become more competitive. This disruption of our employees, distributors, suppliers and customers has historically impacted and may continue to impact our sales and future operating results.\nThe continued unpredictable ebbing and flowing of new Covid-19 infections worldwide, including new variants, may continue to adversely impact our business, operations, suppliers and customers for the foreseeable future. Equally unpredictable are the responses of national and local governments and health authorities in affected regions to reduce community spread and protect employees, which may include mandatory shutdowns or limitations on all or certain types of business operations. The ultimate impact of the pandemic on our business, depends on the severity, location and duration of outbreaks of Covid-19 and its variants, and the actions of government and health official in response to the outbreaks, none of which is predictable at this time.\nThe markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive; an inability to effectively compete would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets. Some of our competitors have achieved substantially more market penetration in certain of the markets in which we operate. Some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial and other resources than we do, and our competitors may adopt more aggressive sales policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do, all of which could result in a loss of customers and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe compete against both large international and national rivals, as well as many regional competitors. Significant competition in any of the markets in which we operate could result in substantial downward pressure on product pricing and our profit margins, thereby adversely affecting our financial results. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or increase the current market share of our products successfully in the future.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage risks associated with changing technology, product innovation and new product development, manufacturing techniques, distribution channels and business continuity, we may be at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe successful implementation of our business strategy requires us to continuously evolve our existing products and introduce new products to meet customers' needs in the industries we serve. Our products are characterized by stringent performance and specification requirements that mandate a high degree of manufacturing and engineering expertise. If we fail to meet these requirements, our business and ability to compete effectively could suffer. We believe that our customers rigorously evaluate their suppliers on the basis of a number of factors, including product quality, price competitiveness, technical and manufacturing expertise, development and product design capability, new product innovation, reliability and timeliness of delivery, operational flexibility, customer service and overall management. Our ongoing success depends on our\nability to continue to meet our customers' changing specifications with respect to these criteria. We cannot ensure that we will be able to address technological advances or introduce new products that may be necessary to remain competitive within our businesses. Further, such new products and technologies may create additional exposure or risk. We cannot ensure that we can adequately protect our own technological developments to produce a sustainable competitive advantage. Furthermore, we may be subject to business continuity risk in the event of an unexpected loss of a material facility or operation. We cannot ensure that we can adequately protect against such a loss.\nEconomic and financial market weakness, as well as overall challenging market cycles, may particularly impact the industries we serve, and, as a result may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business operations have been adversely affected from time to time by volatility and weaknesses in the global economy and financial markets. While the Covid-19 pandemic has created opportunities in certain areas of our business, the pandemic is expected to continue to adversely affect other areas of our business, though we are unable to predict the extent of the impact due to the uncertainty regarding the duration and severity of the pandemic. Weak, challenging or volatile economic conditions in the end markets, businesses or geographic areas in which we sell our products typically reduces demand for our products and results in a decrease in sales volume.\nOur financial performance depends, in large part, on conditions in the markets that we serve in the U.S. and the global economy generally. Some of the industries we serve are highly cyclical, and some industries have experienced, and are expected to experience, greater pandemic-related impacts than others. Any sustained weakness in demand or downturn or uncertainty in the economy generally, would materially reduce our net sales and profitability.\nFor example, sales to the construction industry are driven by trends in commercial and residential construction, housing starts and trends in residential repair and remodeling. Consumer confidence, employment rates, weather conditions, mortgage rates, credit standards and availability of consumer credit and income levels play a significant role in driving demand in commercial and residential construction, repair and remodeling sector. A drop or weakness in consumer confidence, prolonged adverse weather conditions, lack of availability or increased cost of credit, tightened credit standards or increased unemployment could materially impact demand for and sales of our products and/or result in downward pressure on product pricing and our profit margins, any or all of which could adversely affect our financial results.\nVolatility and disruption of financial markets, including as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, could limit the ability of our customers to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations and may cause them to terminate existing purchase orders, reduce the volume of products they purchase from us in the future or impact their ability to pay their receivables. Adverse economic and financial market conditions may also cause our suppliers to be unable to meet their commitments to us or may cause suppliers to make changes in the credit terms they extend to us, such as shortening the required payment period for outstanding accounts receivable or reducing or eliminating the amount of trade credit available to us.\nAn inability to effectively integrate acquisitions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAcquisitions are part of our growth strategy, and we have completed several in the last few years. We cannot ensure that we will be able to complete any future acquisition, that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business or operations, or that we will be able to accomplish our strategic objectives as a result of any such acquisition.\nAcquisitions are often undertaken to improve the operating results of either or both of the acquirer and the acquired company and we cannot ensure that we will be successful in this regard. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to fully realize the intended benefits from our acquisitions. Acquisitions involve risks, including the possible inability to integrate an acquired business into our operations, potential failure to realize anticipated benefits, diversion of management's attention, issues in customer transitions, potential inadequacies of indemnities and other contractual remedies and unanticipated problems, risks or liabilities, including environmental, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe loss or financial instability of any significant customer or customers accounting for our backlog could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nA substantial part of our business is concentrated with a few customers, and we have certain customers that are significant to our business. During the year ending December 31, 2021, our top five customers accounted for approximately 41% of our consolidated net sales, with one customer accounting for 23% of consolidated net sales. The loss of one or more of these customers or other major customers, or a deterioration in our relationship with any of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur contracted backlog is comprised of future orders for our products from a broad number of customers. Defaults by any of the customers that have placed significant orders with us, whether because of bankruptcy, illiquidity, operational problems or otherwise, could have a significant adverse effect on our net sales, profitability and cash flow. We believe the risk\nof customer default is heightened due to the global economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic although to date we have not experienced a material increase in such defaults due to the pandemic. As of December 31, 2021, all of our backlog was scheduled to ship during the year ending December 31, 2022.\nWe rely on independent distributors and independent sales representatives. Termination of one or more of our relationships with any of our key independent distributors and / or a substantial number of independent representatives, or an increase in their sales of our competitors\u2019 products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe depend on 1,600 independent sales representatives and approximately 60 third-party warehouses to distribute our products. In fiscal 2021, our three largest independent distributors generated approximately 35% of our consolidated net sales with the largest accounting for 23% of consolidated net sales.\nThe loss of one of our key distributors or of a substantial number of our other distributors or independent sales representatives, or an increase in the distributors' sales of competitors' products to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe inability to adequately protect intellectual property, or defend against infringement claims brought against us, could adversely affect our business.\nWe attempt to protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection, as well as third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. We cannot assure that any of our applications for protection of our intellectual property rights will be approved and successfully maintained or that our competitors will not infringe or successfully challenge our intellectual property rights. We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology and trade secrets. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements. We cannot assure that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, our ability to sustain margins on some or all of our products may be affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of our operations, from time to time we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation or are subject to third party litigation claiming infringement, including in respect of some of our more profitable products. An adverse ruling or other unfavorable outcome in any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may be unable to realize intended benefits from our ongoing Supply Chain Optimization and Footprint Repositioning initiatives, restructuring and divestiture efforts, and as a result our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected.\nIn order to operate more efficiently, control costs and refine our business focus, we undertake from time to time restructuring plans, which can include facility consolidations, product rationalizations, workforce reductions and other cost reduction initiatives. From time to time, we also choose to divest operations that we no longer believe are additive or complementary to our business or strategic direction. These plans are intended to reduce operating costs, to modify our footprint to reflect changes in the markets we serve, to reflect changes in business focus, to strengthen focus on our core business and/or to address overall manufacturing overcapacity, including as a result of acquisitions. If we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any other restructuring activities or divestitures that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies, benefits and cost savings might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted.\nIn addition, as a result of such actions, we expect to incur restructuring expenses and other charges (including, for example, potential impairment charges related to fixed assets, goodwill and other intangibles), which may be material, and may exceed our estimates. Several factors could cause restructuring or divestiture activities to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These include potential disruption of our operations, customer relationships and other aspects of our business. Employee morale and productivity could also suffer and may result in unwanted employee attrition. These activities require substantial management time and attention and may divert management from other important work or result in a failure to meet operational targets. Divestitures may also give rise to obligations to buyers or other parties that could have a financial effect after the transaction is completed. Moreover, we could make changes to, or experience delays in executing, any restructuring or divestiture plans, any of which could cause further disruption and additional unanticipated expense.\nTerrorism, conflicts, wars and weather events, as well as other events outside of our control may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risk of damage or disruption to us, our employees, facilities, partners, suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers due to acts of terrorism, political conflicts, wars and weather events, as well as other events outside of our control, such as civil unrest in areas where we have operations. In addition to the issues created by significant weather events, the potential for future attacks, the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security, and other actual or potential actions, conflicts or wars have created, and will continue to create, economic and political uncertainties. In addition, actions against or by the U.S. may particularly impact our business or employees. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, they could result in disruptions to our operations, decreases in demand for our products, difficulty or impossibility in delivering products to our customers or receiving components from our suppliers, delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and risks to our employees, resulting in, among other things, temporarily closed facilities, travel restrictions or longer-term disruptions, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOperational Risks\nIncreases in the cost, and/or the availability, of raw materials, including as a result of tariffs or other trade protection measures, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur manufacturing processes depend on third parties for raw materials, in particular bar steel, brass, castings, copper, forgings, high-performance engineered plastic, plate steel, resin, sheet steel and zinc, as well as petroleum and other carbon-based fuel products. While we strive to maintain alternative sources for most raw materials, our business is subject to the risk of price fluctuations, including as a result of, or in reaction to, tariffs, import duties, or other trade protection measures instituted by the U.S. or other countries, inefficiencies in the event of a need to change our suppliers, and delays in the delivery of and potential unavailability of our raw materials. Also, trade wars or outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, could impact the cost or availability of goods or materials, both imported and domestic, or adversely affect demand for our products. Any such price fluctuations or delays, if material, could harm our profitability or operations. In addition, the loss of a substantial number of suppliers could result in material cost increases or reduce our production capacity. In addition to suppliers we also rely on third party shippers to assist in transportation of our product throughout the supply chain. Availability of transportation and the associated cost increases could have an impact on our profitability or operations.\nWe do not typically enter into hedge transactions to reduce our exposure to purchase price risks and cannot ensure that we would be successful in recouping any increases if these risks were to materialize. In addition, if we are unable to continue to purchase our required quantities of raw materials on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or if we are unable to maintain or enter into new purchase contracts for our larger commodities, our business operations could be disrupted and our profitability could be materially impacted.\nThe ongoing updates to our Enterprise Resource Planning (\"ERP\") systems, as well as failures of our data security and information technology infrastructure or cyber security breaches, could cause substantial business interruptions and/or adversely affect our business.\nUtilizing a phased approach, we continue to update our ERP systems across our Zurn operations. If these updates are ineffective, we could incur substantial business interruptions, including the inability to perform routine business transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Further, these updates may not result in the benefits we intend or be implemented on a timely basis.\nIn addition, we depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to manage our business objectives and operations, support our customers\u2019 requirements and protect sensitive information. There have been significant and increasing instances of data and security breaches, malicious interference with technology systems and industrial espionage involving companies in numerous industries, including cloud providers, and cyber security threats are becoming more complex. Like other companies, we have experienced these types of threats; however, to date, we have not experienced a material threat or incident. In addition, at times a large percentage of our workforce may be working remotely in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which may heighten these risks. While we have taken steps to maintain and enhance our cyber security by implementing additional security technologies, internal controls, network and data center resiliency, redundancy and recovery processes, upgrading our remote work environment and by obtaining insurance coverage, these measures may be inadequate. As a result, any inability by us to successfully manage our information systems, or respond effectively to any attack on or interference with our systems, including matters related to system and data security, privacy, reliability, compliance, performance and access, problems related to our systems caused by natural disasters, security breaches or malicious attacks, and any inability of these systems to fulfill their intended business purpose, could impede our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, account for and collect receivables, protect sensitive data of the Company, our customers, our employees, our suppliers and other business partners, comply with our third party obligations of confidentiality\nand care, or otherwise carry on business in the normal course. Any such events could require costly remediation beyond levels covered by insurance and could cause us to lose customers and/or revenue, including as a result of legal or regulatory claims or proceedings, or damage our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe are also subject to an increasing number of evolving data privacy and security laws and regulations that impose requirements on us. We collect, store, access and otherwise process various types of confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data and other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines, penalties and other costs. For example California\u2019s implementation of its Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and Connected Device Privacy Act of 2018 all could disrupt our ability to sell products or use and transfer data because such activities may not be in compliance with applicable law in certain jurisdictions.\nOur inability to attract and retain key personnel, as well as challenges with respect to the management of human capital resources, in a highly competitive industry may adversely affect our business.\nOur ongoing success depends on our ability to recruit, retain and develop highly skilled management and key personnel, as well as our ability to effectively manage human capital resources. Competition for talented and skilled individuals in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit, train or retain qualified personnel, or to effectively implement successions for existing personnel. If we fail to retain and recruit the necessary personnel or arrange for successors to key personnel, our business could materially suffer.\nIncreased frequency of weather events could disrupt construction activity and adversely affect the demand for our products.\nDemand for our products is primarily driven by commercial construction activity, remodeling and retrofit opportunities, and to a lesser extent, new home starts. Weather is an important variable affecting financial performance as it significantly impacts construction activity. Adverse weather conditions, such as prolonged periods of cold or rain, blizzards, hurricanes and other severe weather patterns, the frequency of which might be affected by climate change, could delay or halt construction and remodeling activity, which could have a negative effect on our business. For example, an unusually severe or prolonged winter can lead to reduced or delayed construction activity which could magnify the seasonal decline in our net sales and earnings during the winter months and hamper the typical seasonal increase in net sales and earnings during the spring months.\nThe long-term effects of climate change could decrease demand for certain of our products.\nClimate change may impact rainfall and water availability in many areas in unpredictable and different ways, which may change the way building owners and municipalities manage drinking, waste and storm water and may lead to new or modified regulations that may impact the market for our products. In certain areas, these changes could lead to a reduction in demand for certain of our water management products, although it also could increase demand for other of our water management products. The overall effect of this could be to reduce our sales and addressable market and/or alter our product sales mix in ways that reduce our margins, either of which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe potential physical impacts of climate change may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in our relevant markets and areas of operation. These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels and changing temperatures. The impacts of climate change may materially and adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of our operations. Further, any impacts to our business and financial condition as a result of climate change are likely to occur over an extended period of time and are therefore difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity. For example, extreme weather events may result in adverse physical effects on portions of our infrastructure, which could disrupt our supply chain and ultimately our business operations. In addition, disruption of transportation and distribution systems could result in reduced operational efficiency and customer service interruption. Climate related events have the potential to disrupt our business, including the business of our suppliers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to resume operations.\nFinancial Risks\nOur debt levels could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, inhibit us from making beneficial acquisitions, adversely impact our ability to implement our capital allocation strategy and prevent us from making debt service payments.\nAs a leveraged company, our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt will depend on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt service and other obligations, and currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements may not be realized on schedule, or at all. If we are unable to meet our expenses and debt service and other obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before\nmaturity, sell assets or raise equity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, sell assets or raise equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur indebtedness could also have other important consequences with respect to our ability to manage and grow our business successfully, including the following:\n\u2022it may limit our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, strategic initiatives, acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u2022it may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under our credit agreement and our other indebtedness;\n\u2022a portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness and so will not be available for other purposes;\n\u2022it may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business, or in taking advantage of strategic opportunities;\n\u2022at times we may be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy;\n\u2022it may restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or divestitures, introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities; and\n\u2022along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness, among other things, may limit our ability to borrow additional funds, make acquisitions or capital expenditures, acquire or dispose of assets or take certain of the actions mentioned above, or adversely impact our ability to implement our capital allocation strategy (which includes paying dividends on our common stock), any of which could restrict our operations and business plans.\nFurthermore, a substantial portion of our indebtedness, including the senior secured credit facilities, bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain short-term prevailing interest rates, including the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"). The United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer persuade or compel panel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR. On March 5, 2021, ICE Benchmark Administration (\u201cIBA\u201d) confirmed it would cease publication of 1 Week and 2 Month USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, but it would not cease publication of Overnight, 1, 3, 6 and 12 Month USD LIBOR settings until immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. The extended cessation date for most USD LIBOR tenors will allow for more time for existing legacy USD LIBOR contracts to mature and provide additional time to continue to prepare for the transition from LIBOR.\nThe Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARCC\u201d), which was convened by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the recommended alternative rate for USD LIBOR. The composition and characteristics of SOFR are not the same as those of LIBOR. SOFR is a broad U.S. Treasury repurchase agreement market financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions. This means that SOFR is fundamentally different from LIBOR in two key respects. First, SOFR is a secured rate, while LIBOR is an unsecured rate. Second, SOFR is an overnight rate, while LIBOR represents interbank funding over different maturities. As a result, there can be no assurance that SOFR or any alternative reference rate will perform in the same way as LIBOR would have at any time, including, without limitation, as a result of changes in interest and yield rates in the market, market volatility or global or regional economic, financial, political, regulatory, judicial or other events.\nThe agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities provides that if LIBOR becomes unavailable, or the Financial Conduct Authority determines that LIBOR is not a representative index, then SOFR will automatically replace LIBOR for all purposes of such agreement. Although the consequences of these developments cannot be predicted at this time, should LIBOR, SOFR, or any other alternative reference rate no longer be available, the rates under our variable rate indebtedness could increase and access to capital could be limited. Additionally, we may continue to be subject to risk on outstanding instruments which rely on LIBOR. For example, if a contract or instrument is not transitioned to a new reference rate and LIBOR ceases to exist, we may experience increased interest rate risk. In addition, we may be dependent on third parties to upgrade their systems, software, and other critical functions to assist in our orderly transition from LIBOR. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information on our debt that is subject to the LIBOR rate.\nAlso, in spite of the limitations in our credit agreement, we may still incur significantly more debt, which could intensify the risks described above on our business, results and financial condition. For more information about our indebtedness, see Item 8, Note 11, Long-Term Debt.\nThe agreements governing our financing arrangements impose certain operating and financial restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur credit agreement contains various covenants that limit or prohibit our ability (subject to certain exceptions), among other things, to:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase, retire or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022make certain loans, acquisitions, capital expenditures or investments;\n\u2022sell certain assets, including stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022create or incur liens;\n\u2022consolidate, merge, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nThese agreements contain covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions, such as incurring additional debt, if we are unable to meet defined specified financial ratios, which could result in limiting our long-term growth prospects by hindering our ability to incur future indebtedness or grow through acquisitions. Failure to comply with certain covenants in these agreements could result in a default. For more information, see Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nThe restrictions contained in the credit agreement could:\n\u2022limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans;\n\u2022restrict our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock and/or adversely impact our ability to implement capital allocation strategy;\n\u2022adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, to enter into strategic acquisitions, to fund investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest; and\n\u2022limit our access to the cash generated by our subsidiaries.\nUpon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit agreement, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the senior secured credit facilities on a first- priority lien basis. If the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, such acceleration could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For a more detailed description of the limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, see Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nOur goodwill and intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets and in excess of our stockholders equity.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our goodwill and intangible assets totaled $254.1 million and $179.1 million, respectively, and represent a substantial portion of our assets. These assets result from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the tangible net assets we have acquired. We assess at least annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes to the use of our assets, changes in the structure of our business, divestitures, market capitalization declines, or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. Any determination requiring the impairment of goodwill or intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations, particularly in the period in which we take any related charges, and financial condition.\nOur required cash contributions to our pension plans may increase further and we could experience a material change in the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and the amount recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to those plans. Additionally, our pension costs could increase in future years.\nThe funded status of the defined benefit pension plans depends on such factors as asset returns, market interest rates, legislative changes and funding regulations. If the returns on the assets of any of our plans were to decline in future periods, if market interest rates were to decline, if the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (\"PBGC\") were to require additional contributions to any such plans as a result of acquisitions or if other actuarial assumptions were to be modified, our future required cash contributions and pension costs to such plans could increase. Any such increases could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe need to make contributions, which may be substantial, to such plans may reduce the cash available to meet our other obligations, including our obligations under our borrowing arrangements or to meet the needs of our business. In addition, the PBGC may terminate our U.S. defined benefit pension plans under limited circumstances, including in the event the PBGC concludes that the risk may increase unreasonably if such plans continue. In the event a U.S. defined benefit pension plan is terminated for any reason while it is underfunded, we could be required to make an immediate payment to the PBGC of all or a substantial portion of such plan's underfunding, as calculated by the PBGC based on its own assumptions (which might result in a larger obligation than that based on the assumptions we have used to fund such plan), and the PBGC could place a lien on material amounts of our assets.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nOur failure to comply with government regulations and requirements, third-party certification requirements and policies and standards driven by our customers or other constituencies, including those related to social responsibility, could adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations.\nIn addition to complying with laws and applicable government regulations and requirements, prevailing industry standards, competitive pressures and/or our customers may require us to comply with further quality, social responsibility, climate-related or other business policies or standards, before customers and prospective customers commence, or continue, doing business with us. These expectations, policies and standards may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations as well as our own pre-existing policies; they may be customer-driven, established by the industry sectors in which we operate or imposed by third-party organizations or other constituencies.\nOur compliance with these policies, standards and third party certification requirements could be costly and could in some cases require us to change the way in which we operate. In addition, if we fail to comply, or if our compliance increases our costs and/or restricts our ability to do business as compared to our competitors that do not adhere to such standards, we could experience an adverse effect on our customer relationships, reputation, operations, cost structure and/or profitability.\nRegulatory and legislative developments related to climate change, may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nA number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes in response to various climate change interest groups and the potential impact of climate change. Legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us and our suppliers, including costs related to increased energy requirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting, and other costs to comply with such regulations. Any future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be addressed, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition, operating performance and ability to compete. Furthermore, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us could harm our reputation. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe are subject to changes in legislative, regulatory and legal developments involving taxes.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal and state, and foreign, income, payroll, property, sales and use, value-added, fuel and other types of taxes. Changes in tax rates, enactment of new tax laws, revisions of tax regulations, and claims or litigation with taxing authorities may require significant judgment in determining the appropriate provision and related accruals for these taxes; and as a result, such changes could result in substantially higher taxes and, therefore, could have a significant adverse effect on our results or operations, financial conditions and liquidity.\nWe may incur significant costs for environmental compliance and/or to address liabilities under environmental laws and regulations, and our reputation may be adversely affected.\nOur operations and facilities worldwide are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to pollution and the protection of the environment, health and safety, including those governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharges to water, the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and other materials, and the remediation of contaminated sites. A failure by us to comply with applicable requirements or the permits required for our operations could result in civil or criminal fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third-party claims for property damage and personal injury, requirements to clean up property or to pay for the costs of cleanup or regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, including the installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions, as well as cause damage to our reputation.\nSome environmental laws and regulations impose requirements to investigate and remediate contamination on present and former owners and operators of facilities and sites, and on potentially responsible parties (\"PRPs\") for sites to which such parties may have sent waste for disposal. Such liability can be imposed without regard to fault and, under certain circumstances, may be joint and several, resulting in one PRP being held responsible for the entire obligation. Liability may also include damages to natural resources. On occasion we are involved in such investigations and/or cleanup, and also have been or could be named as a PRP in environmental matters.\nThe discovery of additional contamination, including at acquired facilities, the imposition of more stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including cleanup requirements, disputes with our insurers or the insolvency of other responsible parties could require us to incur significant capital expenditures or operating costs materially in excess of our accruals. Future investigations we undertake may lead to discoveries of contamination that must be remediated, and decisions to close facilities may trigger remediation requirements that are not currently applicable. We may also face liability for alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to hazardous substances used or disposed of by us, contained within our current or former products, or present in the soil or groundwater at our current or former facilities. We could incur significant costs in connection with such liabilities. See Item 8, Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.\nCertain subsidiaries are subject to litigation, including numerous asbestos and product liability claims, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nCertain subsidiaries are co-defendants in various lawsuits in a number of U.S. jurisdictions alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products. The uncertainties of litigation and the uncertainties related to insurance and indemnification coverage make it difficult to accurately predict the ultimate financial effect of these claims. If our insurance or indemnification coverage is not adequate to cover our potential financial exposure, our insurers dispute their obligations to provider coverage or the actual number or value of asbestos-related claims differs materially from our existing estimates, we could incur material costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, we may be subject to product liability claims if the use of our products, or the exposure to our products or their raw materials, is alleged to have resulted in injury or other adverse effects. We currently maintain product liability insurance coverage but we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain such insurance on commercially reasonable terms in the future, if at all, or that any such insurance will provide adequate coverage against claims. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. In addition, our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed; if this reputation is damaged as a result of a product liability claim, it may be difficult to maintain our pricing positions and market share with respect to our products. Therefore, an unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See Item 8, Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies for additional details.\nRisks Related to the Spin-Off Transaction\nIf the Spin-Off Transaction does not qualify as a tax-free reorganization and distribution for purposes of U.S. federal income taxes, we may be subject to substantial additional taxes.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off Transaction, we obtained a tax opinion and a private letter ruling from the IRS (\u201cIRS Ruling\u201d) as to certain aspects relevant to treatment of the various steps of the transaction as tax-free to us and our shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The tax opinion and IRS Ruling are based on certain factual representations and assumptions and covenants of the parties to the transaction. If any of the factual representations and assumptions are materially false or incorrect, or one or more of the relevant covenants are breached, the validity of the tax opinion and IRS Ruling could be impaired. Furthermore, a tax opinion only represents counsel\u2019s best legal judgment, and is not binding on the IRS or the courts, which may disagree with the opinion.\nIf the IRS determines that some or all of the transactions comprising the Spin-Off Transaction are taxable to us, we and our shareholders at the time of the transaction could be subject to significant additional U.S federal and state income taxes. In certain circumstances, we would be entitled to indemnity from Regal for all or a portion of such additional tax, but there is no assurance that Regal would have the ability to satisfy any such indemnity obligation.\nAs a result of the Spin-Off Transaction, we are subject to certain limitations on Company actions for two years, including certain business combinations, that might otherwise be advantageous.\nUnder relevant agreements governing the Spin-Off Transaction, we are prohibited from taking certain actions during the two-year period following the closing that could cause aspects of the Spin-Off Transaction to fail to qualify for their intended tax treatment. If we breach or are deemed to have breached these restrictions, the tax-free treatment of some or all of the Spin-Off Transaction could be impaired, and we could be subject to substantial additional U.S. federal and state income taxes. These restrictions might interfere with our current business and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities that might be advantageous.\nThe Spin-Off Transaction may not achieve the intended benefits and may expose us to potential risks and liabilities.\nWe undertook the Spin-Off Transaction because, among other things, we believed that the transaction could provide more value to Zurn and Zurn stockholders than other potential strategic options for the Company or our Process and Motion Control business, including a sale of the entire company. We may not benefit as expected from the increased focus on our core Zurn business, strategic programs and objectives made possible by the transaction. In addition, the value realized in the transaction may be reduced by potential liabilities related to post-closing adjustments and indemnities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 13305, "SIC": 3560, "TIC": "RXN"}
