RISK FACTORS\nRisks related to the COVID-19 pandemic\nThe novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) global pandemic could adversely affect our business, operating results, cash flows and financial conditions to an extent that is difficult to predict.\nIn March 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a global pandemic. In the same month, the United States declared a national emergency. Several U.S. states have declared public health emergencies on account of the outbreak and have taken preventative measures to try and contain the spread of COVID-19, including, among other things, \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders. These measures have restricted daily activities of many individuals and caused many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations.\nWe curtailed our investments in land acquisitions and phased development during 2020. These actions may reduce growth and may cause a decline of our lot count and the volume of homes delivered in future periods. Although there are effective vaccines for COVID-19 that have been approved for use, distribution of the vaccines did not begin until late 2020, and a majority of the public will likely not have access to a vaccination until sometime in 2021 or later. Additionally, new strains of COVID-19 are surfacing, and the effectiveness of the approved vaccines on these new strains is unknown. Accordingly, there remains significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including, among other things, on the U.S. economy and consumer confidence. Such impact could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected economies and financial markets across the globe. Although our operations were strong in the second half of 2020, the scale and scope of the ongoing pandemic could heighten the potential adverse effects of the risk factors discussed in this section, including the following factors:\n\u2022A decrease in consumer confidence generally and the confidence of potential homebuyers in particular,\n\u2022Unfavorable general and local economic conditions for our customers, the markets in which we operate and the homebuilding industry generally, including a slowdown or severe downturn in the housing market,\n\u2022Potential delays in home closings or higher rates of cancellations,\n\u2022A significant disruption in service within our operations, including as a result of having to increasingly shift towards a remote selling environment, virtual appointments for house tours and new home demonstrations and \u201ccurbside\u201d or \u201cdrive thru\u201d closings,\n\u2022A disruption to our financial services businesses, including our ability to sell and service the mortgages that we originate, as a result of evolving government regulation, liquidity concerns or otherwise,\n\u2022Increased costs associated with compliance with substantial government regulation, including new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, such as the classification of residential construction as \u201cessential\u201d business in the markets in which we operate and any changes to such classification, which laws or regulations may vary significantly by jurisdiction,\n\u2022Economic and market conditions affecting the value of our land inventory or our option contracts or our investments in unconsolidated entities,\n\u2022An increase in unemployment levels leading to a potential decrease in demand for our homes and/or an increase in the number of loan delinquencies and property repossessions,\n\u2022Disruptions in our business strategy due to our curtailment of non-essential cash expenditures including, but not limited to, temporarily reducing or deferring new land acquisitions, phasing development and implementing a revised cadence on all new inventory homes starts,\n\u2022Increase in the cost or availability of building materials or the availability of subcontractors, vendors or other third parties,\n\u2022Demand from foreign buyers for our homes, particularly due to the widespread impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,\n\u2022Fluctuations in equity market prices, interest rates and credit spreads limiting our ability to raise or deploy capital and affecting our overall liquidity,\n\u2022Significant stock market declines affecting the price of our common stock, and\n\u2022Cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents due to the increased use of remote work environments and virtual platforms.\nAdditionally, we may experience decreased employee productivity, including as a result of division and corporate office team members shifting to a work-from-home protocol. Our operations could be disrupted if key members of our senior management, our directors or a significant percentage of our employees are unable to continue to work because of illness, government directives or otherwise. Additionally, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, increased costs associated with implementing additional personal and workplace safety protocols and employee-related measures, including providing additional paid time off for all field team members and any team members testing positive for COVID-19 and covering out-of-pocket costs for any team members testing positive for COVID-19. We may also encounter delays in responsiveness by governments, municipalities, and other third parties in other matters arising in the ordinary course of business due to their prioritization of matters relating to COVID-19, including but not limited to the timely issuance of building permits, inspections, and entitlement approvals.\nRisks related to our industry, business and economic conditions\nOur business is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions.\nOur business can be substantially affected by adverse changes in general economic or business conditions that are outside of our control, including changes in:\n\u2022short- and long-term interest rates;\n\u2022the availability and cost of financing for homebuyers;\n\u2022federal and state income and real estate tax laws, including limitations on, or the elimination of, the deduction of mortgage interest or property tax payments;\n\u2022employment levels, job and personal income growth and household debt-to-income levels;\n\u2022consumer confidence generally and the confidence of potential homebuyers in particular;\n\u2022the ability of homeowners to sell their existing homes at acceptable prices;\n\u2022the U.S. and global financial systems and credit markets, including stock market and credit market volatility;\n\u2022inclement weather and natural disasters;\n\u2022civil unrest, acts of terrorism, other acts of violence, threats to national security or a public health issue such as COVID-19 or other major epidemic or pandemic;\n\u2022mortgage financing programs and regulation of lending practices;\n\u2022housing demand from population growth, household formations and demographic changes (including immigration levels and trends or other costs of home ownership in urban and suburban migration);\n\u2022demand from foreign buyers for our homes;\n\u2022the supply of available new or existing homes and other housing alternatives;\n\u2022increase in the cost or availability of building materials or the availability of subcontractors, vendors or other third parties,\n\u2022energy prices; and\n\u2022the supply of developable land in our markets and in the United States generally.\nAdverse changes in these conditions may affect our business nationally or may be more prevalent or concentrated in particular regions or localities in which we operate, which effects may be magnified where we have significant operations. Additionally, governmental action and legislation related to economic stimulus, taxation, tariffs, spending levels and borrowing limits, immigration, as well as political debate, conflicts and compromises related to such actions, may negatively impact the financial markets and consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely impact the U.S. economy and the housing market. Any deterioration or significant uncertainty in economic or political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThese adverse changes in economic and other conditions can cause demand and prices for our homes to diminish or cause us to take longer to build our homes and make it more costly for us to do so. We may not be able to recover these increased costs by raising prices because of weak market conditions and because the price of each home we sell is usually set several months before the home is delivered, as many customers sign their home purchase contracts before construction begins. The potential difficulties described above could impact our customers\u2019 ability to obtain suitable financing and cause some homebuyers to cancel or refuse to honor their home purchase contracts altogether.\nA slowdown or severe downturn in the housing market could have additional adverse effects on our operating results and financial condition.\nDuring periods of industry downturn, housing markets across the United States may experience an oversupply of both new and resale home inventory, an increase in foreclosures, reduced levels of consumer demand for new homes, increased cancellation rates, aggressive price competition among homebuilders and increased incentives for home sales. The most recent significant industry downturn that began in 2008 materially and adversely impacted those in the homebuilding industry, including us. In the event of a significant downturn, we may experience a material reduction in revenues, margins, and cash flow. We cannot predict the trajectory of the U.S. housing market. Some housing markets and submarkets have been stronger than others, and there continue to be macroeconomic fluctuations and variability in operating trends, which may be significant and unfavorable.\nIf homebuyers are not able to obtain suitable financing, our results of operations may decline.\nA substantial majority of our homebuyers finance their home purchases through lenders that provide mortgage financing. The availability of mortgage credit may fluctuate due to various factors, including regulatory changes and lower risk appetite by lenders with many lenders requiring increased levels of financial qualification, including those adhering to the currently applicable \u201cQualified Mortgage\u201d requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act. Investors and first-time homebuyers are generally more affected by the availability of financing than other potential homebuyers. A limited availability of home mortgage financing may adversely affect the volume of our home sales and the sales prices we achieve. It could also prevent or limit our ability to attract new customers, our existing customers\u2019 ability to resell their home and/or our ability to fully realize our backlog because our sales contracts may include a financing contingency, which permits the customer to cancel its obligation in the event mortgage financing arranged or provided by us is unobtainable within the period specified in the contract.\nThe liquidity provided by government sponsored entities, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, the FHA and Veterans Administration, to the mortgage industry has been very important to the housing market. If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were dissolved, or if the federal government tightened their borrowing standards or determined to stop providing liquidity support to the mortgage market (including due to any failure of lawmakers to agree on a budget or appropriation legislation to fund relevant programs or operations), there would be a reduction in the availability of the financing provided by these institutions. Any such reduction would likely have an adverse effect on interest rates, mortgage availability and our sales of new homes.\nFHA-insured mortgage loans generally have lower down-payment requirements and qualification standards compared to conventional guidelines and, as a result, the FHA continues to be a particularly important source for financing the sale of our homes. Lenders have taken and may continue to take a more conservative view of FHA guidelines causing significant tightening of borrower eligibility for approval. Under President Trump, FHA-insured loans did not receive a previously scheduled 0.25% rate cut on mortgage insurance premiums. However, President Biden included affordable housing and creating paths to homeownership for lower-income and minority families in his campaign platform, so the President Obama-era 0.25% rate cut may be back on the table. If this, and other FHA-insured loan support, do not come to fruition, however, the availability or affordability of FHA financing could be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our ability to sell homes.\nIn each of our markets, decreases in the availability of credit and increases in the cost of credit adversely affect the ability of homebuyers to obtain or service mortgage debt. Even if potential homebuyers do not themselves need mortgage financing (e.g., potential homebuyers financing their home purchase via a sale of their existing home), increases in mortgage costs, lack of availability of mortgages and/or regulatory changes could prevent the buyers of our potential homebuyers\u2019 existing homes from obtaining a mortgage, which would result in our potential homebuyers\u2019 inability to buy a new home from us. Similar risks apply to those buyers who are awaiting delivery of their homes and are currently in backlog. If our customers (or potential buyers of our customers\u2019 existing homes) cannot obtain suitable financing, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIncreases in interest rates, taxes (or changes in deductibility) or government fees could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results.\nIncreases in interest rates as a result of changes to monetary policy could significantly increase the costs of owning a home or result in existing homeowners with low interest rates choosing to remain in their current homes rather than purchase a new\nhome in a higher interest rate environment. This, in turn, could adversely impact demand for, and sales prices of, homes and the ability of potential customers to obtain financing and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Interest rates have been at historic lows for the last several years, which has made the homes we sell more affordable. During 2020, the Federal Reserve took several steps to protect the economy from the impact of COVID-19, including reducing interest rates to new historic lows. However, we cannot predict whether interest rates will continue to fall or remain low or rise.\nSignificant expenses of owning a home, including mortgage interest and real estate taxes, have historically been deductible expenses for an individual\u2019s U.S. federal and, in some cases, state income taxes, subject to various limitations. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), which was enacted in December 2017, imposed significant limitations with respect to these historical income tax deductions. The impact of the Tax Act or further loss or reduction of these homeowner tax deductions without any offsetting legislation may result in an increase in the total after-tax cost of home ownership and make the purchase of a home less attractive to buyers. This could adversely impact demand for and sales prices of new homes, including ours, particularly in states with higher state income taxes or home prices, such as California.\nAdditionally, increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes. Fees imposed on developers to fund schools, open spaces, road improvements and/or provide low and moderate income housing, could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, increases in sales taxes could adversely affect our potential customers who may consider those costs in determining whether or not to make a new home purchase, potentially reducing our customer base and reducing sales revenue.\nIf we experience shortages in labor supply, increased labor costs or labor disruptions, there could be delays or increased costs in developing our communities or building homes, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe require a qualified labor force to develop our communities and build our homes. Access to qualified labor may be affected by circumstances beyond our control, including work stoppages, changes in laws relating to union organizing activity and increases in subcontractor and professional services costs.\nLabor shortages can be further exacerbated as demand for housing increases. Any of these circumstances could give rise to delays and increased costs developing one or more of our communities and building homes. In addition, the vast majority of our work carried out on site is performed by subcontractors. In the past, reduced levels of homebuilding in the United States has led to some skilled tradesmen leaving the industry to take jobs in other sectors. If subcontractors are not able to recruit sufficient numbers of skilled employees, our development and construction activities may suffer from delays and quality issues, which would also lead to reduced levels of customer satisfaction. Further, the cost of labor may also be adversely affected by changes in immigration laws and trends in labor migration. We may not be able to recover increased costs by raising our home prices because the price for each home is typically set months prior to its delivery pursuant to sales contracts with our homebuyers. In such circumstances, our operating results could be adversely affected. Additionally, market and competitive forces may also limit our ability to raise the sales prices of our homes.\nHigher cancellation rates of existing agreements of sale may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur backlog represents sales contracts with our homebuyers for homes that have not yet been delivered. We have received a deposit from a homebuyer for each home reflected in our backlog and, generally, we have the right, subject to certain exceptions, to retain the deposit if the homebuyer fails to comply with his or her obligations under the sales contract, including as a result of state and local law, the homebuyer\u2019s inability to sell his or her current home or the homebuyer\u2019s inability to make additional deposits required prior to the closing date. In some situations, however, a homebuyer may cancel the agreement of sale and receive a complete or partial refund of the deposit.\nIf, for example, prices for new homes decline, competitors increase their use of sales incentives, interest rates increase, the availability of mortgage financing diminishes, current homeowners find it difficult to sell their current homes or there is a downturn in local or regional economies or in the national economy, U.S. homebuyers may choose to terminate their existing home purchase contracts with us in order to negotiate for a lower price or because they cannot, or will not, complete the purchase and our remedies generally do not extend beyond the retention of deposits as our liquidated damages.\nIn cases of cancellation, we remarket the home and retain any deposits we are permitted to retain. Nevertheless, the deposits may not cover the additional costs involved in remarketing the home, replacing or modifying installed options, reducing the sales price or increasing incentives on the completed home for greater marketability and carrying higher inventory. Further, depending on the stage of cancellation, a contract that is cancelled at the end of a phase may cause additional costs for the out of sequence construction or modification of the particular home. Significant numbers of cancellations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe homebuilding and mortgage and title services industries are highly competitive and if our competitors are more successful or offer better value to our customers, our business could decline.\nWe operate in a very competitive environment with competition from a number of other homebuilders in each of our markets. We compete with large national and regional homebuilding companies and with smaller local homebuilders for land, financing and related services, raw materials, skilled management, volume discounts, local realtor and labor resources. We also compete with the resale, or \u201cpreviously owned,\u201d home market, as well as other housing alternatives such as the rental housing market. Additionally, some of our competitors have longstanding relationships with subcontractors and suppliers in markets in which we operate and others may have significantly greater financial resources or lower costs than us. Competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry could make it difficult for us to acquire suitable land at acceptable prices, cause us to increase selling incentives, reduce prices and/or result in an oversupply of homes for sale. These factors have adversely affected demand for our homes and our results of our operations in the past and could do so again in the future.\nAdditionally, our mortgage and title services businesses compete with other mortgage lenders and title companies, including national, regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions, some of which may be subject to fewer government regulations or, in the case of mortgage lenders, may have a greater range of products, greater access to or a lower cost of capital or different lending criteria and may be able to offer more attractive financing to potential customers.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively in our homebuilding and mortgage and title services markets, our business could decline disproportionately to our competitors, and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAny increase in unemployment or underemployment may lead to an increase in the number of loan delinquencies and property repossessions and have an adverse impact on us.\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (\u201cBLS\u201d), the U.S. unemployment rate was 6.3% as of January 2021, and the labor force participation rate has declined from 66.2% in January 2008 to 61.4% in January 2021. These statistics potentially reflect the impact of COVID-19 as workers leave the labor force entirely. In addition, a substantial portion of new jobs created have been relatively low-wage jobs or part-time jobs. People who are not employed, are underemployed, who have left the labor force or are concerned about low wages or the loss of their jobs are less likely to purchase new homes, may be forced to try to sell the homes they own and may face difficulties in making required mortgage payments. Therefore, any increase in unemployment or underemployment may lead to an increase in the number of loan delinquencies and property repossessions and have an adverse impact on us both by reducing demand for the homes we build and by increasing the supply of homes for sale.\nInflation or deflation could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nInflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land, materials and labor. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which historically has had a negative impact on housing demand, as well as increasing the interest rates we may need to pay for our own capital financing. In such an environment, we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation, and our margins could decrease. An oversupply of homes relative to demand and home prices being set several months before homes are delivered may make any price increase difficult or impossible. Efforts by the government to stimulate the economy may increase the risk of significant inflation and its adverse impact on our business or financial results.\nDeflation could also affect us adversely. A significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels. This could lead to a further deterioration in economic conditions, including an increase in the rate of unemployment. Deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance, which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes and have a negative impact on demand and our results of operations.\nFurthermore, a material decline in oil and gas prices may increase the risk of significant deflation and its adverse impact on our business or financial results, as the economies of some of the markets in which we operate are impacted by the health of the energy industry.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate because of the seasonal nature of our business and other factors.\nOur quarterly operating results generally fluctuate by season as a result of a variety of factors such as the timing of home deliveries and land sales, the changing composition and mix of our asset portfolio, and weather-related issues.\nWeather-related problems, typically in the fall, late winter and early spring, may delay starts or closings and increase costs and thus reduce profitability. In some cases, we may not be able to recapture increased costs by raising prices. In addition, deliveries\nmay be staggered over different periods of the year and may be concentrated in particular quarters. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate because of these factors. See Item 1 - Business - Seasonality.\nPhysical impacts of climate change could increase our costs and/or otherwise adversely impact our operations.\nSome of our business is in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the physical impacts of climate change, such as from the increased frequency and severity of storms, flooding, sustained rainfall, wildfires, and drought. For example, winter storms and unseasonably cold weather in Texas, recently left millions in the state without electricity and have significantly impacted utility prices in the area. Such severe weather events can delay home construction, increase costs by damaging inventories, reduce the availability of building materials, and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas, as well as slow down or otherwise impair the ability of utilities and local governmental authorities to provide approvals and service to new housing communities. Furthermore, if our insurance does not fully cover our costs and other losses from these events, including those arising out of related business interruptions, our earnings, liquidity, or capital resources could be adversely affected.\nAn inability to obtain additional performance, payment and completion surety bonds and letters of credit could limit our future growth.\nWe are often required to provide performance, payment and completion and warranty/maintenance surety bonds or letters of credit to secure the completion of our construction contracts, development agreements and other arrangements. We believe we have obtained credit facilities to provide the required volume of such surety bonds and letters of credit for our expected growth in the medium term. However, unexpected growth may require additional facilities. We may also be required to renew or amend our existing facilities. Our ability to obtain additional performance, payment and completion and warranty/maintenance surety bonds and letters of credit primarily depends on our credit rating, capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise and certain external factors, including the fluidity of the markets for such bonds. Performance, payment and completion and warranty/maintenance surety bond and letter of credit providers consider these factors in addition to our performance and claims record and provider-specific underwriting standards, which may change from time to time.\nIf our performance record or our providers\u2019 requirements or policies change, if we cannot obtain the necessary renewals or amendments from our lenders, or if the market\u2019s capacity to provide performance, payment and completion or warranty/maintenance bonds or letters of credit is not sufficient for any unexpected growth, we could be unable to obtain such bonds or letters of credit from other sources when required, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHomebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can lead to significant costs for us.\nAs a homebuilder, we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Construction defects may occur on projects and developments and may arise a significant period of time after completion. Unexpected expenditures attributable to defects or previously unknown sub-surface conditions arising on a development project may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs a consequence, we maintain products and completed operations excess liability insurance, obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors generally covering claims related to damages resulting from faulty workmanship and materials and maintain warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the risks associated with the types of homes built. Although we actively monitor our insurance reserves and coverage, because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage, our subcontractor's indemnity and warranty arrangements and our reserves together will be adequate to address all of our warranty and construction defect claims in the future. For example, we record changes in estimates to pre-existing reserves as needed. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a $43.1 million charge for construction defect remediation isolated to one specific community in the Central region. For the year ended December 31, 2020, no changes in estimates were necessary for this construction defect remediation. This reserve at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $12.7 million and $36.3 million, respectively. The reserve estimate is based on assumptions, including but not limited to, the number of homes affected, the costs associated with each repair, and the effectiveness of the repairs. Due to the degree of judgment required in making these estimates and the inherent uncertainty in potential outcomes, it is reasonably possible that actual costs could differ from those recorded and such differences could be material, resulting in a change in future estimated reserves. In addition, contractual indemnities with our subcontractors can be difficult to enforce. We may also be responsible for applicable self-insured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits. Additionally, the coverage offered by and the availability of products and completed operations excess liability insurance for construction defects is currently limited and costly. This coverage may be further restricted or become more costly in the future.\nIn California we operate under an Owner Controlled Insurance Plan (\u201cOCIP\u201d) for general liability exposures of most subcontractors (excluding consultants), as a result of the inability of subcontractors to procure acceptable insurance coverage to meet our requirements. Under the OCIP, subcontractors are effectively insured by us. We have assigned risk retentions and bid deductions to our subcontractors based on their risk category. These deductions are used to fund future liabilities. The cost of the future liabilities as they are realized could exceed the value of the deductions, which could increase our costs leading to a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur reliance on subcontractors can expose us to various liability risks.\nWe rely on subcontractors in order to perform the construction of our homes and, in many cases, to select and obtain raw materials. We are exposed to various risks as a result of our reliance on these subcontractors and their suppliers. The subcontractors we rely on to perform the actual construction of our homes are also subject to a significant and evolving number of local, state and federal laws and regulations, including laws involving matters that are not within our control. If these subcontractors who construct our homes fail to comply with all applicable laws, we can suffer reputational damage and may be exposed to liability.\nThese subcontractors are independent from us under normal homebuilding industry practices. We do not have the ability to control what these independent subcontractors pay or the work rules they impose on their employees. However, various federal and state governmental agencies have sought, and may in the future seek, to hold contracting parties like us responsible for our subcontractors\u2019 violations of wage and hour laws, or workers\u2019 compensation, collective bargaining and/or other employment-related obligations related to subcontractors\u2019 workforces. Governmental agency determinations or attempts by others to make us responsible for our subcontractors\u2019 labor practices or obligations could create substantial adverse exposure for us in situations that are not within our control and could be material to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to manage land acquisitions, inventory and development and construction processes could result in significant cost overruns or errors in valuing sites.\nWe own and purchase a large number of sites each year and are therefore dependent on our ability to process a very large number of transactions which include, among other things, evaluating the site purchase, designing the layout of the development, sourcing materials and subcontractors and managing contractual commitments efficiently and accurately.\nIn addition, we incur many costs even before we begin to build homes in a community. Depending on the stage of development of a land parcel when we acquire it, these may include: costs of preparing land, finishing and entitling lots, installing roads, sewers, water systems and other utilities, taxes and other costs related to ownership of the land on which we plan to build homes; constructing model homes; and promotional and marketing expenses to prepare for the opening of a new home community for sales. Moreover, local municipalities may impose development-related requirements resulting in additional costs. If the rate at which we sell and deliver homes slows or falls, or if our opening of new home communities for sale is delayed, we may incur additional costs, which would adversely affect our gross profit margins and will lead to a longer period of time for us to recover our costs, including those we incurred in acquiring and developing land.\nIn certain circumstances, a grant of entitlements or development agreement with respect to a particular parcel of land may include restrictions on the transfer of such entitlements to a buyer of such land, which may increase our exposure to decreases in the price of such entitled land by restricting our ability to sell it for its full entitled value. In addition, inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in reduced margins or losses in a poorly performing community or market. Further, if we were required to record a significant inventory impairment, it could negatively affect our reported earnings per share and negatively impact the market perception of our business.\nIf land and lots are not available at competitive prices, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur long-term profitability depends in large part on the price at which we are able to obtain suitable land and lots for the development of our communities. Increases in the price (or decreases in the availability) of suitable land and lots could adversely affect our profitability. Moreover, changes in the general availability of desirable land, geographical or topographical constraints, competition for available land and lots, limited availability of financing to acquire land and lots, zoning regulations that limit housing density, environmental requirements and other market conditions may hurt our ability to obtain land and lots for new communities at prices that will allow us to be profitable. If the supply of land and lots that are appropriate for development of our communities becomes more limited because of these or any other reason, the cost of land and lots could increase and the number of homes that we are able to build and sell could be reduced, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the market value of our land inventory decreases, our results of operations could be adversely affected by impairments and write-downs.\nThe market value of our land and housing inventories depends on market conditions. We acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets, and there is often a significant lag time between when we acquire land for development and when we sell homes in our communities. This risk is exacerbated particularly with undeveloped and/or unentitled land.\nThere is an inherent risk that the value of the land owned by us may decline after purchase. The valuation of property is inherently subjective and based on the individual characteristics of each property. We may have acquired options on or bought and developed land at a cost we will not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot build and sell homes profitably. In addition, our deposits for lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk, and depressed land values may cause us to abandon and forfeit deposits on land option contracts and other similar contracts if we cannot satisfactorily renegotiate the purchase price of the subject land. Moreover, all valuations are made on the basis of assumptions that may not prove to reflect economic or demographic reality. If housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory, our profitability may be adversely affected and we may not be able to recover our costs when we build and sell houses. In addition, we may incur charges against our earnings for inventory impairments if the value of our owned inventory, including land we decide to sell, is reduced or for land option contract abandonments if we choose not to exercise land option contracts or other similar contracts, and these charges may be substantial.\nWe may not be able to use certain deferred tax assets, which may result in our having to pay substantial taxes.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets, including net operating losses that could be used to offset earnings and reduce the amount of taxes we are required to pay. Our ability to use our net operating losses is dependent on a number of factors, including applicable rules relating to the permitted carry back period for offsetting certain net operating losses against prior period earnings and the timing and amount of future taxable income. If we are unable to use our net operating losses, we may have to record charges to reduce our deferred tax assets, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRaw materials and building supply shortages and price fluctuations could delay or increase the cost of home construction and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe homebuilding industry has, from time to time, experienced raw material shortages and been adversely affected by volatility in global commodity prices. In particular, shortages and fluctuations in the price of concrete, drywall, lumber or other important raw materials could result in delays in the start or completion of, or increase the cost of, developing one or more of our residential communities. Our lumber needs are particularly sensitive to shortages. In addition, the cost of petroleum products, which are used both to deliver our materials and to transport workers to our job sites, fluctuates and may be subject to increased volatility as a result of geopolitical events, catastrophic storms, other severe weather or significant environmental accidents. Environmental laws and regulations may also have a negative impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber and concrete. Additionally, pricing for raw materials may be affected by various other national, regional and local economic and political factors. For example, in recent years the federal government has imposed new or increased tariffs or duties on an array of imported materials and goods that are used in connection with the construction and delivery of our homes, including steel, aluminum and lumber, raising our costs for these items (or products made with them). Such government imposed tariffs and trade regulations on imported building supplies may in the future have significant impacts on the cost to construct our homes, including by causing disruptions or shortages in our supply chain and/or negatively impacting the U.S. regional or local economies. Additionally, we may be unable to pass increases in construction costs on to our customers who may have already entered into purchase contracts.\nWe have significant operations in certain geographic areas, which subjects us to an increased risk of lost revenue or decreases in the market value of our land and homes in these regions from factors which may affect any of these regions.\nWe currently operate in several states with a concentration in the west coast and a significant presence in California. Negative factors affecting one or a number of the geographic regions at the same time could result in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of operations. To the extent that regions in which our business is concentrated are impacted by an adverse event, we could be disproportionately affected compared to companies whose operations are less geographically concentrated.\nWe participate in certain unconsolidated joint ventures, including those in which we do not have a controlling interest, where we may be adversely impacted by the failure of the unconsolidated joint venture or the other partners in the unconsolidated joint venture to fulfill their obligations.\nWe have investments in and commitments to certain unconsolidated joint ventures with related and unrelated strategic partners to acquire and develop land and, in some cases, build and deliver homes. To finance these activities, our unconsolidated joint ventures often obtain loans from third-party lenders that are secured by the unconsolidated joint venture\u2019s assets. To the extent\nany of our joint ventures default on obligations secured by the assets of such joint venture, the assets could be forfeited to third-party lenders.\nWe have provided non-recourse carve-out guarantees to certain third-party lenders to our unconsolidated joint ventures (i.e., guarantees of losses suffered by the lender in the event that the borrowing entity or its equity owners engage in certain conduct, such as fraud, misappropriation of funds, unauthorized transfers of the financed property or equity interests in the borrowing entity, or the borrowing entity commences a voluntary bankruptcy case, or the borrowing entity violates environmental law, or hazardous materials are located on the property, or under other circumstances provided for in such guarantee or indemnity). In the future, we may provide other guarantees and indemnities to such lenders, including secured guarantees, in which case we may have increased liability in the event that a joint venture defaults on its obligations to a third party.\nIf the other partners in our unconsolidated joint ventures do not provide such cooperation or fulfill these obligations due to their financial condition, strategic business interests (which may be contrary to ours), or otherwise, we may be required to spend additional resources (including payments under the guarantees we have provided to the unconsolidated joint ventures\u2019 lenders) or suffer losses, each of which could be significant. Moreover, our ability to recoup such expenditures and losses by exercising remedies against such partners may be limited due to the contractual terms of the joint venture agreement, potential legal defenses they may have, their respective financial condition and other circumstances. Furthermore, because we lack a controlling interest in our unconsolidated joint ventures we cannot exercise sole decision-making authority, which could create the potential risk of impasses on decisions and prevent the joint venture from taking, or not taking, actions that we believe may be in our best interests. In addition, as our relationships with our partners are contractual in nature and may be terminated or dissolved under the terms of the applicable joint venture agreements, including buy-sell provisions, we may not continue to own or operate the interests or assets underlying such relationship or may need to purchase additional interests or assets in the venture to continue ownership. In the event a joint venture is terminated or dissolved, we could also be exposed to lawsuits and legal costs.\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.\nWe use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities as well as maintain our business records, including information provided by our customers. Many of these resources are provided to us and/or maintained on our behalf by third-party service providers pursuant to agreements that specify certain security and service level standards. Our ability to conduct our business may be impaired if these resources are compromised, degraded, damaged or fail, whether due to a virus or other harmful circumstance, intentional penetration or disruption of our information technology resources by a third party, natural disaster, hardware or software corruption, failure or error (including a failure of security controls incorporated into or applied to such hardware or software), telecommunications system failure, service provider error or failure, intentional or unintentional personnel actions (including the failure to follow our security protocols), or lost connectivity to our networked resources. A significant and extended disruption in the functioning of these resources could impair our operations, damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, sales and revenue.\nPrivacy, security, and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved. As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain confidential information, including personal information of homebuyers/borrowers and information about employees, vendors and suppliers. While we have implemented systems and processes intended to secure our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive, confidential and personal data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies, and have increased our monitoring capabilities to enhance early detection and rapid response to potential security anomalies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all possible occurrences and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. Further, development and maintenance of these measures are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated. Our failure to maintain the security of the data we are required to protect could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also in deterioration in customers\u2019 confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may incur a variety of costs to engage in future growth or expansion of our operations or acquisitions of businesses, and the anticipated benefits may never be realized.\nAs a part of our business strategy, we may make acquisitions, or significant investments in, businesses. Any future acquisitions, investments and/or disposals would be accompanied by risks such as:\n\u2022difficulties in assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies or businesses;\n\u2022diversion of our management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022our potential inability to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful incorporation or disposition of operations;\n\u2022significant liabilities may not be identified in due diligence or may come to light after the expiry of warranty or indemnity periods;\n\u2022implementation of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; and\n\u2022impairment of existing relationships with employees, contractors, suppliers and customers as a result of the integration of new management personnel and cost-saving initiatives.\nAcquisitions can result in dilution to existing stockholders if we issue our Common Stock as consideration, or reduce our liquidity if we fund them with cash. In addition, acquisitions can expose us to valuation risks, including the risk of writing off goodwill or impairing inventory and other assets related to such acquisitions. The risk of goodwill and asset impairments will increase during a cyclical housing downturn when our profitability may decline.\nDispositions have their own risks associated with the separation of operations and personnel, the potential provision of transition services and the allocation of management resources. Dispositions may also result in lost synergies that could negatively impact our balance sheet, income statement and cash flows. Additionally, while we would seek to limit our ongoing exposure, for example, through liability caps and time limits on warranties and indemnities, some warranties and indemnities may give rise to unexpected and significant liabilities. Any claims arising in the future may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We may not able to manage the risks associated with these transactions and the effects of such transactions, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may have difficulty managing the integrated businesses of Taylor Morrison and William Lyon Homes, and the anticipated benefits of the combined company may not be realized.\nOn February 6, 2020, we completed our acquisition of William Lyon Homes. The ultimate success of Taylor Morrison\u2019s acquisition of William Lyon Homes will depend in large part on the success of the management of the combined company following the integration of operations, strategies, technologies and personnel of the two companies. As of December 31, 2020, the integration of operations and personnel were substantially complete. The integration of technologies and strategies will continue throughout 2021. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the merger if the remaining integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in managing the integrated business of our combined company or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the merger, including additional cost savings and synergies, could impair our operations.\nPotential difficulties we may encounter in the management of the combined company:\n\u2022the increased costs and complexity associated with monitoring our operations, including due to the significantly increased size of our combined company;\n\u2022the failure to realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, and other benefits initially anticipated with the merger;\n\u2022the integration of strategies and technologies;\n\u2022the retention of and possible decrease in business from the existing customers of our combined company;\n\u2022the retention of key employees; and\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities associated with the merger.\nA major health and safety incident relating to our business could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage.\nBuilding sites are inherently dangerous and pose certain inherent health and safety risks to construction workers and other persons on the site. Due to health and safety regulatory requirements and the number of projects we work on, health and safety performance is critical to the success of all areas of our business. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities incurred as a result. Such a failure could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation, our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies or governmental authorities, and our ability to attract customers and employees, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOwnership or occupation of land and the use of hazardous materials carries potential environmental risks and liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, rules and regulations concerning land use and the protection of health and the environment, including those governing discharge of pollutants to water and air, stormwater run-off, the presence of and exposure to asbestos, the handling of hazardous materials and the cleanup of contaminated structures and properties. Further, some environmental laws (including many addressing releases of hazardous substances) impose strict liability, which\nmeans that we may be held liable for environmental conditions on property we own, or previously owned, which we did not create or know about, or which resulted from conduct that was lawful. Contamination or other environmental conditions at or in the vicinity of our developments could also result in claims against us for personal injury, property damage or other losses. Such liabilities, and the costs of defending against such claims, may be substantial, and insurance coverage may be limited or non-existent. The presence of such substances at or in the vicinity of our properties, or the failure to remediate such substances properly, may also adversely affect our ability to sell the affected land or to borrow using it as security. Environmental impacts from historical activities have been identified at some of the projects we have developed in the past and additional projects may be located on land that may have been contaminated by previous use.\nNegative publicity or poor relations with the residents of our communities could negatively impact sales, which could cause our revenues or results of operations to decline.\nUnfavorable media or investor and analyst reports related to our industry, company, brands, marketing, personnel, operations, business performance, or prospects may affect our stock price and the performance of our business, regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy. Our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment. Adverse publicity or negative commentary on social media outlets, such as blogs, websites or newsletters, could hurt operating results, as consumers might avoid or protest brands that receive bad press or negative reviews. Customers and other interested parties could act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy. Accordingly, we could suffer immediate harm without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\nIn addition, we can be affected by poor relations with the residents of communities we develop because these residents sometimes look to us to resolve issues or disputes that may arise in connection with the operation or development of their communities. Efforts made by us to resolve these issues or disputes could be deemed unsatisfactory by the affected residents and subsequent actions by these residents could adversely affect sales or our reputation. In addition, we could decide or be required to make material expenditures related to the settlement of such issues or disputes or to modify our community development plans, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nLegal and regulatory risks.\nGovernment regulations and legal challenges may delay the start or completion of our communities, increase our expenses or limit our homebuilding or other activities, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nThe approval of numerous governmental authorities must be obtained in connection with our development and construction activities, and these governmental authorities often have broad discretion in exercising their approval authority. We incur substantial costs related to compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Any increase in legal and regulatory requirements may cause us to incur substantial additional costs, or in some cases cause us to determine that a property is not feasible for development. Various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning building, health and safety, site and building design, environment, zoning, sales and similar matters apply to and/or affect the housing industry. In addition, our ability to obtain or renew permits or approvals and the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained depends on factors beyond our control, such as changes in federal, state and local policies, rules and regulations and their interpretations and application. Furthermore, we are also subject to various fees and charges of government authorities designed to defray the cost of providing certain governmental services and improvements. For example, local and state governments have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects under their jurisdictions, as well as requiring concessions or that the builder construct certain improvements to public places such as parks and streets or fund schools.\nFurther, government agencies routinely initiate audits, reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant. Further, we may experience delays and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed communities, whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties.\nRegulations regarding environmental matters and climate change may affect us by substantially increasing our costs and exposing us to potential liability.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, which may affect aspects of our operations such as how we manage stormwater runoff, wastewater discharges and dust; how we develop or operate on properties on or affecting resources such as wetlands, endangered species, cultural resources, or areas subject to preservation laws; and how we address contamination.\nDevelopers and homebuilders may become subject to more stringent requirements under such laws. For example, the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\u201cArmy Corps\u201d) have been engaged for years in\nrulemakings to clarify the scope of federally regulated wetlands, which included a June 2015 rule that many affected interests contend impermissibly expanded the scope of such wetlands. That rule was challenged in court and remains in litigation; and a series of rulemakings under the Trump administration designed to roll back the June 2015 rule and replace it with a less expansive rule culminated in the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, which went into effect in June 2020 (except in Colorado, where a federal district court issued a preliminary injunction against application of the rule in that state). The new rule has been challenged in several court proceedings by a number of states and environmental advocacy organizations opposing the narrower scope of the rule, and in several other court proceedings by cattlemen and other rancher groups contending that the new rule is still impermissibly expansive. More recently, one of the executive orders signed by President Biden on day one requires a review of certain environmental and health regulations, including the Navigable Waters Protection Rule. The administration may request the courts to stay pending litigation regarding the waters of the U.S., and courts may do so or may set aside the requests and allow the lawsuits to continue. It is unclear how these and related developments, including at the state or local level, ultimately may affect the scope of regulated wetlands where we operate. Although we cannot reliably predict the extent of any effect these developments regarding wetlands, or any other environmental requirements that may take effect may have on us, they could result in time-consuming and expensive compliance programs and in substantial expenditures, which could cause delays and increase our cost of operations. Our noncompliance with environmental laws could result in fines and penalties, obligations to remediate, permit revocations and other sanctions.\nIn addition, there is a growing concern from advocacy groups and the general public that the emission of greenhouse gases and other human activities have caused, or will cause, significant changes in weather patterns and temperatures and the frequency and severity of natural disasters. There is a variety of legislation and other regulation being implemented or considered, at the federal, state and local level relating to energy and climate change. It involves matters including carbon dioxide emissions control and building codes that impose energy efficiency standards, as well as standards to improve the resiliency of buildings to climate-related impacts such as flooding, storm surges, severe winds, wildfires and other extreme weather-related stress on buildings. Such requirements could significantly increase our cost to construct homes. Energy-related initiatives affect a wide variety of companies throughout the United States and the world and, because our operations are heavily dependent on significant amounts of raw materials, such as lumber, steel and concrete, they could also have an indirect adverse impact on our operations and profitability to the extent the manufacturers and suppliers of our materials are burdened with expensive cap and trade and similar energy related taxes and regulations.\nWe may face substantial damages or be enjoined from pursuing important activities as a result of existing or future litigation, arbitration or other claims.\nWe are involved in various litigation and legal claims in the normal course of our business operations, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. We establish liabilities for legal claims and regulatory matters when such matters are both probable of occurring and any potential loss is reasonably estimable. We accrue for such matters based on the facts and circumstances specific to each matter and revise these estimates as the matters evolve. In such cases, there may exist an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts currently accrued. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of these legal and regulatory matters, we generally cannot predict the ultimate resolution, the related timing or any eventual loss. To the extent the liability arising from the ultimate resolution of any matter exceeds the estimates reflected in the recorded reserves relating to such matter, we could incur additional charges that could be significant. Unfavorable litigation, arbitration or claims could also generate negative publicity in various media outlets that could be detrimental to our reputation.\nUtility and resource shortages or rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nSeveral of the markets in which we operate have historically been subject to utility and resource shortages, including significant changes to the availability of electricity and water. Shortages of utility resources and natural resources in our markets, particularly of water, may make it more difficult for us to obtain regulatory approval of new developments and have other adverse implications.\nFor example, certain areas in which we operate, particularly the Western United States, have experienced and continue to experience severe drought conditions. In response to these conditions, government officials often take a number of steps to preserve potable water supplies. To address the state\u2019s mandate and their own available potable water supplies, local water agencies/suppliers could potentially: restrict, delay the issuance of, or proscribe new water connection permits for homes; increase the costs for securing such permits, either directly or by requiring participation in impact mitigation programs; adopt higher efficiency requirements for water-using appliances or fixtures; limit or ban the use of water for construction activities; impose requirements as to the types of allowed plant material or irrigation for outdoor landscaping that are more strict than state standards and less desired by consumers; and/or impose fines and penalties for noncompliance with any such measures. These local water agencies/suppliers could also increase rates and charges to residential users for the water they use, potentially increasing the cost of homeownership.\nAny of the foregoing, individually or collectively, could adversely affect the regional economies in which we operate, which may limit, impair or delay our ability to acquire and develop land and/or build and deliver homes, increase our production costs or reduce demand for our homes, thereby negatively affecting our business and results of operations.\nRisks related to our financial services business.\nOur financial services businesses are subject to risks, including risks associated with our ability to sell mortgages we originate and to claims on loans sold to third parties.\nWhile we intend for the loans originated by TMHF, our financial services business, to be sold on the secondary market, if TMHF is unable to sell loans into the secondary mortgage market or directly to large secondary market loan purchasers such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, TMHF would bear the risk of being a long-term investor in these originated loans. Being required to hold loans on a long-term basis would subject us to credit risks associated with the borrowers to whom the loans are extended, would negatively affect our liquidity and could require us to use additional capital resources to finance the loans that TMHF is extending. In addition, although mortgage lenders under the mortgage warehouse facilities TMHF currently uses to finance our lending operations normally purchase our mortgages within approximately 20-30 days of origination, if such mortgage lenders default under these warehouse facilities TMHF would be required to fund the mortgages then in the pipeline. In such case, amounts available under our Revolving Credit Facility and cash from operations may not be sufficient to allow TMHF to provide financing required by our business during these times, and our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans at competitive prices could be limited, which could negatively affect our business. Further, an obligation to commit our own funds to long-term investments in mortgage loans could, among other things, delay the time when we recognize revenues from home sales on our statements of operations.\nOur financial services businesses may also be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors (including loans originated by companies we have acquired) in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties made to secondary market purchasers that the loans sold meet certain requirements, including representations as to underwriting standards, the type of collateral, the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan. Accordingly, mortgage investors could seek to have us buy back loans or compensate them for losses incurred on mortgages sold based on claims that we breached our limited representations or warranties. If, due to higher costs, reduced liquidity, residential consumer loan putback demands or internal or external reviews of its residential consumer mortgage loan foreclosure processes, or other factors or business decisions, TMHF is unable to make loan products available to our homebuyers, our home sales and financial services results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe enter into interest rate lock commitments (\u201cIRLCs\u201d) to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale, at specified interest rates and within a specified period of time (generally between 30 and 60 days), with customers who have applied for a loan and meet certain credit and underwriting criteria. These commitments expose us to market risk if interest rates change and the underlying loan is not economically hedged or committed to an investor. We also have exposure to credit loss in the event of contractual non-performance by our trading counterparties in derivative instruments that we use in our rate risk management activities. We aim to manage this credit risk by selecting only counterparties that we believe to be financially strong, spreading the risk among multiple counterparties, by placing contractual limits on the amount of unsecured credit extended to any single counterparty, and by entering into netting agreements with counterparties, as appropriate.\nOur financial services and title services businesses may be adversely affected by changes in governmental regulation.\nChanges in governmental regulation with respect to mortgage lenders and title service providers could adversely affect the financial results of this portion of our business. Our financial services businesses are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, which, among other things: prohibit discrimination and establish underwriting guidelines; provide for audits and inspections; require appraisals and/or credit reports on prospective borrowers and disclosure of certain information concerning credit and settlement costs; establish maximum loan amounts; prohibit predatory lending practices; and regulate the referral of business to affiliated entities. In addition, our title insurance operations are also subject to applicable insurance and banking laws and regulations as well as government audits, examinations and investigations, all of which may limit our ability to provide title services to potential purchasers.\nThe regulatory environment for mortgage lending is complex and ever changing and has led to an increase in the number of audits, examinations and investigations in the industry. The 2008 housing downturn resulted in numerous changes in the regulatory framework of the financial services industry. More recently, in response to COVID-19, federal agencies, state governments and private lenders are proactively providing relief to borrowers in the housing market by, subject to requirements, suspending home foreclosures and granting payment forbearance, among other things. These relief measures are temporary, but these changes and others could become incorporated into the current regulatory framework. Any changes or new enactments could result in more stringent compliance standards, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results\nof operations and the market perception of our business. Additionally, if we are unable to originate mortgages for any reason going forward, our customers may experience significant mortgage loan funding issues, which could have a material impact on our homebuilding business and our consolidated financial statements.\nThe prices of our mortgages could be adversely affected if we lose any of our important commercial relationships.\nWe have longstanding relationships with members of the lender community from which our borrowers benefit. TMHF plans to continue with these relationships and use the correspondent lender platform as a part of its operational plan. If our relationship with any one or more of those banks deteriorates or if one or more of those banks decide to renegotiate or terminate existing agreements or otherwise exit the market, TMHF may be required to increase the price of our products, or modify the range of products TMHF offers, which could cause us to lose customers who may choose other providers based solely on price or fees, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to our indebtedness\nConstriction of the capital markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital.\nWe fund our operations with cash from operations, capital markets financings and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and other loan facilities. The expansion and development of our business may require significant capital, which we may be unable to obtain. Further, our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if, for example, our revenues do not reach, or our costs exceed, expected levels or we have to incur unforeseen capital expenditures to maintain our competitive position. If this is the case, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated or we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our development and expansion plans or otherwise forego market opportunities. Volatile economic conditions and the constriction of the capital markets could reduce the sources of liquidity available to us and increase our costs of capital. If the size or availability of our banking facilities is reduced in the future, or if we are unable to obtain new, or renew existing, facilities in the future on favorable terms or otherwise access the loan or capital markets, it would have an adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.\nOur substantial debt could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt-related obligations.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2020, the total principal amount of our debt (including $127.3 million of indebtedness of TMHF) was $2.9 billion. Our substantial debt could have important consequences for the holders of our Common Stock, including:\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt or to our trade or other creditors;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures and land acquisitions, particularly when the availability of financing in the capital markets is limited;\n\u2022requiring us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable rate indebtedness if interest rates rise;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations and the proceeds of any capital markets offerings or loan borrowings for the payment of interest on our debt thus reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, land acquisitions and general corporate requirements;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors.\nWe cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us through capital markets financings or under our Revolving Credit Facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before its maturity. We cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in order to finance our operations, to fund acquisitions, or to repay existing indebtedness. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional debt or equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. We cannot ensure that any such actions, if necessary, could be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements governing our Revolving Credit Facility and other indebtedness may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nThe agreement governing our Revolving Credit Facility limits our ability, and the terms of any future indebtedness may prohibit or limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022repurchase equity or subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock;\n\u2022sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022agree to restrictions on distributions, transfers or dividends affecting our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022enter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022incur liens; and\n\u2022designate any of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the indentures governing our Senior Notes contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur certain liens securing indebtedness without equally and ratably securing the Senior Notes and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications.\nThe agreement governing our new Revolving Credit Facility contains certain \u201cspringing\u201d financial covenants requiring Taylor Morrison Home III Corporation, a Delaware corporation and our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, and its subsidiaries to comply with a maximum capitalization ratio and a minimum consolidated tangible net worth test.\nThe restrictions contained in the indentures governing all of our Senior Notes and the agreement governing our Revolving Credit Facility could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or make acquisitions or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans.\nA breach of any of the restrictive covenants under the agreements governing our Revolving Credit Facility or any of our Senior Notes could allow for the acceleration of both the Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Notes. If the indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility or the Senior Notes were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness.\nRisks related to our organization and structure\nProvisions in our charter and by-laws and provisions of Delaware law may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party, which might diminish the value of our Common Stock. Provisions in our debt agreements may also require an acquirer to refinance our outstanding indebtedness if a change of control occurs.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws contain certain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable, including the following:\n\u2022the sole ability of the board of directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors;\n\u2022advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations;\n\u2022limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings and to take action by written consent;\n\u2022in certain cases, the approval of holders of at least three-fourths of the shares entitled to vote generally on the making, alteration, amendment or repeal of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws will be required to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws, or amend or repeal certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation;\n\u2022the required approval of holders of at least three-fourths of the shares entitled to vote at an election of the directors to remove directors, which removal may only be for cause; and\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used, among other things, to institute a rights plan that would have the effect of significantly diluting the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may affect the ability of an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to engage in certain business combinations for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d We have elected in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation not to be subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Nevertheless, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that have the same effect as Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your Common Stock in an acquisition.\nUnder our Revolving Credit Facility, a change of control would be an event of default, which would therefore require a third-party acquirer to obtain a facility to refinance any outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. Under the indentures governing our Senior Notes, if a change of control were to occur, we would be required to make offers to repurchase the Senior Notes at prices equal to 101% of their respective principal amounts. These change of control provisions in our existing debt agreements may also delay or diminish the value of an acquisition by a third party.\nAny of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 13862, "SIC": 1531, "TIC": "TMHC"}
