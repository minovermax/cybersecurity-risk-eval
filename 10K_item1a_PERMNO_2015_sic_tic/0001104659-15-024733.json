{"cik": "1528393", "company": "ZaZa Energy Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Our Business\nWe do not have sufficient cash to continue as a going concern through May 2015, and our independent registered public accounting firm expressed substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern in its audit opinion for our December 31, 2014 consolidated financial statements.\nOur consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued their report dated March 31, 2015, in connection with the audit of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 that included an explanatory paragraph describing the existence of conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to our liquidity. The fact that we have received this going concern qualification from our independent registered public accounting firm will likely make it more difficult for us to raise capital on favorable terms and could hinder, to some extent, our operations. Additionally, our actual prospectus for adequate liquidity in 2015 are uncertain, especially in light of the fact that beginning on March 23, 2015, any holder of the $13.9 million in aggregate principal amount of our Senior Secured Notes may elect to require us to repurchase that holder\u2019s Senior Secured Notes within 30 days of making such an election. Although we are discussing with the holders of the Senior Secured Notes a 30-day extension (until April 22, 2015) of the earliest date that the holder of any of the Senior Secured Notes can exercise this right of repurchase, there is no assurance that we will be successful in being given such an extension. Even without considering the repurchase of any of the Senior Secured Notes, we do not anticipate having sufficient cash and cash equivalents to continue as a going concern through May 2015 without additional cash funding. If we are not able to continue as a going concern, we may have to declare, or be forced into bankruptcy and our stockholders will likely lose part or all of their investment. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nThe holders of our Senior Secured Notes currently possess a contractual right to require us to purchase all or a portion of the Senior Secured Notes and we do not have sufficient capital to purchase the Senior Secured Notes if such right is exercised.\nBeginning on March 23, 2015, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes may be able to exercise the Senior Secured Notes Put Option and require us to purchase all or a portion of the 10% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 at a price equal to the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes to be purchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest on such notes. If any of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes were to exercise their rights under the Senior Secured Notes Put Option, we would have 30 days to purchase those Senior Secured Notes. If the holders of the Senior Secured Notes exercise the Senior Secured Notes Put Option, we will not be able to fund our commitments without access to additional liquidity and we will be in default under the Senior Secured Notes. If the default under the Senior Secured Notes is in excess of $10 million, we would also be in default under the indenture that governs the Convertible Senior Notes. Although we are discussing with the holders of the Senior Secured Notes a 30-day extension (until April 22, 2015) of the earliest date that the holder of any of the Senior Secured Notes can exercise the Senior Secured Notes Put Option, there is no assurance that we will be successful in being given such an extension. If a default occurs under the Senior Secured Notes or the Convertible Senior Notes, the holders of such debt could accelerate the indebtedness, demand immediate payment and use a variety of legal remedies to enforce their claims. If any of these defaults and the acceleration of any of our debt were to occur, it is unlikely that we would be able to continue as a going concern and we may have to declare, or be forced into bankruptcy.\nOur substantial indebtedness, or debt we may incur in the future, could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $13.9 million outstanding in aggregate principal under our Senior Secured Notes, $40 million outstanding in aggregate principal under our 9% Convertible Senior Notes due 2017, and $47.3 million outstanding in aggregate principal under our Subordinated Notes, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness has, or could have, important consequences to our business, because:\n\u00b7 a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;\n\u00b7 it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7 it may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u00b7 even if we are able to refinance or modify our existing indebtedness, any such transactions may result in significant changes to the Company\u2019s capital structure, the disposition of material assets and adjustments to its balance sheet, and these changes may adversely affect the holders of ZaZa common stock through dilution or loss in value; and\n\u00b7 we may be substantially more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage and make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.\nIn addition, the terms of our Senior Secured Notes and our Convertible Senior Notes restrict, and the terms of any future indebtedness, including any future credit facility, may restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and grant liens because of\ndebt or financial covenants we are, or may be, required to meet. Thus, we may not be able to obtain sufficient capital to grow our business or implement our business strategy and may lose opportunities to acquire interests in oil properties or related businesses because of our inability to fund such growth.\nOur ability to comply with restrictions and covenants, including those in our Senior Secured Notes, Convertible Senior Notes or in any future debt agreement, is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. Our Senior Secured Notes also contain restrictions on the operation of our business, such as limitations on the sale and acquisition of assets, limitations on entering into joint ventures, limitations on restricted payments, limitations on mergers and consolidations, limitations on loans and investments, and limitations on the lines of business in which we may engage, which may limit our activities. Our Convertible Senior Notes contain certain of the foregoing restrictions as well. We must obtain consent from the holders of a majority of the Senior Secured Notes for certain transactions involving oil and gas properties, with certain carveouts and requirements to apply a portion of net sales proceeds to pay down the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and with certain carveouts to enter into our joint ventures. Thus, we may not be able to manage our cash flow in a manner that maximizes our business opportunities. Our failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants could result in a default, which could permit the holders of our Senior Secured Notes and our Convertible Senior Notes to accelerate repayments and foreclose on the collateral securing the indebtedness.\nOur current financial condition has adversely affected our business operations and our business prospects.\nOur current financial condition and resulting uncertainty have been disruptive to our business. Management has devoted substantial time and attention to improving our financial condition, thereby reducing its focus on operating the business. We may also lose employees as a result of uncertainties related to our financial condition. Further, our current financial condition and resulting uncertainty may cause operating partners to terminate their relationships with us or to tighten credit. These developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and cash flows. Moreover, if we are unable to raise a sufficient amount of cash to pay for our portion of costs associated with drilling programs initiated by our operating partners, we would be subject to customary non-consent penalties on an individual well by well basis with respect to any wells in which we are unable to participate, which would result in the loss of a significant portion of any future revenue derived from those non-consent wells. Similarly, if the Company is unable to fund renewals of expiring leases, it could lose portions of its acreage.\nOur asset carrying values have been impaired based, in part, on oil and gas prices as of December 31, 2014 and they may be further impaired if oil and gas prices continue to decline from prices in effect as of that date.\nOil prices have declined from a price of approximately $105 per barrel in June 2014 to approximately $50 per barrel as of March 1, 2015. This substantial decline in oil and gas prices has impacted our estimated net cash flows from our oil and gas reserves, which estimates are used to determine impairments of our oil and gas properties. As a result of the decline in oil and gas prices, we have revised our estimated reserves downward and have significantly reduced our estimated future cash flows. Based in part on our 2014 year-end estimates of proved reserves, we recorded an impairment charge of $3.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. We may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in future reporting periods if market prices for oil or natural gas continue to decline or based on other factors, including our ability to fund capital expenditures required to maintain our oil and gas reserves.\nA substantial or extended decline in crude oil and/or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on us.\nPrices for crude oil and gas (including prices for NGLs and condensate) fluctuate widely. Moreover, oil and gas prices depend on factors that are outside of our control, including:\n\u00b7 the level of consumer demand;\n\u00b7 domestic and worldwide supplies of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u00b7 the price and quantity of imported and exported crude oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u00b7 weather conditions and changes in weather patterns;\n\u00b7 domestic and international drilling activity;\n\u00b7 the availability, proximity and capacity of appropriate transportation facilities, gathering, processing and compression facilities and refining facilities;\n\u00b7 worldwide economic and political conditions, including political instability or armed conflict in oil and gas producing regions;\n\u00b7 the price and availability of, and demand for, competing energy sources, including alternative energy sources;\n\u00b7 the nature and extent of governmental regulation, including environmental regulation, regulation of derivatives transactions and hedging activities, regulations that restrict the ability of banking entities to (x) engage in proprietary trading, or (y) invest in or sponsor certain types of \u2018covered fund\u2019 entities, tax laws and regulations and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of crude oil, natural gas and related commodities;\n\u00b7 the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including trading by commodity price speculators and others; and\n\u00b7 the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures.\nIf oil and gas prices continue to decline or remain at current levels, it will have a substantial negative impact on our business. Our cash flows and results of operations depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for crude oil and gas. Prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil and/or natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our liquidity, the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses, our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations.\nWe require significant capital expenditures to conduct our business and we may have difficulty in obtaining such capital.\nOur exploration, development, and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. We have sold assets and incurred indebtedness in order to provide capital to carry out our activities. For example, we sold the Moulton acreage during the second and third quarter of 2013. Currently, our major source of income is from our joint ventures\u2019 carried interest and production. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables that may or may not be within our control, including:\n\u00b7 the level of oil and gas that is produced from existing wells on our properties;\n\u00b7 the prices at which our oil and gas production is sold;\n\u00b7 the operators in our joint venture\u2019s ability to develop the proved and unproved reserves;\n\u00b7 our ability to acquire, locate and produce new economically recoverable reserves;\n\u00b7 global credit and securities markets; and\n\u00b7 the ability and willingness of lenders and investors to provide capital and the cost of that capital.\nWe will need to raise capital to purchase new oil and gas leases and to fully explore and analyze leases that we have already purchased. We intend to pursue various strategies to raise capital, including asset sales, debt or equity financing, and joint ventures. For example, in September 2014, we sold 6,000 net acres of undeveloped leases in our East Texas JV to an affiliate of Quantum Energy Partners for approximately $11 million in cash and the Company\u2019s right to receive Quantum\u2019s interest in certain future wells. If we are unable to sell assets or if financing and joint venture partnerships are not available on acceptable terms or at all, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels or to implement our strategy, including expanding our existing portfolio. There can be no assurance as to our ability to sell assets or as to the availability or terms of any joint ventures or other financing.\nFailure to obtain the capital to fully explore our properties could lead to possible write-downs in the carrying value of our properties, a material decline in our oil and gas reserves as well as our revenues and results of operations. The failure to obtain additional capital could also materially adversely affect our operations and prospects, including potentially resulting in the reversion of certain portions of our acreage to lessors under our oil and gas leases.\nSubstantially all of our current operations are conducted through joint ventures, so problems with our joint ventures or our joint venture partners could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe conduct substantially all of our operations through joint ventures with third parties, and as a result, the continuation of such joint ventures is vital to our continued success. We may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. In many instances we depend on these third parties for elements of these arrangements that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as agreed payments of substantial development costs pertaining to the joint venture and their share of other costs of the joint venture. The performance of these third party obligations or the ability of third parties to meet their obligations under these arrangements is outside our control. If these parties do not meet or satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, the performance and success of these arrangements, and their value to us, may be adversely affected. If our current or future joint venture partners are unable to meet their obligations, we may be forced to undertake the obligations ourselves and/or incur additional expenses in order to have some other party perform such obligations. In such cases we may also be required to enforce our rights, which may cause disputes among our joint venture partners and us. If any of these events occur, they may adversely impact us, our financial performance and results of operations, these joint ventures and/or our ability to enter into future joint ventures.\nSuch joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when exploring and developing properties directly, including, for example:\n\u00b7 our joint venture partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions, such as proceeding with subsequent phases of the development of our acreage subject to the joint venture;\n\u00b7 disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses, delay or terminate projects and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business;\n\u00b7 our joint venture partners might become insolvent or bankrupt, leaving us liable for their shares of joint venture liabilities;\n\u00b7 we may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by our joint venture partners;\n\u00b7 our joint venture partners may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives;\n\u00b7 certain joint venture arrangements may prevent either joint venture partner from controlling the venture, and an impasse could be reached which might have a negative influence on our investment in the joint venture; and\n\u00b7 our joint venture partners may decide to terminate their relationship with us in any joint venture or sell their interest in any of these joint ventures and we may be unable to replace such joint venture partner or raise the necessary financing to purchase such joint venture partner\u2019s interest.\nAdditionally, almost all of our properties are operated by our joint venture partners. We have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of our non-operated properties, including the timing of drilling and other activities, compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to such properties after exhaustion of our carried interests. Thus, we may experience a reduction in revenues or higher costs as a result of certain decisions made by our joint venture partners.\nOur business is focused on new or emerging formations, which may be subject to more uncertainties than areas that are more developed or have a longer history of established production.\nThe results of our drilling in new or emerging formations, such as the Eagle Ford and Eagle Ford East trends, are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are developed and have established production. Because new or emerging formations have limited or no production history, we are less able to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict future drilling results. Further, part of the strategy of our joint ventures in the Eagle Ford and Eagle Ford East trends involve the use of horizontal drilling and completion techniques that have been successful in other shale formations. Although we and our joint venture partners have experience with horizontal drilling in these areas, the oil and gas industry\u2019s drilling and production history is limited when compared to conventional techniques. The ultimate success of these drilling and completion techniques will be better evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are better established.\nIf the drilling results of our operations are less than anticipated or are impacted by capital constraints of us or our joint venture partners, lease expirations, and/or a decline of natural gas and oil prices, our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate and we could incur material impairments of undeveloped properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nDrilling for and producing oil and gas are high-risk activities with many uncertainties that we cannot control.\nOur success will depend on the results of the exploration, development and production activities on our properties, and the properties that we may acquire. Oil and gas exploration, development and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or gas production. Decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data, and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or inaccurate or subject to varying interpretations or uncertainty. Costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical. Furthermore, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel drilling, and such work stoppage may not be covered by our insurance, including:\n\u00b7 unexpected drilling conditions;\n\u00b7 pressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u00b7 equipment failures or accidents;\n\u00b7 title problems;\n\u00b7 shortages of or delays in obtaining drilling equipment, services and supplies and qualified personnel;\n\u00b7 compliance with, or changes in, laws and regulations; and\n\u00b7 the availability and timely issuance of required permits and licenses.\nAdditionally, because substantially all of our operations are conducted through joint venture partners, we exercise little to no control over decisions and actions that could abate such risks. Increases in the costs of the drilling operations on our properties due to any of the above factors or other factors, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur estimates of oil and gas reserves involve inherent uncertainty, which could materially affect the quantity and value of our reported reserves and our financial condition.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and cash flows attributable to such reserves, including factors beyond our engineers\u2019 control (or the third party preparing the reserve report). Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves, or of cash flows attributable to such reserves, is a function of the available data, assumptions regarding future oil and gas prices, expenditures for future development and exploration activities, engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. In addition, accurately estimating reserves in shale formations such as ours can be even more difficult than estimating reserves in more traditional hydrocarbon bearing formations given the complexities of the projected decline curves and economics of shale gas wells. Additionally, \u201cprobable\u201d and \u201cpossible\u201d reserve estimates are estimates of unproved reserves and may be misunderstood or seen as misleading to investors that are not experts in the oil or natural gas industry.\nAs such, investors should not place undue reliance on these estimates. Reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions, based upon production history, development and exploration activities and prices of oil and gas. In addition, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data. Because of our smaller volume of reserves compared to our competitors, revisions in reserve estimate and future cash flows have a greater chance of being material to us.\nThe present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves referred to in any reserve report will not necessarily be the actual current market value of our estimated oil and gas reserves at such time. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from its proved reserves using the un-weighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month for each month within a twelve month period.\nWe may be unable to acquire or develop additional reserves, which would reduce our revenues and access to capital.\nProducing oil and gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Decline rates are typically greatest early in the productive life of a well. Estimates of the decline rate of an oil or gas wells, and those in shale formations, in particular, are inherently imprecise, and are less precise with respect to new or emerging oil and gas formations with limited production histories than for more developed formations with established production histories. Production on our properties and the reserves that may be recovered from wells on our properties will change if production from existing wells on our properties declines in a different manner than we or our joint venture parties have estimated. Thus, our future oil and gas reserves and production and, therefore, our future cash flow and results of operations, are highly dependent upon the success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current properties and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to find or acquire additional reserves or future production at acceptable costs. If we are unable to replace our current or future production, our cash flows and the value of our reserves may decrease, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to purchase the Senior Secured Notes and the Convertible Senior Notes upon a fundamental change.\nHolders of the Senior Secured Notes and the Convertible Senior Notes will have the right to require us to purchase the notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at 101% and 100%, respectively, of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchases of tendered Senior Secured Notes or Convertible Senior Notes. In addition, our ability to purchase the Senior Secured Notes and Convertible Senior Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by the agreements governing our then current and future indebtedness. Our failure to purchase tendered Senior Secured Notes and Convertible Senior Notes at a time when the purchase is required by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes or Convertible Senior Notes would constitute a default under those notes. A default under those notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default or require a prepayment under, or result in the acceleration of the maturity or purchase of, our existing or future other indebtedness. The requirement that we offer to purchase the Senior Secured Notes and Convertible Senior Notes upon a fundamental change is limited to the transactions specified in the definition of a fundamental change, which definition may differ from the definition of a fundamental change or change of control in the agreements governing our existing or future other indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the Senior Secured Notes and the Convertible Senior Notes.\nWe are concentrated in one geographic area, which increases our exposure to many of the risks enumerated herein.\nCurrently, ZaZa\u2019s operations are highly concentrated in Texas. This concentration increases the potential impact that many of the risks stated herein may have upon our ability to perform. For example, we have greater exposure to regulatory actions impacting Texas, natural disasters in the geographic area, competition for equipment, services and materials available in the area and access to infrastructure and markets.\nDrilling is a high-risk activity that could result in substantial losses for us, including liabilities under environmental laws, for which we may not be insured.\nOil and gas exploration, drilling and production activities are subject to numerous operating risks, including the possibility of:\n\u00b7 blowouts, fires and explosions;\n\u00b7 personal injuries and death;\n\u00b7 uninsured or underinsured losses;\n\u00b7 unanticipated, abnormally pressured formations;\n\u00b7 uncontrollable flows of oil, gas or well fluids;\n\u00b7 mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapses; and\n\u00b7 environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater contamination.\nAny of these operating hazards could cause damage to properties, serious injuries, fatalities, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs, and other environmental damages, which could expose us to liabilities, including strict liability, either directly or proportionately through our joint ventures. Even in the ordinary course, our operations result in the use, generation, handling and disposal of regulated wastes, petroleum hydrocarbons and other potentially hazardous materials. There is a risk of our incurring environmental costs and liabilities, or a proportionate share of such liabilities in our joint venture operations, due to the environmental risks inherent in oil and gas drilling and production activities. The payment of any of these liabilities could reduce, or even eliminate, the funds available for exploration, development, and acquisition or could result in a loss of our properties.\nWe are not fully insured against all risks, including development and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance. In addition, our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to sudden and accidental pollution, but not for other types of pollution. Our insurance might be inadequate to cover our liabilities. Our energy package is written on reasonably standard terms and conditions that are generally available to the exploration and production industry. The insurance market in general and the energy insurance market in particular have been difficult markets over the past several years. Insurance costs could increase in the future as the insurance industry adjusts to difficult exposures and we may decrease coverage and retain more risk to mitigate future cost increases. If we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits, or if we incur a liability for a risk at a time when we do not have liability insurance, then our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nPotential legislative and regulatory actions affecting our industry could increase our costs, reduce revenues from natural gas and oil sales, reduce our liquidity or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business.\nThe activities of exploration and production companies operating in the U.S. are subject to extensive regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities, and these permits are subject to revocation, modification and renewal. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violations could subject us to fines, injunctions or both. These laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning, designing, drilling, installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities. The environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations have become increasingly more stringent and now cover a broader range of our operations. Increased scrutiny of our industry by federal, state and local environmental authorities, as well as more stringent regulations, have the potential to materially increase our costs of doing business or subject us or our joint venture partners to potentially significant fines and penalties for non-compliance. Changes to all such existing laws and regulations or new laws and regulations such as those described below could, if adopted, have an adverse effect on our business.\nTaxation of Independent Producers\nRecently, the President and certain members of Congress have proposed changes in the Internal Revenue Code to eliminate certain U.S. federal income tax deductions and credits currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. Such proposed changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas wells; (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; (iii) the elimination of the deduction against income derived from the production of oil and gas for certain domestic production activities; and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. These proposals would potentially increase and accelerate the payment of federal income taxes of independent producers of natural gas and oil.\nOTC Derivatives Regulation\nIn July 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), which contains measures aimed at migrating over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivative markets to exchange-traded markets and central clearinghouses. Certain companies that use derivatives to hedge commercial risk, referred to as end-users, are permitted to continue to use OTC derivatives under newly adopted regulations. We have not historically entered into hedging transactions. If we choose to do so, we will be required to comply with certain reporting, recordkeeping, clearing and trade execution requirements (or to take steps to qualify for exemptions, as applicable, to such requirements) that are set forth in the new legislation and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Such new regulatory requirements may increase our costs associated with hedging and decrease our profitability. Moreover, our counterparties may be required to comply with minimum capital requirements as well as reporting, recordkeeping and a number of other business conduct requirements, which could result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby negatively affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition. Other aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act still remain to be finalized, and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) has temporarily delayed the compliance dates for a number of the regulations already finalized. As a result, at this time it is not possible to predict with certainty the full effects of the Dodd-Frank Act and the related CFTC rules on us and the timing of such effects.\nClimate Change\nVarious governmental authorities and regional organizations have enacted, or are considering enacting new legislation and promulgating new regulations governing or restricting the emission of greenhouse gases from stationary sources such as our equipment and operations. At the federal level, the EPA has already made findings and issued regulations that require some oil and gas exploration and production companies to establish and report an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and they continue to propose more stringent or more broadly applicable requirements in this regard. Other legislative and regulatory proposals for restricting greenhouse gas emissions or otherwise addressing climate change could require us to incur additional operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the natural gas and oil sold from our properties. The potential increase in our operating costs could result from new or increased costs to obtain permits, operate and maintain equipment and facilities, install new emission controls on equipment and facilities, acquire allowances to authorize greenhouse gas emissions, pay taxes related to greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program. Even without federal legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, states may pursue the issue either directly or indirectly. Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and gas industry. Moreover, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources as a means of addressing climate change could reduce demand for natural gas and oil. In addition, scientific studies suggest that stronger storms may occur in areas where we operate in the future due to changing climate patterns. Adverse weather events have the potential to disrupt operations and cause physical damage to our assets and operations.\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to oil and gas extraction, including hydraulic fracturing, could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays and inability to book future reserves.\nHydraulic fracturing impacts and practices have been the subject of a number of governmental and private studies. The EPA is conducting an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices and expects to issue its draft report in the near future. In April 2012, the Department of Interior, the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency issued a memorandum outlining the multi-agency collaboration on unconventional oil and gas research in response to the White House Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future and the recommendation of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board Subcommittee on Natural Gas. The Department of Interior finalized new regulations governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands on March 20, 2015. These ongoing studies and the newly enacted federal and Indian lands rules could lead to initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing done on private lands. Additional requirements could be imposed, including permitting requirements, financial assurances, public disclosure obligations, more stringent well installation requirements, monitoring and reporting requirements. New requirements could increase operating costs and any disclosure requirements could increase the possibility of third-party or governmental legal challenges to hydraulic fracturing.\nThe EPA has also begun to assert regulatory authority over certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing. Recently, the EPA asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the SDWA\u2019s Underground Injection Control Program (\u201cUIC\u201d), and has proposed UIC permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel fuel in fracturing fluids. In addition, the EPA has issued new emission standards to reduce VOC emissions from oil and gas exploration and production operations including specific limitations for emissions associated with hydraulic fracturing. In particular, hydraulically fractured gas wells must comply with reduced emission completion (\u201cREC\u201d) techniques by January 1, 2015. Further, the agency has announced that one of its enforcement initiatives for its 2011 to 2013 fiscal years would be to focus on environmental compliance by the energy extraction sector. Finally, on October 20, 2011, the EPA announced its plan to propose pretreatment standards for wastewater generated during the hydraulic fracturing process and is also contemplating updated water quality criteria (planned for summer of 2014) for chlorides. These governmental studies of hydraulic fracturing impacts and practices and the EPA\u2019s regulatory and enforcement initiatives could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business. Congress has also considered bills which, if enacted, would repeal an exemption in the federal Safe Drinking Water Act for the underground injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids near drinking water sources and could result in additional regulatory\nburdens, such as permitting, construction, financial assurance, monitoring, recordkeeping and plugging and abandonment requirements.\nIf extraction procedures, including hydraulic fracturing, become increasingly regulated at the federal level as a result of additional federal legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA, our operations could become subject to additional permitting and operational requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. If such permitting requirements delays drilling activity on our properties, our ability to present reserves, and once presented, book reserves, will be delayed as well.\nIn addition, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations as well as possible restrictions on certain air pollutants, such as methane. For example, Pennsylvania, Colorado, and Wyoming have each adopted a variety of well construction, set back, and disclosure regulations limiting how fracturing can be performed and requiring various degrees of chemical disclosure. Colorado recently proposed new air quality standards for methane emissions from oil and gas exploration operations. Texas recently passed a law requiring public disclosure of certain information about chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process, and the Railroad Commission of Texas has adopted rules setting forth requirements for such public disclosure. In addition, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality recently adopted more stringent air emission and permitting requirements for oil and gas exploration operations in the Barnett Shale. More stringent air emissions and permitting requirements, as well as wastewater discharge limitations, may be imposed on the areas in which we operate sometime in the future. These regulations, if adopted, would affect our operations, increase our costs of exploration and production and limit the quantity of oil and gas that we or our joint ventures can economically produce. A major risk inherent in drilling plans for our properties is the need to obtain drilling permits from state and local authorities on a timely basis following leasing. In addition to the imposition of more stringent regulations at the state and federal level, certain local authorities have passed or are considering moratoria on oil and gas drilling and restrictions on hydraulic fracturing. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, drilling permits, the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well or the receipt of a permit with unreasonable conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to explore or develop its properties. Additionally, the oil and gas regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase our financial and managerial costs to comply with the requirements of these laws and regulations and, consequently, materially adversely affect our profitability. Furthermore, these additional costs may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to larger companies in the industry which can spread such additional costs over a greater number of wells and larger operating staff.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon gathering, transportation, and processing facilities over which we may have little or no control.\nThe marketing of oil and gas production depends in large part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines and storage facilities, gas gathering systems and other transportation, processing and refining facilities, as well as the existence of adequate markets. If there were insufficient capacity available on these systems, or if these systems were unavailable to us, the price offered for our production could be significantly depressed, or we could be forced to shut-in some production or delay or discontinue drilling plans and commercial production following a discovery of hydrocarbons while we construct our own facility. We also rely (and expect to rely in the future) on facilities developed and owned by third parties in order to store, process, transmit and sell our oil and gas production. Our plans to develop our oil and gas reserves could be materially and adversely affected by the inability or unwillingness of third parties to provide sufficient transmission, storage or processing facilities to us, especially in areas of planned expansion where such facilities do not currently exist.\nIf the amount of oil, gas or condensate being produced by us and others exceeds the capacity of the various transportation pipelines and gathering systems currently available in our operating areas, it will be necessary for new transportation pipelines and gathering systems to be built. Or, in the case of oil and condensate, it will be necessary for us to rely more heavily on trucks to transport our production, which is more expensive and less efficient than transportation by pipeline. The construction of new pipelines and gathering systems is capital intensive and construction may be postponed, interrupted or cancelled in response to changing economic conditions and the availability and cost of capital. In addition, capital constraints could limit our ability to build gathering systems to transport our production to transportation pipelines. In such event, costs to transport our production may increase materially or we might have to shut-in its wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity and/or sell our production at much lower prices than market or than we currently project, all of which would materially adversely affect our results of operation.\nAdditionally, we do not own all of the land on which gathering and treating systems for our production have been constructed, and we are therefore subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use.\nZaZa obtains the rights to construct and operate our gathering and treating systems on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. Our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are a relatively small company and therefore may not be able to compete effectively.\nCompared to many of our competitors in the oil and gas industry, we are a small company. We face difficulties in competing with larger companies. The costs of doing business in the exploration and production industry, including such costs as those required to explore new oil and gas plays, to acquire new acreage, and to develop attractive oil and gas projects, are significant. We face intense competition in all areas of our business from companies with greater and more productive assets, substantially larger staffs and greater financial and operating resources than we have. Our limited size has placed us at a disadvantage with respect to funding our operating costs, and means that we are more vulnerable to commodity price volatility and overall industry cycles, are less able to absorb the burden of changes in laws and regulations, and that poor results in any single exploration, development, or production play can have a disproportionately negative impact on us.\nWe also compete for people, including experienced geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other professionals. Our limited size has placed us at a disadvantage with respect to attracting and retaining management and other professionals with the technical abilities necessary to successfully operate our business. While we have entered into employment arrangements with certain of our senior executives, and while a number of consultants have consulting agreements with us, there can be no assurances that any of them will remain with us.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments is limited.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had gross U.S. federal tax net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of approximately $134 million. Use of these NOLs to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce U.S. federal income taxes otherwise payable is subject to substantial limitations resulting from changes in ownership of our stock and the expiration of NOL carryforwards 20 years from the year in which the losses giving rise to the NOLs were incurred. In light of these limitations, we do not expect to obtain material future benefits from the use of NOLs.\nOur property acquisition strategy could fail or present unanticipated problems for our business in the future.\nOur growth strategy includes acquiring oil and gas properties depending on the availability of capital. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or finance and complete any particular acquisition successfully. Furthermore, acquisitions involve a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention from our daily operations;\n\u00b7 an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements;\n\u00b7 uncertainties in the validity of our assumptions about reserves, future production, revenues, capital expenditures, and operating costs, including synergies;\n\u00b7 a decrease in our liquidity as a result of using a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity, if any, to finance acquisitions;\n\u00b7 a significant increase in interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions;\n\u00b7 the assumption of unknown liabilities, losses, or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which indemnity is inadequate; and\n\u00b7 the incurrence of other significant charges, such as impairment of oil and gas properties, asset devaluation, or restructuring charges.\nOur decision to acquire a property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses, and seismic and other information, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations.\nAlso, our reviews of acquired properties are inherently incomplete because it generally is not feasible to perform an in-depth review of the individual properties involved in each acquisition given time constraints imposed by sellers. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully access their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every lease or well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken.\nWe face risks associated with hurricanes and other natural disasters in connection with our operations near coastal areas in Texas.\nA portion of our oil and gas properties are located near coastal areas of the Texas Gulf Coast. As a result, in the event of damage due to hurricanes, tropical storms, flooding or similar natural disasters, we could be subject to production curtailments in the future resulting from hurricane damage to certain fields or, even in the event that producing fields are not damaged, production could be curtailed due to damage to facilities and equipment owned by oil and gas purchasers, or vendors and suppliers.\nAccess to water to conduct hydraulic fracturing may not be available if water sources become scarce.\nThe availability of sources of water is crucial to conduct hydraulic fracturing. Approximately 80,000-100,000 gallons of water are necessary for drilling and completing one well with hydraulic fracturing in Texas. In recent years Texas has experienced severe droughts that have limited the water supplies that are necessary to conduct hydraulic fracturing. We can make no assurances that sufficient water resources will be available in the short or long term to carry out our current activities.\nHedging activities may require us to make significant payments that are not offset by sales of production and may prevent us from benefiting from increases in oil prices.\nWe have not historically entered into hedging transactions. However, we may in the future enter into various hedging transactions for a portion of our production in an attempt to reduce our exposure to the volatility of oil prices. In a typical hedge transaction, we will have the right to receive from the counterparty to the hedge the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index, multiplied by the quantity hedged. If the floating price exceeds the fixed price, we will be required to pay the counterparty this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged. In such case, we will be required to pay the difference regardless of whether we have sufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge. Significant reductions in production at times when the floating price exceeds the fixed price could require us to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of production. Hedging also could prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil prices above the fixed amount specified in the hedge.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe public price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe price and volume of our common stock may be volatile and subject to fluctuations. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u00b7 general market and economic conditions and market trends, including in the energy and oil industries and the financial markets generally;\n\u00b7 the political, economic and social situation in the United States;\n\u00b7 actual or expected variations in operating results;\n\u00b7 variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 our failure to meet projections in production and revenue;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, or other business developments, such as oil or gas discoveries;\n\u00b7 adoption of new accounting standards affecting the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7 operations and stock performance of competitors;\n\u00b7 litigation or governmental action involving or affecting us or our subsidiaries;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7 purchase or sales of blocks of our common stock; and\n\u00b7 operating and stock performance of the companies that investors may consider to be comparable.\nThere can be no assurance that the price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly. The stock market in recent years has experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies and that could materially adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. The market prices of stock in exploration stage companies have been especially volatile. In addition, price volatility might be worse if the trading volume of shares of the common stock is low. Furthermore, stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our common stock declines significantly, which may cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management.\nWe may not be able to maintain compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements.\nOur common stock is listed on NASDAQ. There are a number of continued listing requirements that we must satisfy in order to maintain our listing on NASDAQ. If we fail to maintain compliance with all applicable continued listing requirements and NASDAQ determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock, our ability to obtain financing and our ability to fund our operations.\nOne continued listing requirement is for us to maintain a minimum market value of $35 million, which is calculated by multiplying the Company\u2019s total shares of common stock outstanding by the closing bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock. The historical market value of our common stock has fluctuated significantly, and on February 26, 2015, we received notice from the\nNASDAQ that the market value of our common stock was below $35 million for the 30 consecutive trading days preceding February 26, 2015. As a result of this notice, we have 180 calendar days, or until August 25, 2015, to regain compliance, which can be achieved if our minimum market value exceeds $35 million for at least ten consecutive trading days or a longer period determined by the NASDAQ staff in their sole discretion. Failure to meet the $35 million minimum market value for the time periods specified by NASDAQ listing requirements could result in our being delisted from the NASDAQ. A delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock; and limiting our ability to issue additional securities in the future.\nThe majority of our common stock is owned by the ZaZa Founders, whose interests may not be aligned with the interests of other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2014 approximately 54% of our common stock is owned directly or indirectly by the ZaZa Founders. Under a stockholders\u2019 agreement between the Company and the ZaZa LLC Members entered into in connection with the Combination (the \u201cStockholders\u2019 Agreement\u201d), the ZaZa Founders, during the period ending on February 21, 2015, were entitled to designate a proportional number of directors to the Board (but not more than seven) based upon the ZaZa Founders\u2019 (and their permitted transferees\u2019) percentage ownership of ZaZa. The remaining directors of ZaZa were nominated by a nominating committee consisting of two directors selected by the designees on the Board that were selected by Toreador prior to the closing of the Combination (and their successors) and one independent director selected by the ZaZa Founders. However, as of February 21, 2015, there is no limitation on the number of directors of ZaZa that the ZaZa Founders may nominate and elect and, as such, they may be able to nominate and elect the entire Board and remove any directors, including directors who were Toreador designees or nominated by the Board\u2019s nominating committee.\nIn addition, as a result of their share ownership in ZaZa, the ZaZa Founders are able to control all matters requiring approval by ZaZa stockholders, including, but not limited to: mergers, consolidations or acquisitions; the sale of all or substantially all of ZaZa\u2019s assets and other decisions affecting ZaZa\u2019s capital structure; the amendment of ZaZa\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and ZaZa\u2019s liquidation, winding up and dissolution.\nAdditionally, under the Stockholders\u2019 Agreement, the ZaZa Founders were subject to a standstill period that expired on February 21, 2015. Thus, as of February 21, 2015, there is no contractual restriction on the ZaZa Founders\u2019 ability to purchase additional shares of our common stock or take us private on terms that may not be favorable to the other stockholders of ZaZa. The interests of the ZaZa Founders may not be aligned with the interests of the other stockholders. This concentration of share ownership may have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with significant stockholders. However, with certain exceptions, the purchase by one or more ZaZa Founders that takes the total number of shares of common stock owned by the ZaZa Founders over 7,597,686 shares will cause a \u201cfundamental change\u201d under our Senior Secured Notes, giving those noteholders the rights to cause the Company to offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes for $1,010 per $1,000 principal amount.\nThe ZaZa Founders have economic interests in our properties and their interests may not be aligned with our interests.\nThe ZaZa Founders are board members and collectively, beneficially own approximately 54% of our common stock as of December 31, 2014. In addition to their interests as equity owners, each of these individuals also has a direct or indirect overriding royalty interest relating to certain of our properties. These overriding royalty interests generally entitle each of them to one percent of the net revenue interest associated with sales of oil and gas produced from these properties, without any corresponding responsibility for payment of any expenses.\nFuture sales of our common stock could put a downward pressure on the price of our shares and cause significant dilution.\nWe have several effective registration statements on file with the SEC that would allow for the sale or resale of substantial amounts of our common stock. For example, in December 2012, we filed a resale registration statement on Form S-1 for the sale of approximately 3.2 million shares of our common stock, including approximately 2.7 million shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of our Warrants at the time. A substantial majority of those shares remain unsold. Also, in October 2012, we issued $40 million in aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Senior Notes, which are convertible into 1.6 million shares of our common stock that may generally be sold by non-affiliates without restriction pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Finally, the ZaZa Founders have demand and piggyback registration rights pursuant to the Stockholders\u2019 Agreement with respect to their shares of common stock held. The possibility that substantial amounts of our outstanding common stock may be sold by such holders, or the perception that such sales could occur, could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities in the future. In addition, this selling activity could cause significant dilution, decrease the level of public interest in our common stock, inhibit buying activity that might otherwise help support the market price of our common stock, and prevent possible upward price movements in our common stock. Furthermore, the issuances of a substantial number of shares pursuant to future or existing employee compensation arrangements could produce additional dilution.\nAn active public market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nAlthough our shares of common stock are listed on the NASDAQ, an active public market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could affect the ability to sell, or depress the market price of, our common stock. We are unable to predict whether an active trading market for our common stock will be sustained.\nWe have the ability to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could affect the rights of holders of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation allows the Board of Directors to issue up to 25 million shares of preferred stock and to set the terms of such preferred stock. The terms of such preferred stock may materially adversely impact the dividend and liquidation rights of holders of our common stock.\nWe are an emerging growth company and reduced disclosure requirements associated with this status could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved and an exemption from obtaining an auditor\u2019s attestation on internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, even if we comply with the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth companies, we may avail ourselves of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future, so long as we are an emerging growth company. We may remain an emerging growth company and elect to take advantage of associated exemptions until the earlier of (a) the end of a fiscal year in which our annual revenues exceed $1 billion; (b) the date on which we have, during a three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; (c) the date on which we qualify as a large accelerated filer and (d) December 31, 2017. Investors and securities analysts may find it more difficult to evaluate our common stock because we may rely on one or more of these exemptions, and, as a result, investor confidence and the market price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to companies that are not emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have not elected to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make it difficult to compare our financial statements with those of other public companies.\nTwo of the ZaZa Founders are no longer subject to non-competition agreements; the third ZaZa Founder, the Company\u2019s CEO, will not be subject to a non-compete if his employment ends.\nOn August 9, 2011, each of the ZaZa Founders entered into a separate non-competition agreement with ZaZa. The non-competition agreements provide that each of the ZaZa Founders and his controlled affiliates may not engage in, carry on or assist any oil or gas business in specified areas in the Eagle Ford and Eagle Ford East trends in Texas and the Paris Basin in France or acquire oil and gas interests in, or acquire interests in any businesses with oil and gas interests in, those specified areas, subject to certain exceptions. The ZaZa Founders also agreed not to advise, request, induce, attempt to induce or otherwise divert any customer, supplier, licensee or other business relation of ZaZa and its present and future subsidiaries, and further agreed not to materially curtail, limit or cease doing business with any such entities or materially interfere with the customer, supplier and other business relationships of, or oil and gas interests or the businesses of, ZaZa, and its present and future subsidiaries. The non-competition agreements do not apply to any opportunity in which the ZaZa Founders would be prohibited from participating, if such opportunity is first offered to ZaZa and a majority of the full board of directors of ZaZa, including a majority of the disinterested directors, declines to pursue such opportunity, or a majority of the disinterested directors fails to make a determination as to whether ZaZa will pursue such opportunity within ten business days following such offer.\nThe non-competition agreement with each ZaZa Founder lasts only until the later of the termination of the ZaZa Founder\u2019s employment with ZaZa or February 21, 2015. As of February 21, 2015, Todd A. Brooks was the only ZaZa Founder who was still employed by ZaZa; therefore, the non-competition agreements with Gaston L. Kearby and John E. Hearn, both of whom continue to serve on our board of directors, have expired. Messrs. Hearn and Kearby, subject to their fiduciary duties as members of our board of directors, are therefore free to pursue competitive activities or corporate opportunities, which could create conflicts of interest and\nlimit ZaZa\u2019s ability to acquire additional assets or pursue its businesses and could have a material adverse effect on us. Mr. Brooks will be free to pursue competitive activities or corporate opportunities upon termination of his employment as our Chief Executive Officer, or if the ZaZa board of directors declines or fails to determine whether to pursue a corporate opportunity within ten business days of it being presented to the board of directors by Mr. Brooks.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules and qualify for, and may rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance standards.\nThe ZaZa Founders beneficially own approximately 54% of the outstanding voting power of our capital stock as of December 31, 2014. Accordingly, the ZaZa Founders will have the ability to elect our board of directors and thereby control the management and affairs of ZaZa. Therefore, we are deemed to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d for purposes of Nasdaq Rule 5615(c)(2). Under this rule, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect to be exempt from certain corporate governance requirements, including requirements that (1) a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors, and that (2) compensation of officers be determined or recommended to the board of directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a compensation committee comprised of independent directors.\nProvisions of Delaware law, our charter documents and the agreements governing the Convertible Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Notes may impede or discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a fundamental change or a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our board of directors has the power, without stockholder approval, to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock. The ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, certain provisions of the Convertible Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, subject to certain conditions, holders of Senior Secured Notes and Convertible Senior Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of their notes. We may also be required, under certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for the Convertible Senior Notes if a holder elects to convert its Convertible Senior Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change.", "PERMNO": 76532, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "ZAZA"}
