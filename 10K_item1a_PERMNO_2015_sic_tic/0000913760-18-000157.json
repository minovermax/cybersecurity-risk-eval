{"cik": "913760", "company": "INTL FCSTONE INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-12-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe face a variety of risks that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations, including the following:\nOur ability to achieve consistent profitability is subject to uncertainty due to the nature of our businesses and the markets in which we operate. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 we recorded net income of $55.5 million, compared to net income of $6.4 million in fiscal 2017 and $54.7 million in fiscal 2016.\nOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future because of the following factors:\n\u2022\nmarket conditions, such as price levels and volatility in the commodities, securities and foreign exchange markets in which we operate;\n\u2022\nchanges in the volume of our market-making and trading activities;\n\u2022\nchanges in the value of our financial instruments, currency and commodities positions and our ability to manage related risks;\n\u2022\nthe level and volatility of interest rates;\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of funding and capital;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage personnel, overhead and other expenses;\n\u2022\nchanges in execution and clearing fees;\n\u2022\nthe addition or loss of sales or trading professionals;\n\u2022\nreduction in fee revenues from client trading and wealth management services;\n\u2022\nchanges in legal and regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions.\nAlthough we continue our efforts to diversify the sources of our revenues, it is likely that our revenues and operating results will continue to fluctuate substantially in the future and such fluctuations could result in losses. These losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe manner in which we account for certain of our precious metals and energy commodities inventory may increase the volatility of our reported earnings. Our net income is subject to volatility due to the manner in which we report our precious metals and energy commodities inventory held by subsidiaries that are not broker-dealers. Our precious metals and energy inventory held in subsidiaries which are not broker-dealers is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We generally mitigate the price risk associated with our commodities inventory through the use of derivatives. We do not elect hedge\naccounting under U.S. GAAP for this price risk mitigation. In such situations, any unrealized gains in our precious metals and energy inventory in our non-broker-dealer subsidiaries are not recognized under U.S. GAAP, but unrealized gains and losses in related derivative positions are recognized under U.S. GAAP. As a result, our reported earnings from these business segments are subject to greater volatility than the earnings from our other business segments.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition. As of September 30, 2018, our total consolidated indebtedness was $355.2 million, and we may increase our indebtedness in the future as we continue to expand our business. Our indebtedness could have important consequences and significant effects on our business, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring that a portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nmaking it difficult for us to optimally manage the cash flow for our businesses;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends and make distributions, make acquisitions and dispositions, borrow additional funds and make capital expenditures and other investments.\nWe may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future, including secured indebtedness. If new indebtedness is added to our current indebtedness levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nCommitted credit facilities currently available to us might not be renewed. We currently have four committed credit facilities under which we may borrow up to $594.5 million, consisting of:\n\u2022\na $262.0 million facility available to the Company, for general working capital requirements, committed until March 18, 2019.\n\u2022\na $75.0 million facility available to INTL FCStone Financial, for short-term funding of margin to commodity exchanges, committed until April 4, 2019.\n\u2022\na $232.5 million committed facility available to our wholly owned subsidiary, FCStone Merchant Services, LLC, for financing traditional commodity financing arrangements and commodity repurchase agreements, committed until November 1, 2019.\n\u2022\na $25.0 million facility available to our wholly owned subsidiary, INTL FCStone Ltd, for short-term funding of margin to commodity exchanges, committed until January 31, 2019.\nOf our committed credit facilities, $362 million are scheduled to expire during the 12-month period beginning with the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in renewing, extending or rearranging these facilities.\nThe Company\u2019s business requires substantial cash to support its operating activities. Our business involves the establishment and carrying of substantial open positions for clients on futures exchanges and in the OTC derivatives markets. We are required to post and maintain margin or credit support for these positions. Although we collect margin or other deposits from our clients for these positions, significant adverse price movements can occur which will require us to post margin or other deposits on short notice, whether or not we are able to collect additional margin or credit support from our clients. We have systems in place to collect margin and other deposits from clients on a same-day basis; however, there can be no assurance that these facilities and systems will be adequate to eliminate the risk of margin calls in the event of severe adverse price movements affecting open positions of our clients. As such, the Company may be dependent on its lines of credit and other financing facilities in order to fund margin calls and other operating activities.\nIt is possible that these facilities might not be renewed at the end of their commitment periods and that we will be unable to replace them with other facilities on terms favorable to us or at all. If our credit facilities are unavailable or insufficient to support future levels of business activities, we may need to raise additional funds externally, either in the form of debt or equity. If we cannot raise additional funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to develop or enhance our business, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressure or unanticipated requirements, leading to reduced profitability.\nOur failure to successfully integrate the operations of businesses acquired could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. From time to time, we may seek to expand our product offerings and /or geographic presence through acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies or services. Our ability to engage in suitable acquisitions will depend on our ability to identify opportunities for potential acquisitions that fit within our business model, enter into the agreements necessary to take advantage of these potential opportunities and obtain any necessary financing. We may not be able to do so successfully. We are regularly evaluating potential acquisition opportunities.\nWe will need to meet challenges to realize the expected benefits and synergies of these acquisitions, including:\n\u2022\nintegrating the management teams, strategies, cultures, technologies and operations of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\nretaining and assimilating the key personnel of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nretaining existing clients of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\ncreating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems; and\n\u2022\nachieving revenue growth because of risks involving (1) the ability to retain clients, (2) the ability to sell the services and products of the acquired companies to the existing clients of our other business segments, and (3) the ability to sell the services and products of our other business segments to the existing clients of the acquired companies.\nThe accomplishment of these objectives will involve considerable risk, including:\n\u2022\nthe potential disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing business and distraction of their respective management teams;\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenses related to technology integration; and\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities associated with the acquisitions.\nIt is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of the technical skills and management expertise of key employees, the disruption of the ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies due to possible cultural conflicts or differences of opinions on technical decisions and product road maps that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, counterparties, and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nWe face risks associated with our market-making and trading activities. We conduct our market-making and trading activities predominantly as a principal, which subjects our capital to significant risks. These activities involve the purchase, sale or short sale for clients and for our own account of financial instruments, including equity and debt securities, commodities and foreign exchange. These activities are subject to a number of risks, including risks of price fluctuations, rapid changes in the liquidity of markets and counterparty creditworthiness.\nThese risks may limit our ability to either resell financial instruments we purchased or to repurchase securities we sold in these transactions. In addition, we may experience difficulty borrowing financial instruments to make delivery to purchasers to whom we sold short, or lenders from whom we have borrowed. From time to time, we have large position concentrations in securities of a single issuer or issuers in specific countries and markets. This concentration could result in higher trading losses than would occur if our positions and activities were less concentrated.\nThe success of our market-making activities depends on:\n\u2022\nthe price volatility of specific financial instruments, currencies and commodities,\n\u2022\nour ability to attract order flow;\n\u2022\nthe skill of our personnel;\n\u2022\nthe availability of capital; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions.\nTo attract market-trading, market-making and trading business, we must be competitive in:\n\u2022\nproviding enhanced liquidity to our clients;\n\u2022\nthe efficiency of our order execution;\n\u2022\nthe sophistication of our trading technology; and\n\u2022\nthe quality of our client service.\nIn our role as a market maker and trader, we attempt to derive a profit from the difference between the prices at which we buy and sell financial instruments, currencies and commodities. However, competitive forces often require us to:\n\u2022\nmatch the quotes other market makers display; and\n\u2022\nhold varying amounts of financial instruments, currencies and commodities in inventory.\nBy having to maintain inventory positions, we are subject to a high degree of risk. We cannot ensure that we will be able to manage our inventory risk successfully or that we will not experience significant losses, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could negatively impact our earnings. A significant portion of our international business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar can therefore affect the value of our non-U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Although we closely monitor potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies and adopt strategies designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on our financial performance, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in managing our foreign exchange risk. Our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the U.S. increases. Any material fluctuations in currencies could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to certain risks as a result of operating in countries with high levels of inflation. We are exposed to risks as a result of operating in countries with high levels of inflation. These risks include the risk that the rate of price increases will not keep pace with the cost of inflation, adverse economic conditions may discourage business growth which could affect demand for our services, the devaluation of the currency may exceed the rate of inflation and reported U.S. dollar revenues and profits may decline, and these countries may be deemed \u201chighly inflationary\u201d for U.S. GAAP purposes.\nFor example, we have wholly owned subsidiaries in Argentina which employed 76 people as of September 30, 2018, and primarily conduct debt trading and asset management business activities for clients. The Argentinian economy was recently determined to be highly inflationary. For U.S. GAAP purposes, a highly inflationary economy is one where the cumulative inflation rate for the three years preceding the beginning of the reporting period, including interim reporting periods, is in excess of 100 percent. Argentina\u2019s inflation rate reached this threshold during the quarterly period ended June 30, 2018. For periods through June 30, 2018, the functional currency for certain of our subsidiaries was the Argentinian peso, the local currency of these subsidiaries. In accordance with this designation, effective July 1, 2018 we report the financial results of the subsidiaries in Argentina at the functional currency of their parent, which is the U.S. dollar. Going forward, fluctuations in the Argentinian peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate could negatively impact our earnings.\nWe operate as a principal in the OTC derivatives markets which involves the risks associated with commodity derivative instruments. We offer OTC derivatives to our clients in which we act as a principal counterparty. We endeavor to simultaneously offset the underlying risk of the instruments, such as commodity price risk, by establishing corresponding offsetting positions with commodity counterparties, or alternatively we may offset those transactions with similar but not identical positions on an exchange. To the extent that we are unable to simultaneously offset an open position or the offsetting transaction is not effective to fully eliminate the derivative risk, we have market risk exposure on these unmatched transactions. Our exposure varies based on the size of the overall positions, the terms and liquidity of the instruments brokered, and the amount of time the positions remain open.\nTo the extent an unhedged position is not disposed of intra-day, adverse movements in the reference assets or rates underlying these positions or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these positions could result in a substantial loss. In addition, any principal gains and losses resulting from these positions could on occasion have a disproportionate effect, positive or negative, on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period.\nTransactions involving OTC derivative contracts may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the level, volatility, correlation or relationship between market prices, rates, indices and/or other factors. These types of instruments may also suffer from illiquidity in the market or in a related market.\nOTC derivative transactions are subject to unique risks. OTC derivative transactions are subject to the risk that, as a result of mismatches or delays in the timing of cash flows due from or to counterparties in OTC derivative transactions or related hedging, trading, collateral or other transactions, we or our counterparty may not have adequate cash available to fund our or its current obligations.\nWe could incur material losses pursuant to OTC derivative transactions because of inadequacies in or failures of our internal systems and controls for monitoring and quantifying the risk and contractual obligations associated with OTC derivative transactions and related transactions or for detecting human error, systems failure or management failure.\nOTC derivative transactions may generally only be modified or terminated only by mutual consent of the parties to any such transaction (other than in certain limited default and other specified situations (e.g., market disruption events)) and subject to agreement on individually negotiated terms. Accordingly, it may not be possible to modify, terminate or offset obligations or exposure to the risk associated with a transaction prior to its scheduled termination date.\nIn addition, we note that as a result of rules recently adopted by U.S. regulators concerning certain financial contracts (including OTC derivatives) entered into with our counterparties that have been designated as global systemically important banking organizations, we may be restricted in our ability to terminate such contracts following the occurrence of certain insolvency-related default events. The rules are being progressively implemented between January 1, 2019 and January 1, 2020.\nChanges to the U.S. corporate tax system have had and may in the future continue to have a significant effect on the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets and will result in additional U.S. corporate tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from deemed repatriation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The recent reform of the U.S. tax system includes changes to corporate tax rates, a one-time mandatory repatriation transition tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of certain of our foreign subsidiaries and also establishes new tax laws that will affect the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 and subsequent fiscal years, including, but not limited to, (1) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax, (2) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income, (3) limitations on the utilization of net operating losses incurred in tax years beginning after September 30, 2018 to 80% of taxable income per tax\nyear, (4) the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax, (5) a general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, and (6) limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and certain executive compensation.\nAs of September 30, 2018, the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in $8.6 million of tax expense. The accounting for this amount is considered complete.\nThe transition tax requires us to determine, in addition to other factors, the amount of post 1986 earnings and profits of the relevant subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-US income taxes paid on such earnings. We made a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and recorded a provisional transition tax obligation as of September 30, 2018 of $11.2 million. While we can make reasonable estimates for the deemed repatriation transition tax, the final tax impact may differ from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in our interpretations and assumptions, additional guidance that may be issued by taxing authorities, and actions we may take.\nMost state and local income tax jurisdictions have updated their conformity or issued guidance on their level of conformity with the U.S. federal income tax changes as of September 30, 2018. We are able to calculate the impact of the reduction in corporate rate and the deemed repatriation transition tax for state and local income tax purposes and the impact on tax expense is immaterial.\nWe may have difficulty managing our growth. We have experienced significant growth in our business. Our operating revenues grew from $490.9 million in fiscal 2014 to $975.8 million in fiscal 2018. This growth may continue, including as a result of any acquisitions we have recently undertaken or may undertake in the future.\nThis growth required, and will continue to require, us to increase our investment in management personnel, financial and management systems and controls, and facilities. In the absence of continued revenue growth, or if growth is at a rate lower than our expectations, the costs associated with our expected growth would cause our operating margins to decline from current levels. In addition, as is common in the financial industry, we are and will continue to be highly dependent on the effective and reliable operation of our communications and information systems.\nThe scope of procedures for assuring compliance with applicable rules and regulations changes as the size and complexity of our business increases. In response, we have implemented and continue to revise formal compliance procedures; however, there can be no assurances that such procedures will be effective.\nIt is possible that we will not be able to manage our growth successfully. Our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nLapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our operations, profitability or reputation. As an SEC reporting company, we are required to maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Nevertheless, lapses or deficiencies in disclosure controls and procedures or in our internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time.\nThere can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in the future or that a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting will not exist. Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition, require us to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose us to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject us to fines, penalties, judgments or losses not covered by insurance, harm our reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could harm our business. We have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future. However, our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated. Our risk management policies and procedures require, among other things, that we properly record and verify many thousands of transactions and events each day, and that we continuously monitor and evaluate the size and nature of our or our clients\u2019 and counterparties\u2019 positions and the associated risks. In light of the high volume of transactions, it is impossible for us to review and assess every single transaction or to monitor at every moment in time our or our clients\u2019 and counterparties\u2019 positions and the associated risks.\nOur policies and procedures used to identify, monitor and mitigate a variety of risks, including risks related to human error, client defaults, market movements, fraud and money-laundering, are established and reviewed by the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. Some of our methods for managing risk are discretionary by nature and are based on internally developed controls and observed historical market behavior, and also involve reliance on standard industry practices. These methods may not adequately prevent losses, particularly as they relate to extreme market movements, which may be significantly greater than historical fluctuations in the market. Our risk management policies and procedures also may not adequately prevent losses due to technical errors if our testing and quality control practices are not effective in preventing software or hardware failures. In addition, we may elect to adjust our risk management policies and procedures to allow for an increase in risk tolerance, which\ncould expose us to the risk of greater losses. Our risk management policies and procedures rely on a combination of technical and human controls and supervision that are subject to error and failure. These policies and procedures may not protect us against all risks or may protect us less than anticipated, in which case our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our clients and counterparties and their failure to meet their financial obligations could adversely affect our business. We have substantial credit risk in both our securities and commodities businesses. As a market maker of OTC and listed securities and a dealer in fixed income securities, we conduct the majority of our securities transactions as principal with institutional counterparties. We clear the majority of our principal securities transactions through unaffiliated clearing brokers or banks, who also are the custodian of the majority of our principal equity and debt securities. In these transactions, we may suffer losses as a result of a counterparty\u2019s failure to fulfill its contractual obligations. We borrow securities from, and lend securities to, other broker-dealers, and may also enter into agreements to repurchase and agreements to resell securities. Adverse changes in market conditions related to securities utilized in these transactions may result in losses if counterparties to these transactions fail to honor their commitments.\nIn our correspondent securities clearing and independent wealth management businesses, we permit clients to purchase securities on margin, subject to various regulatory and internal margin requirements. During periods of significant price declines, the value of collateral securing the client\u2019s margin loan may decline below the client\u2019s obligation to us. In the event, the client is unable to deposit additional collateral for these margin loans, we may incur credit losses on these transactions or additional costs in attempting to secure additional collateral. While introducing broker-dealers and independent representatives are generally responsible for the credit losses of their clients, we may incur losses if they do not fulfill their obligations.\nAs a clearing broker in futures and option transactions, we act on behalf of our clients for all trades consummated on exchanges. We must pay initial and variation margin to the exchanges before we receive the required payments from our clients. Accordingly, we are responsible for our clients\u2019 obligations with respect to these transactions, including margin payments, which exposes us to significant credit risk. Client positions which represent a significant percentage of open positions in a given market or concentrations in illiquid markets may expose us to the risk that we are not able to liquidate a client\u2019s position in a manner which does not result in a deficit in that clients account. A substantial part of our working capital is at risk if clients default on their obligations to us and their account balances and security deposits are insufficient to meet all of their obligations.\nWe act as a principal for OTC derivative transactions (including commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate transaction), which exposes us to both the credit risk of our clients and the counterparties with which we offset the client\u2019s position. As with exchange-traded transactions, our OTC transactions require that we meet initial and variation margin payments on behalf of our clients before we receive the required payment from our clients. In addition, with OTC transactions, there is a risk that a counterparty will fail to meet its obligations when due. We would then be exposed to the risk that a settlement of a transaction which is due a client will not be collected from the respective counterparty with which the transaction was offset. Clients and counterparties that owe us money, securities or other assets may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons.\nWe act as a principal in our physical commodities trading activities which exposes us to the credit risk of our counterparties and clients in these activities.\nAlthough we have procedures for reviewing credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties to address present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee, including rapid changes in securities, commodity and foreign exchange price levels. Some of our risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us. That information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect us. We may be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default by our clients and counterparties.\nIn our securities, commodities and derivatives trading businesses we rely on the ability of our clearing brokers and banks to adequately discharge their obligations on a timely basis. We also depend on the solvency of our clearing brokers and custodians. Any failure by a clearing broker or bank to adequately discharge its obligations on a timely basis, or insolvency of a clearing broker or custodian, or any event adversely affecting our clearing brokers or custodians, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs a clearing member firm of clearing houses in the U.S. and abroad, we are also exposed to clearing member credit risk. Clearing houses require member firms to deposit cash and/or government securities to a clearing fund. If a clearing member defaults in its obligations to the clearing house in an amount larger than its own margin and clearing fund deposits, the shortfall is absorbed pro rata from the deposits of the other clearing members of the applicable clearing house. Several clearing houses\nof which we are members also have the authority to assess their members for additional funds if the clearing fund is depleted. A large clearing member default could result in a substantial cost to us if we are required to pay such assessments.\nOur net operating revenues may decrease due to changes in market volume, prices or liquidity. Declines in the volume of securities, commodities and derivative transactions and in market liquidity generally may result in lower revenues from market-making and trading activities. Changes in price levels of securities and commodities and other assets, and interest and foreign exchange rates also may result in reduced trading activity and reduce our revenues from market-making transactions. Changed price levels also can result in losses from changes in the fair value of securities, commodities and other assets held in inventory. Sudden sharp changes in fair values of securities, commodities and other assets can result in:\n\u2022\nilliquid markets;\n\u2022\nfair value losses arising from positions held by us;\n\u2022\nthe failure of buyers and sellers of securities, commodities and other assets to fulfill their settlement obligations;\n\u2022\nredemptions from funds managed in our asset management business segment and consequent reductions in management fees;\n\u2022\nreductions in accrued performance fees in our asset management business segment; and\n\u2022\nincreases in claims and litigation.\nAny change in market volume, price or liquidity or any other of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur net operating revenues may decrease due to changes in client trading volumes which are dependent in large part on commodity prices and commodity price volatility. Client trading volumes are largely driven by the degree of volatility-the magnitude and frequency of fluctuations-in prices of commodities. Higher volatility increases the need to hedge contractual price risk and creates opportunities for arbitrage trading. Energy and agricultural commodities markets periodically experience significant price volatility. In addition to price volatility, increases in commodity prices generally lead to increased trading volume. As prices of commodities rise, especially energy prices, new participants enter the markets to address their growing risk-management needs or to take advantage of greater trading opportunities. Sustained periods of stability in the prices of commodities or generally lower prices could result in lower trading volumes and, potentially, lower revenues. Lower volatility and lower volumes could lead to lower client balances held on deposit, which in turn may reduce the amount of interest revenue and account fees based on these deposits.\nFactors that are particularly likely to affect price volatility and price levels of commodities include:\n\u2022\nsupply and demand of commodities;\n\u2022\nweather conditions affecting certain commodities;\n\u2022\nnational and international economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\nperceived stability of commodities and financial markets;\n\u2022\nthe level and volatility of interest rates and inflation; and\n\u2022\nfinancial strength of market participants.\nAny one or more of these factors may reduce price volatility or price levels in the markets for commodities trading, which in turn could reduce trading activity in those markets. Moreover, any reduction in trading activity could reduce liquidity which in turn could further discourage existing and potential market participants and thus accelerate any decline in the level of trading activity in these markets.\nOur net operating revenues may be impacted by diminished market activity due to adverse economic, political and market conditions. The amount of our revenues depends in part on the level of activity in the securities, foreign exchange and commodities markets in which we conduct business. The level of activity in these markets is directly affected by numerous national and international factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\neconomic, political and market conditions;\n\u2022\nthe availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital;\n\u2022\nthe level and volatility of interest rates;\n\u2022\nlegislative and regulatory changes; and\n\u2022\ncurrency values and inflation.\nAny one or more of these factors may reduce the level of activity in any of these markets in which we conduct business, which could result in lower revenues from our market-making and trading activities. Any reduction in revenues or any loss resulting from these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe depend on our management team. Our future success depends, in large part, upon our management team who possess extensive knowledge and management skills with respect to securities, commodities and foreign exchange businesses we operate. The unexpected loss of services of any of our executive officers could adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively or execute our business strategy. Although some of these officers have employment contracts with us, they are generally not required to remain with us for a specified period of time.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for key personnel and other highly qualified management, sales, trading, compliance and technical personnel is significant. It is possible that we will be unable to retain our key personnel and to attract, assimilate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel or the inability to identify, hire, train and retain other qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFrom time to time, other companies in the financial sector have experienced losses of sales and trading professionals. The level of competition to attract these professionals is intense. It is possible that we will lose professionals due to increased competition or other factors in the future. The loss of a sales and trading professional, particularly a senior professional with broad industry expertise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event of employee misconduct or error, our business may be harmed. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years. Employee misconduct or error could subject us to legal liability, financial losses and regulatory sanctions and could seriously harm our reputation and negatively affect our business. Misconduct by employees could include engaging in improper or unauthorized transactions or activities, failing to properly supervise other employees or improperly using confidential information. Employee errors, including mistakes in executing, recording or processing transactions for clients, could cause us to enter into transactions that clients may disavow and refuse to settle, which could expose us to the risk of material losses even if the errors are detected and the transactions are unwound or reversed. If our clients are not able to settle their transactions on a timely basis due to employee error, our risk of material loss could be increased. The risk of employee error or miscommunication may be greater for products that are new or have non-standardized terms. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct or error, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases.\nInternal or third party computer and communications systems failures, capacity constraints and breaches of security could increase our operating costs and/or credit losses, decrease net operating revenues and cause us to lose clients. We are heavily dependent on the capacity and reliability of the computer and communications systems supporting our operations, whether owned and operated internally or by third parties, including those used for execution and clearance of our client\u2019s trades and our market-making activities. We receive and process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means, such as through public and private communications networks. These computer and communications systems and networks are subject to performance degradation or failure from any number of reasons, including loss of power, acts of war or terrorism, human error, natural disasters, fire, sabotage, hardware or software malfunctions or defects, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism, client error or misuse, lack of proper maintenance or monitoring and similar events. Our systems, or those of our third party providers, may fail or operate slowly, causing one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nunanticipated disruptions in service to our clients;\n\u2022\nslower response times;\n\u2022\ndelays in our clients\u2019 trade execution;\n\u2022\nfailed settlement of trades;\n\u2022\ndecreased client satisfaction with our services;\n\u2022\nincomplete, untimely or inaccurate accounting, recording, reporting or processing of trades;\n\u2022\nfinancial losses;\n\u2022\nlitigation or other client claims; and\n\u2022\nregulatory sanctions.\nIn addition, in connection with our business, we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our clients. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of the serious threats to information security. Our clients expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. Protecting against security breaches, including cyber-security attacks, is an increasing challenge, and penetrated or compromised data systems or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss or fraudulent or unlawful use of client or company data. It is possible that our security controls over personally identifiable information, our training of employees on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information that we store and manage.\nThe occurrence of degradation or failure of the communications and computer systems on which we rely, or the significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of client information, may lead to financial losses, litigation or arbitration claims filed by or on behalf of our clients and regulatory investigations and sanctions, including by the CFTC, which require that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volumes. Any such degradation or failure, or theft, loss or fraudulent use of client information, could also have a negative effect on our reputation, which in turn could cause us to lose existing clients to our competitors or make it more difficult for us to attract new clients in the future. Further, any financial loss that we suffer as a result of such degradations or failures in the performance of our computer and communications systems and networks could be magnified by price movements of contracts involved in transactions impacted by the degradation or failure, and we may be unable to take corrective action to mitigate any losses we suffer.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation. The securities and derivatives industries are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state and foreign laws. In addition, the SEC, the CFTC, FINRA, the MSRB, the FCA, the NFA, the CME Group, Inc. and other self-regulatory organizations (commonly referred to as SROs), state securities commissions, and foreign securities regulators require compliance with their respective rules and regulations. These regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the financial markets and protecting the interests of participants in those markets.\nAs participants in various financial markets and exchanges, we may be subject to regulation concerning certain aspects of our business, including without limitation:\n\u2022\nrisk management;\n\u2022\ntrade practices;\n\u2022\nthe way we communicate with, market our products and services to, and disclose risks to, clients;\n\u2022\nfinancial, transaction and other reporting requirements and practices;\n\u2022\nclient identification and anti-money laundering requirements;\n\u2022\ncapital structure;\n\u2022\nrecord creation and retention;\n\u2022\nsafeguarding and management of client assets and personal information;\n\u2022\nconflicts of interest; and\n\u2022\nthe conduct of our directors, officers and employees.\nFailure to comply with any of these laws, rules or regulations could result in adverse consequences. We and certain of our officers and employees have been subject to claims arising from acts that regulators asserted were in contravention of these laws, rules and regulations. These claims resulted in the payment of fines and/or other settlement terms (including requiring us to rectify any deficiencies identified by the applicable regulator - for example, amending our policies and procedures). It is possible that we, our officers and other employees will be subject to similar claims in the future. An adverse ruling against us or our officers and other employees could result in our or our officers and other employees being required to pay a substantial fine and/or other settlement terms and could result in a suspension or revocation of required registrations or memberships. Such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to change. Any rule changes, additional legislation or regulations (including changes required under the Dodd-Frank Act) and any new or revised regulation by the SEC, the CFTC, other U.S. or foreign governmental regulatory authorities, SROs, MSRB, NFA or FINRA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities, SROs, MSRB, NFA and FINRA could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Failure to comply with current or future legislation or regulations that apply to our operations could subject us to fines, penalties or material restrictions on our business in the future.\nAdditional regulation, changes in existing laws and rules, or changes in interpretations or enforcement of existing laws and rules often directly affect financial services firms. We cannot predict what effect any such changes might have on our business. Our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially affected by both regulations that are directly applicable to us and/or our counterparties and regulations of general application. Our level of trading and market-making activities can be affected not only by such legislation or regulations of general applicability, but also by industry-specific legislation or regulations.\nWe have incurred significant additional operational and compliance costs to meet regulatory requirements. These requirements have significantly affect our business and will continue to do so in the future. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive change to financial regulation in the U.S., and affects virtually every area of the capital markets, including, among other things, centralized clearing of standardized derivatives (with certain stated exceptions), the trading of clearable derivatives on swap execution facilities or exchanges, and registration and comprehensive regulation of market participants such as \u201cswap dealers\u201d. Implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act has required, and will continue to require, many lengthy rulemaking processes resulting in the adoption of a multitude of new regulations applicable to entities which transact business in the U.S. or with U.S. persons outside the U.S. The Dodd-Frank Act affects many aspects, in the U.S. and internationally, of our business, including OTC derivatives and other financial activities, and will have an effect on our revenue and profitability, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, impact the value of assets that we hold, require us to change certain business practices, impose additional costs on us and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act granted regulatory authorities, such as the CFTC and the SEC, broad rule-making authority to implement various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including comprehensive regulation of the OTC derivatives market. A substantial majority of the OTC derivatives transactions in which our subsidiaries and affiliates engage are subject to regulation by the CFTC, which has finalized and implemented most of the rules required under the Dodd-Frank Act. However, because the regulatory program for OTC derivatives is comparatively new, it is difficult to predict the extent to which we and our subsidiaries and affiliates will be affected by these implementing regulations as they come into effect. Accordingly, we cannot\nprovide assurance that new legislation and regulation will not eventually have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs to comply with these regulatory requirements. We have also incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs related to the development, operation and continued enhancement of our technology relating to many facets of our business, including trade execution, trade reporting, surveillance, record keeping and data reporting obligations, compliance and back-up and disaster recovery plans designed to meet the requirements of the regulators.\nChanges that have been, and that will continue to be made to, our OTC and clearing businesses in order to comply with our regulatory obligations have impacted the way be conduct these businesses and may adversely impact our current and future results of operations. As a result of the increased financial regulation (including as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act), the markets for cleared and non-cleared swaps may become less robust, there may be less volume and liquidity in these markets and there may be less demand for our services. This may occur as a result of, for example, certain banks and other large institutions being limited in their conduct of proprietary trading and being limited or prohibited from trading in certain derivatives. These rules, including the restrictions and limitations on the trading activities of certain banks and large institutions, may impact transaction volumes and liquidity in the markets in which we operate and our revenues would be adversely impacted as a result.\nThese changes to our OTC derivatives and clearing businesses may also adversely impact our cash flows and financial condition. Registration requirements have and will continue to impose substantial regulatory requirements upon certain of our entities including, among other things, capital and margin requirements, business conduct standards, initial and variation margin requirements, and record keeping and data reporting obligations. Increased regulatory oversight has also imposed administrative burdens on us related to, among other things, responding to regulatory examinations or investigations. Effective September 2016, CFTC margin rules came into effect, imposing new requirements on registered swap dealers (such as our subsidiary, INTL FCStone Markets, LLC) and certain of their counterparties to exchange initial and variation margin, with an implementation period ending in September 2020.\nThe European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (\u201cEMIR\u201d) is the European regulation on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories. EMIR has been implemented across the European Economic Area member states. EMIR has imposed new requirements on our European entities, including (a) reporting derivatives trades to trade repositories; (b) setting up enhanced risk management procedures for OTC derivative transactions; and (c) changes to our clearing account models and increased central counterparty margin requirements. Reporting requirements and most risk mitigation procedures were set at the end of 2013. Implementation of collateral obligations applicable to non-cleared OTC transactions came into force during 2017. ESMA is continuing to evaluate and set clearing obligations for certain OTC derivatives. INTL FCStone Ltd. complies with the enacted provisions and will do so when pending EMIR provisions are finalized as relevant to its activities.\nIn addition to EMIR, European Union financial market legislation MiFID II and MiFIR took effect on January 3, 2018. Principal areas of impact related to these regulatory texts involve the emergence and oversight of organized trading facilities (\u201cOTFs\u201d) for trading OTC non-equity products, client categorization, enhanced investor protection, conflicts of interest and execution policies, transparency obligations and extended transaction reporting requirements. We will continue to monitor all applicable regulatory developments.\nThe increased costs associated with compliance, and the changes that will be required in our OTC and clearing businesses, may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition.\nWe are subject to net capital requirements. The SEC, FINRA and the CFTC require our dually registered broker-dealer/FCM subsidiary, INTL FCStone Financial to maintain specific levels of net capital. Failure to maintain the required net capital may subject this subsidiary to suspension or revocation of registration by the SEC, and suspension or expulsion by FINRA and other regulatory bodies and may subject this subsidiary to limitations on its activities, including suspension or revocation of its registration by the CFTC and suspension or expulsion by the NFA and various exchanges of which it is a member.\nSA Stone Wealth Management Inc. (formerly Sterne Agee Financial Services, Inc.) is subject to the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nThe FCA requires our United Kingdom subsidiary, INTL FCStone Ltd to maintain specific levels of net capital. Failure to maintain the required net capital may subject INTL FCStone Ltd to suspension or revocation of its registration by the FCA.\nThe Australian Securities and Investment Commission regulates INTL FCStone Pty. Ltd. It is subject to a net tangible asset capital requirement.\nThe Brazilian Central Bank and Securities and Exchange Commission of Brazil regulate INTL FCStone DTVM Ltda. and INTL FCStone Banco de Cambio S.A. They are a registered broker-dealer and registered foreign exchange bank, respectively, and are subject to capital adequacy requirements.\nThe Comision Nacional de Valores regulates INTL Gainvest S.A. and INTL CIBSA S.A., and they are subject to net capital and capital adequacy requirements. The Rosario Futures Exchange and the General Inspector of Justice regulate INTL Capital, S.A. It is subject to a capital adequacy requirement.\nCertain of our other non-U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to capital adequacy requirements promulgated by authorities of the countries in which they operate.\nThe CFTC has also proposed capital requirements requiring registered swap dealers (such as our subsidiary, INTL FCStone Markets, LLC) to maintain specific levels of net capital. If implemented as proposed, failure to maintain the required net capital may result in suspension or revocation of registration by the CFTC and suspension or expulsion by the NFA and various exchanges of which it is a member.\nUltimately, any failure to meet capital requirements by our dually registered broker-dealer/FCM subsidiary, or our other broker-dealer subsidiaries, could result in liquidation of the subsidiary. Failure to comply with the net capital rules could have material and adverse consequences such as limiting their operations, or restricting us from withdrawing capital from these subsidiaries.\nFurthermore, a change in the net capital rules, the imposition of new rules or any unusually large charge against net capital could limit our operations that require the intensive use of capital. They could also restrict our ability to withdraw capital from these subsidiaries. Any limitation on our ability to withdraw capital could limit our ability to pay cash dividends, repay debt and repurchase shares of our outstanding stock. A significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our present levels of business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition to the net capital requirements, INTL FCStone Financial Inc. is subject to the deposit and/or collateral requirements of the clearing houses in which it participates (such as The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation and The Options Clearing Corporation). These requirements may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon the nature and size of client trading activity. Failure to meet such requirements could result in our inability to continue to participate in the clearing house, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operation and financial condition.\nWe are subject to margin funding requirements on short notice. Our business involves establishment and carrying of substantial open positions for clients on futures exchanges and in the OTC derivatives markets. We are required to post and maintain margin or credit support for these positions. Although we collect margin or other deposits from our clients for these positions, significant adverse price movements can occur which will require us to post margin or other deposits on short notice, whether or not we are able to collect additional margin or credit support from our clients. We maintain borrowing facilities for the purpose of funding margin and credit support and have systems to endeavor to collect margin and other deposits from clients on a same-day basis; however, there can be no assurance that these facilities and systems will be adequate to eliminate the risk of margin calls in the event of severe adverse price movements affecting open positions of our clients. Generally, if a client is unable to meet its margin call, we promptly liquidate the client\u2019s account. However, there can be no assurance that in each case the liquidation of the account will not result in a loss to us or that liquidation will be feasible, given market conditions, size of the account and tenor of the positions.\nLow short-term interest rates negatively impact our profitability. The level of prevailing short-term interest rates affects our profitability because we derive a portion of our revenue from interest earned from the investment of funds deposited with us by our clients. As of September 30, 2018, we had $2.6 billion in client segregated assets, the majority of which are generally invested in U.S. Treasury securities. In addition, in our correspondent securities clearing business, we earn fee income in lieu of interest income on client cash held in money market mutual funds and FDIC sweep accounts. Our financial performance generally benefits from rising interest rates. Higher interest rates increase the amount of interest income earned from these client deposits. If short-term interest rates remain low or start to decline further, our revenues derived from interest will correspondingly decline which would negatively impact our profitability.\nShort-term interest rates are highly sensitive to factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. In particular, decreases in the federal funds rate by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System usually lead to decreasing interest rates in the U.S., which generally lead to a decrease in short-term interest rates.\nWe may issue additional equity securities. The issuance of additional common stock or securities convertible into our common stock could result in dilution of the ownership interest in us held by existing stockholders. We are authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, a significant number of additional shares of our common stock and securities convertible into either common stock or preferred stock.\nWe are subject to risks relating to litigation and potential securities, commodities and derivatives law liability. We face significant legal risks in our businesses, including risks related to currently pending litigation involving us. Many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability, including liability under federal and state securities, commodities and derivatives laws, other federal, state and foreign laws and court decisions, as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, the\nCFTC, FINRA, the MSRB, the NFA, the FCA and other regulatory bodies. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us and our subsidiaries could have adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. Any such litigation could lead to more volatility of our stock price.\nFor a further discussion of litigation risks, see Item 3 - Legal Proceedings below and Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe are subject to intense competition. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from market-making and trading activities involving securities, commodities and foreign exchange. The market for these services, particularly market-making services through electronic communications gateways, is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. We expect competition to continue and intensify in the future. We compete primarily with wholesale, national, and regional broker-dealers and FCMs, as well as electronic communications networks. We compete primarily on the basis of our expertise and quality of service.\nWe also derive a significant portion of our revenues from commodities risk management services. The commodity risk management industry is very competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify in the future. Our primary competitors in this industry include both large, diversified financial institutions and commodity-oriented businesses, smaller firms that focus on specific products or regional markets and independent FCMs.\nA number of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have. Some of them may:\n\u2022\noffer alternative forms of financial intermediation as a result of superior technology and greater availability of information;\n\u2022\noffer a wider range of services and products than we offer;\n\u2022\nbe larger and better capitalized;\n\u2022\nhave greater name recognition; and\n\u2022\nhave more extensive client bases.\nThese competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities and client requirements. They may also be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities and offer more attractive terms to clients. Recent advances in computing and communications technology are substantially changing the means by which market-making services are delivered, including more direct access on-line to a wide variety of services and information. This has created demand for more sophisticated levels of client service. Providing these services may entail considerable cost without an offsetting increase in revenues. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships or may consolidate to enhance their services and products. New competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and they may acquire significant market share.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our existing clients or attract new clients. The success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and increase our client base. Clients in our market are sensitive to, among other things, the costs of using our services, the quality of the services we offer, the speed and reliability of order execution and the breadth of our service offerings and the products and markets to which we offer access. We may not be able to continue to offer the pricing, service, speed and reliability of order execution or the service, product and market breadth that clients desire. In addition, once our risk management consulting clients have become better educated with regard to sources of risk and the tools available to facilitate the management of this risk and we have provided them with recommended hedging strategies, they may no longer continue paying monthly fees for these services. Furthermore, our existing clients, including IRMP clients, are not generally obligated to use our services and can switch providers of clearing and execution services or decrease their trading activity conducted through us at any time. As a result, we may fail to retain existing clients or be unable to attract new clients. Our failure to maintain or attract clients could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe rely on relationships with introducing brokers for obtaining some of our clients. The failure to maintain and develop additional relationships with introducing brokers could adversely affect our business. We have relationships with introducing brokers who assist us in establishing new client relationships and provide marketing and client service functions for some of our clients. These introducing brokers receive compensation for introducing clients to us. Many of our relationships with introducing brokers are non-exclusive or may be canceled on relatively short notice. In addition, our introducing brokers have no obligation to provide new client relationships or minimum levels of transaction volume. Our failure to maintain these relationships with these introducing brokers, to develop new relationships with introducing brokers or the failure of these introducing brokers to establish and maintain client relationships would result in a loss of revenues, which could adversely affect our business.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and our charter may adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock and make a takeover of us more difficult. We are organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. Certain provisions of Delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. In addition, certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the board to determine the terms of our unissued series of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares of any series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders. As a result, the board can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, because the rights given to the holders of a series of preferred stock may prohibit a merger, reorganization, sale, liquidation or other extraordinary corporate transaction.\nOur stock price is subject to volatility. The market price of our common stock has been and can be expected to be subject to fluctuation as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ntechnological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other companies;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions or conditions specific in specific markets;\n\u2022\nconditions or trends affecting our industry or the economy generally;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nrisk factors and uncertainties set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nBecause of this volatility, we may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts, and the trading prices of our common stock could decline as a result. In addition, any negative change in the public perception of the securities industry could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results.\nFuture sales by existing stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could fall. Such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nOur international operations involve special challenges that we may not be able to meet, which could adversely affect our financial results. We engage in a significant amount of business with clients in the international markets. Certain additional risks are inherent in doing business in international markets, particularly in a regulated industry. These risks include:\n\u2022\nthe inability to manage and coordinate the various regulatory requirements of multiple jurisdictions that are constantly evolving and subject to unexpected change;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in recruiting and retaining personnel, and managing international operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties of debt collection in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights.\nOur operations are subject to the political, legal and economic risks associated with politically unstable and less developed regions of the world, including the risk of war and other international conflicts and actions by governmental authorities, insurgent groups, terrorists and others. We are exposed to risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business in international markets. We may conduct business in countries that are the subject of actual or threatened war, terrorist activity, political instability, civil strife and other geopolitical uncertainty, economic and financial instability, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers, exchange rate fluctuations, applicable currency controls, the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including reliance on local experts. As a result of these and other factors, the currencies of these countries may be unstable. Future instability in such currencies or the imposition of governmental or regulatory restrictions on such currencies or on business in such countries could impede our foreign business.\nOur operations are required to comply with the laws and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory authorities of each country in which we conduct business, and if we violate these regulations, we may be subject to significant penalties. The financial services industry is subject to extensive laws, rules and regulations in every country in which we operate. Firms that engage in commodity futures brokerage, securities and derivatives trading and investment banking must comply with the laws, rules and regulations imposed by the governing country, state, regulatory bodies and self-regulatory bodies with governing authority over such activities. Such laws, rules and regulations cover all aspects of the financial services business, including, but not limited to, sales and trading methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of clients\u2019 funds and securities, capital structure, anti-money laundering and anti-bribery and corruption efforts, recordkeeping and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.\nEach of our regulators supervises our business activities to monitor compliance with such laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdiction. In addition, if there are instances in which our regulators question our compliance with laws, rules, and regulations, they may investigate the facts and circumstances to determine whether we have complied. At any moment in time, we may be subject to one or more such investigation or similar reviews. There can be no assurance that, in the future, the operations of our businesses will not violate such laws, rules, and regulations and that related investigations and similar reviews could result in adverse regulatory requirements, regulatory enforcement actions and/or fines.\nAdditional legislation, changes in rules, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, or the entering into businesses that subject us to new rules and regulations may directly affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are required to comply with U.S. laws and regulations applicable to companies conducting business internationally, and if we violate these laws and regulations, it could adversely affect our business and subject us to broader liability. Our international business operations are subject to various anti-corruption laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d). The FCPA is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect those companies\u2019 transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against designated foreign states, organizations and individuals. Though we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable OFAC sanctions, rules and regulations as well as the FCPA and equivalent laws and rules of other jurisdictions, there can be no assurance that, in the future, the operations of our businesses will not violate these laws and regulations, and we could be exposed to claims for damages, financial penalties, reputational harm, incarceration of employees and restrictions on our operations and cash flows.\nThe U.K.\u2019s proposed withdrawal from the European Union could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. On March 29, 2017, the U.K. government triggered the article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d). This officially confirmed the U.K.\u2019s intention withdraw its membership to the E.U. and the start for a two year negotiation process where the U.K. and the E.U. need to agree the terms of the withdrawal and potentially give consideration to the future of the relationship between the parties. Current uncertainty over whether the U.K. will ultimately leave the E.U., as well as the final outcome of the negotiations between the U.K. and E.U., could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on the terms negotiated between the U.K. and the E.U., which may take years to complete. Our operations in the U.K. as well as our global operations could be impacted by the global economic uncertainty caused by Brexit or the actual withdrawal by the U.K. from the E.U. If we are unable to manage any of these risks effectively, our business could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 81254, "SIC": 6200, "TIC": "SNEX"}
