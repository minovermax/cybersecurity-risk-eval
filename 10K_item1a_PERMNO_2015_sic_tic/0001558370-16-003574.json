Risk Factors.\nSignificant factors that could impact the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations include, without limitation, the following:\n\u00b7\nRisk of changes in the price and availability of raw materials - The principal ingredients used by the Company are subject to price volatility. Although the Company engages in commodity hedging transactions and annual supply agreements as well as leveraging the high volume of its annual purchases, the Company may experience price increases in these ingredients that it may not be able to offset, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, although the Company has historically been able to procure sufficient supplies of its ingredients, market conditions could change such that adequate supplies might not be available or only become available at substantially higher costs. Adverse weather patterns, including the effects of climate change, could also significantly affect the cost and availability of these ingredients.\n\u00b7\nRisk of changes in product performance and competition - The Company competes with other well-established manufacturers of confectionery products. A failure of new or existing products to be favorably received, a failure to retain preferred shelf space at retail or a failure to sufficiently counter aggressive promotional and price competition could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\u00b7\nRisk of discounting and other competitive actions - Discounting and pricing pressure by the Company\u2019s retail customers and other competitive actions could make it more difficult for the Company to maintain its operating margins. Actions taken by major customers and competitors may make shelf space less available for confectionary products or some of the Company\u2019s products.\n\u00b7\nRisk of pricing actions - Inherent risks in the marketplace, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of pricing actions or product weight changes could make it more difficult for the Company to maintain its sales and operating margins.\n\u00b7\nRisk related to seasonality - The Company\u2019s sales are highest during the Halloween season. Adverse circumstances surrounding Halloween, such as widespread weather events at that time of year or general changes in consumer interest in Halloween could significantly affect the Company\u2019s sales.\n\u00b7\nRisk of dependence on large customers - The Company\u2019s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 23.7% of net product sales in 2015, and other large national chains are also material to the Company\u2019s sales. The loss of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or one or more other large customers, or a material decrease in purchases by one or more large customers, could result in decreased sales and adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\u00b7\nRisk of changes in consumer preferences and tastes - Failure to adequately anticipate and react to changing demographics, consumer trends, consumer health concerns and product preferences, including product ingredients, could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\u00b7\nRisk of economic conditions on consumer purchases - The Company\u2019s sales are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence, employment levels, disposable income, availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit, consumer debt levels, energy costs and other factors. Volatility in food and energy costs, rising unemployment and/or underemployment, declines in personal spending, and recessionary economic conditions could adversely impact the Company\u2019s revenues, profitability and financial condition.\n\u00b7\nRisks related to environmental matters - The Company\u2019s operations are not particularly impactful on the environment, but increased government environmental regulation or legislation could adversely impact the Company\u2019s profitability.\n\u00b7\nRisks relating to participation in the multi-employer pension plan for certain Company union employees - As outlined in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and discussed in the Management\u2019s Discussion & Analysis- , the Company participates in a multi-employer pension plan (Plan) which is currently in \u201ccritical and declining status\u201d, as defined by applicable law. A designation of \u201ccritical and declining status\u201d implies that the Plan is expected to become insolvent in the next 20 years. Under terms of a rehabilitation plan, the Company is to be assessed 5% annual compounded surcharges on its contributions to the Plan until such time as the Plan emerges from critical status. Should the Company withdraw from the Plan, it would subject to a significant withdrawal liability which is discussed in Note 7 of the Company\u2019s Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is currently unable to determine the ultimate outcome of this matter and therefore, is unable to determine the effects on its consolidated financial statements, but, the ultimate outcome could be material to its consolidated results of operations in one or more future periods.\n\u00b7\nRisk of new governmental laws and regulations - Governmental laws and regulations, including those that affect food advertising and marketing, including products for children, use of ingredients in products, including the use of hydrogenated oils, new labeling requirements, income and other taxes and tariffs, including those targeted toward confectionery products, and the environment, both in and outside the U.S., are subject to change over time, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and ability to compete in domestic or foreign marketplaces.\n\u00b7\nRisk of labor stoppages - To the extent the Company experiences any significant labor stoppages, such disputes or strikes could negatively affect shipments from suppliers or shipments of finished product.\n\u00b7\nRisk of impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets - In accordance with authoritative guidance, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to an impairment evaluation annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Other long-lived assets are likewise tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Such evaluations are based on assumptions and variables including sales growth, profit margins and discount rates. Adverse changes in any of these variables could affect the carrying value of these intangible assets and the Company\u2019s reported profitability.\n\u00b7\nRisk of the cost of energy increasing - Higher energy costs would likely result in higher distribution, freight and other operating costs. The Company may not be able to offset these cost increases or pass such cost increases onto customers in the form of price increases, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\u00b7\nRisk of a product recall - Issues related to the quality and safety of the Company\u2019s products could result in a voluntary or involuntary large-scale product recall. Costs associated with a product recall and related litigation or fines, and marketing costs relating to the re-launch of such products or brands, could negatively affect operating results. In addition, negative publicity associated with this type of event, including a product recall relating to\nproduct contamination or product tampering, whether valid or not, could negatively impact future demand for the Company\u2019s products.\n\u00b7\nRisk of operational interruptions relating to computer software or hardware failures - The Company is reliant on computer systems to operate its business. Software failure or corruption, including cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, or catastrophic hardware failures or other disasters could disrupt communications, supply chain planning and activities relating to sales demand forecasts, materials procurement, production and inventory planning, customer shipments, and financial and accounting, all of which could negatively impact sales and profits.\n\u00b7\nRisk of releasing sensitive information - Although the Company does not maintain a large amount of sensitive data, a system breach, whether inadvertent or perpetrated by hackers, could result in identity theft which could expose the Company to financial costs and adversely affect profitability.\n\u00b7\nRisk of production interruptions - The majority of the Company\u2019s products are manufactured in a single production facility on specialized equipment. In the event of a disaster, such as a fire or earthquake, at a specific plant location, it would be difficult to transfer production to other facilities or a new location in a timely manner, which could result in loss of market share for the affected products. In addition, from time to time, the Company upgrades or replaces this specialized equipment. In many cases these are integrated and complex installations. A failure or delay in implementing such an installation could impact the availability of one or more of the Company\u2019s products which would have an adverse impact on sales and profits.\n\u00b7\nRisk related to international operations - To the extent there is political or social unrest, civil war, terrorism or significant economic instability in the countries in which the Company operates, the results of the Company\u2019s business in such countries could be adversely impacted. Currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could also have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s principal markets are the U.S.A., Canada, and Mexico.\n\u00b7\nRisk related to investments in marketable securities - The Company invests its surplus cash in a diversified portfolio of highly rated marketable securities, including corporate and tax exempt municipal bonds, with maturities of generally up to three years. Nonetheless, such investments could become impaired in the event of certain adverse economic and/or geopolitical events which, if severe, would adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition.\n\u00b7\nDisruption to the Company\u2019s supply chain could impair Company\u2019s ability to produce or deliver its finished products, resulting in a negative impact on operating results - Disruption to the manufacturing operations or supply chain, some of which are discussed above, could result from, but are not limited to natural disasters, pandemic outbreak of disease, weather, fire or explosion, terrorism or other acts of violence, unavailability of ingredients or packaging materials, labor strikes or other labor activities, operational and/or financial instability of key suppliers, and other vendors or service providers. Although precautions are taken to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions, if the Company is unable, or if it is not financially feasible, to effectively mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such disruptive events, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\n\u00b7\nRisk related to acquisitions - From time to time, the Company has purchased other confectionery companies or brands. These acquisitions generally come at a high multiple of earnings and are justified based on various assumptions related to sales growth, and operating margins. Were the Company to make another acquisition and be unable to achieve the assumed sales and operating margins, it could have an adverse impact on future sales and profits. In addition it could become necessary to record an impairment which would have a further adverse impact on reported profits.\n\u00b7\nRisk of further losses in Spain - The Company has restructured its Spanish subsidiaries and is exploring a variety of programs to increase sales and profitability. However, the outcome of these efforts is uncertain and additional losses could be reported from these business units.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is a controlled company due to the common stock holdings of the Gordon family - The Gordon family\u2019s share ownership represents a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of the Company\u2019s common stock as of December 31, 2015. As a result, the Gordon family has the power to elect the Company\u2019s directors and approve actions requiring the approval of the shareholders of the Company.\nThe factors identified above are believed to be significant factors, but not necessarily all of the significant factors, that could impact the Company\u2019s business. Unpredictable or unknown factors could also have material effects on the Company.\nAdditional significant factors that may affect the Company\u2019s operations, performance and business results include the risks and uncertainties listed from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the risk factors or uncertainties listed herein or listed in any document incorporated by reference herein.", "PERMNO": 14816, "SIC": 2060, "TIC": "TR"}
