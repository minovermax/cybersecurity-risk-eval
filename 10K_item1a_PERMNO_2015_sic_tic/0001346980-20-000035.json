RISK FACTORS\nThe following are some of the important factors that could affect our financial performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in our forward-looking statements. We may encounter risks in addition to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also impair or adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Gas Industry and Our Business\nOur development, acquisition and exploration operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves.\nTo increase reserves and production, we undertake development, exploration and other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish these activities. We have made and expect to make in the future substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the development, production, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves.\nHistorically, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations, the issuance of securities and borrowings under our bank and other credit facilities. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022\nour proved reserves;\n\u2022\nthe volume of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022\nthe prices at which oil and natural gas are sold;\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce economically new reserves; and\n\u2022\nour ability to borrow under our credit facility.\nWe cannot assure you that our operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures. In the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of capital we have available, we could be required to seek additional sources of capital, which may include traditional reserve base borrowings, debt financing, joint venture partnerships, production payment financings, sales of assets, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nIf we are unable to fund our capital requirements, we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves, or we may be otherwise unable to implement our development plan, complete acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.\nConcerns over general economic, business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nConcerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit, the European, Asian and the United States financial markets have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. In addition, continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the global economy. These factors, combined with volatility in commodity prices, business and consumer confidence and unemployment rates, may precipitate an economic slowdown. Concerns about global economic growth may have an adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad deteriorates, worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish, which could impact the price at which we can sell our production, affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers and customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nA decline in oil and gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition, financial results, liquidity, cash flows, access to capital and ability to grow.\nOur future financial condition, revenues, results of operations, rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production. Oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current geopolitical conditions. This price volatility also affects the cash flow we will have available for capital expenditures as well as our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. The prices for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of factors that are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe domestic and foreign supply of oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u2022\ncommodity processing, gathering and transportation availability, and the availability of refining capacity;\n\u2022\nthe price and level of foreign imports and exports of oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the members of OPEC to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022\nthe supply of other inputs necessary to our production;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuel sources;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption and supply;\n\u2022\nweather conditions, seasonal trends and natural disasters and other extraordinary events;\n\u2022\nfinancial and commercial market uncertainty;\n\u2022\nenergy conservation and environmental measures;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions or hostilities in oil and natural gas producing regions, including the Middle East, Russia, and South America;\n\u2022\nworldwide economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nglobal or national health concerns, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as the coronavirus.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets generally make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and gas price movements with any certainty. During the past five years, the posted price for West Texas Intermediate light sweet crude oil, which we refer to as WTI, has ranged from a low of $26.19 per Bbl in February 2016 to a high of $77.41 per Bbl in June 2018. The Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of $1.49 per MMBtu in March 2016 to a high of $6.24 per MMBtu in January 2018. During 2019, WTI prices ranged from $46.31 to $66.24 per Bbl and the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from $1.75 to $4.25 per MMBtu. Up to the time of this filing, in March 2020, spot prices for WTI ranged from a high of\n$48.66 to a low of $27.34 per Bbl. If the prices of oil and natural gas remain at current levels or decline further, our operations, financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves may be materially and adversely affected.\nExtended periods of lower oil and natural gas prices will reduce our revenue but also will reduce the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce economically, and as a result, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and reserves. During periods of low commodity prices we may shut in or curtail production from additional wells and defer drilling new wells, challenging our ability to produce at commercially paying quantities required to hold our leases. A reduction in production could result in a shortfall in our expected cash flows and require us to reduce our capital spending or borrow funds to cover any such shortfall. Any of these factors could negatively impact our ability to replace our production and our future rate of growth.\nA decline in prices from current levels may lead to additional write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties in the future which could negatively impact results of operations.\nWe utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our oil and natural gas properties. Under this method, all costs incurred for both productive and nonproductive properties are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis using the units-of-production method. However, these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of estimated future net revenues attributable to proved oil and natural gas reserves discounted at 10% net of tax considerations, plus the market value of unproved properties not being amortized. The full cost ceiling is evaluated at the end of each quarter using the SEC prices for oil and natural gas in effect at that date. A write-down of oil and natural gas properties does not impact cash flow from operating activities, but does reduce net income. Once incurred, a write-down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date. We recorded ceiling test write-downs of $431 million, $20 million and $42 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices and other factors, without mitigating circumstances, could require us to further write down capitalized costs and incur corresponding noncash charges to earnings. Since the prices used in the cost ceiling are based on a trailing twelve-month period, the full impact of a sudden price decline is not recognized immediately.\nOn December 20, 2019, two directors resigned from our Board and three new directors were appointed, and we had a change in our CEO position. The transition in our new board composition and CEO position will be critical to our success.\nIn connection with the Amended SVP Agreement, on December 20, 2019, the authorized number of directors on the Board was increased from seven to eight, K. Earl Reynolds and Matthew D. Cabell resigned as directors, and Charles Duginski, Michael Kuharski and Mark \u201cMac\u201d McFarland were appointed as directors. Additionally, Mr. Reynolds resigned as the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and President and Mr. Duginski was appointed to that role. The ability of these new directors and this new CEO to quickly expand their knowledge of our business plans, operations and strategies and our technologies will be critical to their ability to make informed decisions about our strategy and operations. If such persons are not sufficiently informed to make such decisions, our ability to compete effectively and profitably could be adversely affected. Further, if our Board and new CEO formulate different or changed views, the future strategy and plans of the Company may differ materially from those of the past.\nThe ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to the success of our business. Any difficulty we experience replacing or adding personnel could adversely affect our business.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced professional personnel. The loss of any key executives or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We may need to enter into retention or other arrangements that could be costly to maintain. If executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated, or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner and we could experience significant declines in productivity.\nOur producing properties are predominantly located in Oklahoma where our development opportunities, consisting of our inventory of drilling locations, are geographically concentrated in the STACK play in Oklahoma. We are therefore vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area. In addition, we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area.\nAt December 31, 2019, 82% of our proved reserves and 82% of our total equivalent production for 2019 were attributable our properties located in the STACK. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the risk and impact of regional supply and demand factors, state and local political forces and governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, severe weather events or other natural disasters, water shortages or other conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas or NGLs in the region. These factors could have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows than if our properties were more diversified.\nIn addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above, as of December 31, 2019, 70% of all of our proved reserves were attributable to the Meramec and Osage formations in the STACK. This concentration of assets within a small number of producing horizons exposes us to additional risks, such as changes in field-wide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shut in all of our wells within a field.\nA significant portion of total proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 are undeveloped, and those reserves may not ultimately be developed.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 33% of our estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped. These reserve estimates reflect our plans to make significant capital expenditures to convert our proved undeveloped reserves into proved developed reserves at a total estimated undiscounted cost of $259.3 million. You should be aware that actual development costs may exceed estimates, development may not occur as scheduled and results may not be as estimated. If we choose not to develop our proved undeveloped reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop them, we will be required to remove the associated volumes from our reported proved reserves.\nDevelopment and exploration drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves.\nDrilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that commercially productive reservoirs will not be encountered. We cannot assure you that new wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or may be economically recovered and/or produced. Drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit at then-realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. These risks are magnified when operating in an environment of low crude oil prices. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\nsurface access restrictions;\n\u2022\npressure or lost circulation in formations;\n\u2022\nfires, blowouts and explosions;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\ndecline in commodity prices;\n\u2022\nlimited availability of financing on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\npolitical events, public protests, civil disturbances, regional or global health pandemics, terrorist acts or cyber-attacks;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nnaturally occurring or induced seismic activity;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, equipment and services.\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to economically recover reserves through our exploration and drilling activities, our results of operations, cash flows, growth, and reserve replenishment may be materially affected.\nThe actual quantities and present value of our proved reserves may be lower than we have estimated.\nEstimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process. The quantities and values of our proved reserves in the projections are only estimates and subject to numerous uncertainties. The accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. These estimates depend on assumptions regarding quantities and production rates of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves, future prices for oil and natural gas, timing and amounts of development expenditures and operating expenses, all of which will vary from those assumed in our estimates. If the variances in these assumptions are significant, many of which are based upon extrinsic events we cannot control, they could significantly affect these estimates, which in turn could have a negative effect on the value of our assets. Any significant variance from the assumptions used could result in the actual amounts of oil and natural gas ultimately recovered and future net cash flows being materially different from the estimates in our reserves reports. In addition, results of drilling, testing, production, and changes in prices after the date of the estimates of our reserves may result in substantial downward revisions. These estimates may not accurately predict the present value of future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas reserves. In addition, from time to time in the future, we will adjust estimates of proved reserves, potentially in material amounts, to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, changes in oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nYou should not assume that the present values referred to in this report represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The timing of production and expenses associated with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value. In accordance with requirements of the SEC, the estimates of present values are based on a twelve-month average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the twelve-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of these estimates. Our December 31, 2019 reserve report used SEC pricing of $2.58 per Mcf for natural gas and $55.69 per Bbl for oil.\nThe present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines are not the same as the current market value of our estimated reserves.\nWe base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on 12-month average index prices and costs, as is required by SEC rules and regulations. Actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by actual prices we receive for oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as other factors such as:\n\u2022the accuracy of our reserve estimates;\n\u2022the actual cost of development and production expenditures;\n\u2022the amount and timing of actual production;\n\u2022supply of and demand for oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022changes in governmental regulation or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, we use a 10% discount factor when calculating discounted future net cash flows, which may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nOur use of 2-D and 3-D seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations.\nEven when properly used and interpreted, 2-D and 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. In addition, the use of 3-D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures. As a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical.\nThe predictability of our operating results and our future development plans may be affected by the results of multi-well pad drilling.\nWe drill multi-well spacing test patterns in the STACK play. These projects, which are capital intensive, involve horizontal multi-well pad drilling, tighter drill spacing and completions techniques that evolve over time as lessons learned are captured and applied. The use of this technique may increase the risk of unintentional communication with other adjacent wells and the potential to reduce total recoverable reserves from the reservoir. Problems affecting a single well could adversely affect production from all of the wells on the pad or in the entire project. Furthermore, additional time is required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing. As a result, multi-well pad drilling and project development can cause delays in the scheduled commencement of production or interruptions in ongoing production. These delays or interruptions may cause declines or volatility in our operating results due to timing. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues and could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nFurther, we may, after consolidating lessons learned regarding the variability and complexity of relevant geology as well as spacing within a reservoir, elect to sacrifice a portion of our drilling locations to both mitigate near term operational risk and address financial goals. For example, we may not co-develop certain locations within a drilling unit at the same time other locations are drilled because those we are forgoing do not meet our return on investment criteria in today\u2019s pricing environment. Locations not simultaneously developed within the same drilling unit may not be economic to drill in the future absent significant improvement in commodity prices. In this regard, it is important to note that oil and NGL prices have a direct impact on which wells we drill and which locations we target at any given time.\nIf we are not able to replace reserves, we may not be able to sustain production.\nOur future success depends largely upon our ability to efficiently develop and exploit our current estimated reserves and find or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful development, exploration or acquisition activities, our proved reserves and production will decline over time. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. Our December 31, 2019, reserve estimates reflect that our production rate on current proved developed producing reserve properties will decline at annual rates of approximately 29%, 18%, and 14% for the next three years. Thus, our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically discovering or acquiring additional recoverable reserves.\nWe cannot control the activities on properties we do not operate and we are unable to ensure the proper operation, profitability or other impacts of these non-operated properties.\nWe do not operate all of the properties in which we have an interest. For example, as of December 31, 2019, properties representing approximately 26% of our proved developed reserves are operated by third parties. As a result, we have limited ability to exercise influence over, and control the risks associated with, the operation of these properties. The success and timing of drilling and development activities on our partially owned properties operated by others therefore will depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the operator\u2019s:\n\u2022timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022expertise and diligence in adequately performing operations and complying with applicable agreements;\n\u2022financial resources;\n\u2022inclusion of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u2022use of technology.\nFurther, it is possible that an operator of a nearby property may perform stimulation operations that negatively affect properties in which we have an interest. As a result of any of the above or an operator\u2019s failure to act in ways that are in our best interest, our allocated production revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf the third parties we rely on for gathering and distributing our oil and natural gas are unable to meet our needs for such services and facilities, our future exploration and production activities could be adversely affected.\nThe marketability of our production depends upon the proximity of our reserves to, and the capacity of, third-party facilities and third-party services, including oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines, trucking or terminal facilities, and refineries or processing facilities. The lack of available capacity on such third-party systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production. Further, such third parties are subject to federal and state regulation of the production and transportation of oil and natural gas. If such third parties are unable to comply with such regulations and we are unable to replace such service and facilities providers, we may be required to shut in producing wells or delay or discontinue development plans for our properties. A shut-in, delay or discontinuance could adversely affect our financial conditions.\nShortages of oil field equipment and services could reduce our cash flow and adversely affect results of operations.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages in such personnel. The severe industry decline that began in mid-2014 resulted in a large displacement of experienced personnel through layoffs and many of the affected personnel moved on to careers in other industries. This structural shift in available workforce may be impactful in future periods. During future periods where there may be increased demand for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, oilfield equipment and services, and personnel, we may encounter shortages of these resources, as well as increased prices. These types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin, cash flow and operating results and/or restrict or delay our ability to drill those wells and conduct those operations that we currently have planned and budgeted, causing us to miss our forecasts and projections.\nLimitations or restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur operations require significant amounts of water for drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to obtain water from local sources may require us to find remote sources. In addition, treatment and disposal of such water after use is becoming more highly regulated and restricted. Thus, costs for obtaining and disposing of water could increase significantly, potentially limiting our ability to engage in hydraulic fracturing. This could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nWe operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas production, acquisition, development, and exploration, and we face intense competition from both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies:\n\u2022seeking to acquire desirable producing properties or new leases for future development or exploration; and\n\u2022seeking to acquire similar equipment and expertise that we deem necessary to operate and develop our properties.\nMany of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours, and some of them are fully integrated oil companies. These companies may be able to pay more for development prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices. Our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to develop our oil and natural gas properties and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to successfully conduct operations, select suitable prospects and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment.\nWe can also be affected by competition for drilling rigs and the availability of related equipment. In the past, the oil and natural gas industry has experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel that have delayed developmental drilling and other exploitation activities and have caused significant price increases. We are unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may again occur or how they would affect our development and exploitation program.\nWe are responsible for the decommissioning, abandonment, and reclamation costs for our facilities.\nWe are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the decommissioning, abandonment and reclamation of our facilities at the end of their economic life, the costs of which may be substantial. Although we make estimates of such costs and record the associated liability on our balance sheet, there is no assurance that our cost estimates will coincide with actual costs when the remediation work takes place. The timing and amount of costs is difficult to predict with certainty since they will be a function of regulatory requirements at the time of decommissioning, abandonment and reclamation. We may, in the future, determine it prudent or be required by applicable laws or regulations to establish and fund one or more decommissioning, abandonment and reclamation reserve funds to provide for payment of future decommissioning, abandonment and reclamation costs, which could decrease funds available to service debt obligations. In addition, such reserves, if established, may not be sufficient to satisfy such future decommissioning, abandonment and reclamation costs and we will be responsible for the payment of the balance of such costs.\nCosts of environmental liabilities could exceed our estimates and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur operations are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, which obligate us to install and maintain pollution controls and to clean up various sites at which regulated materials may have been disposed of or released. It is not possible for us to estimate reliably the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of:\n\u2022the uncertainties in estimating cleanup costs;\n\u2022the discovery of additional contamination or contamination more widespread than previously thought;\n\u2022the uncertainty in quantifying liability under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties;\n\u2022new listing of species as \u201cthreatened\u201d or \u201cendangered\u201d;\n\u2022changes in interpretation and enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations; and\n\u2022future changes to environmental laws and regulations and their enforcement.\nAlthough we believe we have established appropriate reserves for known liabilities, including cleanup costs, we could be required to set aside additional reserves in the future due to these uncertainties, incur material cleanup costs, other liabilities, and/or expend significant sums to defend ourselves against litigation related to legacy environmental issues, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nOil and natural gas drilling and production operations can be hazardous and may expose us to uninsurable losses or other liabilities.\nOil and natural gas operations are subject to many risks, including well blowouts, cratering, explosions, pipe failure, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids, hydraulic fracturing fluids, toxic gas\nor other pollutants and other environmental and safety hazards and risks. Our drilling operations involve risks from high pressures and from mechanical difficulties such as stuck pipes, collapsed casings and separated cables. If any of these events occur, we could sustain substantial losses as a result of:\n\u2022injury or loss of life;\n\u2022severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022pollution or other environmental damage;\n\u2022remediation and cleanup responsibilities;\n\u2022regulatory investigations and administrative, civil and criminal penalties;\n\u2022damage to our reputation; and\n\u2022injunctions or other proceedings that suspend, limit or prohibit operations.\nOur liability for environmental hazards sometimes includes those created on properties prior to the date we acquired or leased them. While we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above, our insurance may not be adequate to cover any or all resulting losses or liabilities. Moreover, if we experience more insurable events, our annual premiums may increase further or we may not be able to obtain any such insurance on commercially reasonable terms. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, certain risks may not be fully insurable. The occurrence of, or failure or inability by us to obtain or maintain adequate insurance coverage for, any of the events listed above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as our growth, exploration, and employee recruitment activities.\nResolution of litigation could materially affect our financial position and results of operations or result in dilution to existing stockholders.\nWe have been named as a defendant in certain lawsuits. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. In some of these suits, our liability for potential loss upon resolution may be mitigated by insurance coverage. To the extent that potential exposure to liability is not covered by insurance or insurance coverage is inadequate, we could incur losses that could be material to our financial position or results of operations in future periods. Additionally, we are parties to certain litigation initiated prior to our emergence from bankruptcy, and pursuant to the Reorganization Plan, liability arising under judgment or settlement related to certain of these claims would be satisfied through the issuance of stock which could result in dilution to existing stockholders. We may also become involved in litigation over certain issues related to the Reorganization Plan, including the proposed treatment of certain claims thereunder. The outcome of such litigation could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in future periods.\nWe may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions and divestitures.\nThe successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including recoverable reserves, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and liabilities. The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain and we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. Even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms.\nAcquiring oil and natural gas properties requires us to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics, including recoverable reserves, development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain. In connection with the assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties, but such a review will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems. In the course of our due diligence, we may not inspect every well or pipeline. We cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems, such as pipe corrosion, when an inspection is made. We may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities created prior to our purchase of the property. We may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations.\nCompetition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. Our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and, in some cases, regulatory approvals. Further, these acquisitions may be in geographic regions in which we do not currently operate, which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations, personnel and facilities. In addition, if we enter into new geographic markets, we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements. Compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management, cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for non-compliance with such additional legal requirements. Further, the success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. In addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions.\nNo assurance can be given that we will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions, could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations, which, in turn, could negatively impact our earnings and growth.\nIn addition, we may sell non-core assets in order to increase capital resources available for other core assets and to create organizational and operational efficiencies. We may also occasionally sell interests in core assets for the purpose of accelerating the development and increasing efficiencies in such core assets. Various factors could materially affect our ability to dispose of such assets, including the approvals of governmental agencies or third parties and the availability of purchasers willing to acquire the assets with terms we deem acceptable.\nAny inability to maintain our current derivative positions in the future specifically could result in financial losses or could reduce our income and cash flows.\nOur results of operations, financial condition and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of, and demand for, oil and natural gas. These commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties. To mitigate a portion of this exposure, we enter into commodity price swaps, collars, put options, enhanced swaps and basis protection swaps. While the use of derivative contracts may limit or reduce the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future benefits from favorable price movements and expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances.\nOur use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses or reduce our income.\nOur commodity hedges currently consist of fixed price swaps, basis swaps and collars with financial institutions. The volumes and average notional prices of these hedges are disclosed in in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this report.\nDerivative instruments expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022our production is less than expected;\n\u2022the counterparty to the derivative instruments defaults on its contractual obligations; or\n\u2022\nthere is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the derivative instruments.\nDerivatives also expose us to risk of income reduction as derivative instruments may limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas. Additionally, none of our derivatives are classified as hedges for accounting purposes and therefore must be adjusted to fair value through income each reporting period.\nWhile the primary purpose of our derivative transactions is to protect ourselves against the volatility in oil and natural gas prices, under certain circumstances, or if hedges are discontinued, or terminated for any reason, we may incur substantial losses in closing out our positions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables, including receivables from commodity derivative contracts and purchasers of production, as well as joint interest receivables from joint interest owners in the wells we operate.\nIn addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts, we are exposed to risk of financial loss in connection with our receivables from oil and natural gas purchasers which are generally uncollateralized. We generally review our oil and natural gas purchasers for credit worthiness and general financial condition. However, there is a possibility that some of our purchasers may experience credit downgrades or liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us. Additionally, we are exposed to credit risk in connection with receivables arising from joint interest owners that own partial interests in the wells we operate. These entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill. We are generally unable to control which co-owners participate in our wells.\nThe inability or failure of our oil and natural gas purchasers or our joint interest owners to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency of liquidation may materially adversely affect our financial results.\nUnusual weather patterns or natural disasters, whether due to climate change or otherwise, could negatively impact our financial condition.\nOur business depends, in part, on normal weather patterns across the United States. Natural gas demand and prices are particularly susceptible to seasonal weather trends. Warmer than usual winters can result in reduced demand and high season-end storage volumes, which can depress prices to unacceptably low levels. In addition, because a majority of our properties are located in Oklahoma, our operations are constantly at risk of extreme adverse weather conditions such as freezing rain, tornadoes, drought, and hurricanes. Any unusual or prolonged adverse weather patterns in our areas of operations or markets, whether due to climate change or otherwise, could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and cash flow. In addition, our business, financial condition and cash flow could be adversely affected if the businesses of our key vendors, purchasers, contractors, suppliers or transportation service providers were disrupted due to severe weather, such as freezing rain, hurricanes or floods, whether due to climate change or otherwise.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. In addition, other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology, it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nWe are subject to certain requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, our investors may lose confidence in our reported information and our stock price may be negatively affected.\nWe are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d). Section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. This section also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm opine on those internal controls. If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain of our exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information and in many other activities related to our business. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production, and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology.\nOur technologies, systems networks, and those of our business partners, may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the disruption of our business operations. For example, unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions in our drilling or production operations. To date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks, however there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance their protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cyber vulnerabilities. A cyber incident could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.\nAlthough we take the steps customary in the oil and natural gas industry to review title and perform any curative work with respect to any title defects, our failure to completely cure any title defects may invalidate our title to the subject property and adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves. Any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest can render a lease worthless and may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nPrior to the drilling of an oil or natural gas well, however, it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well. Frequently, as a result of such examinations, certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title, and such curative work entails expense. Our failure to cure any title defects may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest, which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our Credit Agreement and Senior Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had total indebtedness of $422.0 million. Our current and future indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nour high level of indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;\n\u2022\nthe restrictions imposed on the operation of our business by the terms of our debt agreements may hinder our ability to take advantage of strategic opportunities to grow our business;\n\u2022\nthe restrictions imposed on the operation of our business by the terms of our debt agreements may limit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, restructuring, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired, which could be exacerbated by further volatility in the credit markets;\n\u2022\nwe must use a material portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our Senior Notes, borrowings under our Credit Agreement and our other indebtedness, which will reduce the funds available to us for operations and other purposes;\n\u2022\nour high level of indebtedness could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited;\n\u2022\nour high level of indebtedness makes us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business;\n\u2022\nwe may be vulnerable to interest rate increases, as our borrowings under our Credit Agreement are at variable rates; and\n\u2022\nour substantial level of indebtedness may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants in our debt arrangements.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy our obligations under our Credit Agreement.\nWe may incur substantially more debt. This could exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the terms of our Credit Agreement and the Indenture governing our Senior Notes, including under our Credit Agreement, through the issuance of additional notes or otherwise. As of December 31, 2019, the maximum facility amount under the Credit Agreement was $750 million, the borrowing base was $325 million and we had $194.4 million of available borrowing capacity thereunder. Our borrowing base is redetermined by the banks semi-annually effective May 1 and November 1 of each year. In addition, both we and the banks may request a borrowing base redetermination once between each scheduled redetermination.\nIf new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we face could intensify. Our level of indebtedness may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us by limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, limiting our flexibility in operating our business or otherwise. In addition, we could be at a competitive disadvantage against other less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow to devote to their business. Additionally, interest rates on such future indebtedness may be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly.\nRestrictive covenants in our Credit Agreement and Senior Notes could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests.\nOur Credit Agreement and our Indenture for our Senior Notes impose operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability and that of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake investments or loans;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nconsummate mergers and similar fundamental changes;\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake investments in unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates.\nThese restrictions could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to plan for, or react to, market conditions, to meet capital needs or otherwise to restrict our activities or business plan; and\n\u2022\nadversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nOur Credit Agreement includes provisions that require mandatory prepayment of outstanding borrowings and/or a borrowing base redetermination when we make asset dispositions over a certain threshold, which could limit our ability to generate liquidity from asset sales. Also, our Credit Agreement and Senior Notes require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests. These financial ratio restrictions and financial condition tests could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a continued downturn in our business or a downturn in the economy in general, or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. Our ability to comply with these ratios and financial condition tests may be affected by events beyond our control and, as a result, we may be unable to meet these ratios and financial condition tests. Our potential inability to meet financial covenants could require us to refinance or amend such obligations resulting in the payment of consent fees or higher interest rates, or require us to raise additional capital at an inopportune time or on terms not favorable to us.\nA breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or financial condition tests could result in a default under our Credit Agreement or Senior Notes. A default under our Credit Agreement or Senior Notes, if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of all indebtedness outstanding thereunder, which in turn would trigger cross-acceleration and cross-default rights under our other debt.\nIf our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If our debt is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nWe may not be able to achieve our projected financial results or service our debt.\nAlthough our financial projections represent our view based on current known facts and assumptions about the future operations of the Company, there is no guarantee that the financial projections will be realized. Our financial performance is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to meet the projected financial results or achieve projected revenues and cash flows assumed in projecting future business prospects. To the extent we do not meet the projected financial results or achieve projected revenues and cash flows, we may lack sufficient liquidity to continue operating as planned or may be unable to service our debt obligations as they come due or may not be able to meet our operational needs. Any one of these failures may preclude us from, among other things: (a) taking advantage of future opportunities; (b) growing our businesses; or (c) responding to future changes in the oil and gas industry. Further, our failure to meet the projected financial results or achieve projected revenues and cash flows could lead to cash flow and working capital constraints, which constraints may require us to seek additional working capital. We may not be able to obtain such working capital when it is required.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our long-term indebtedness, we will be in default and, as a result:\n\u2022\ndebt holders, including the holders of our Senior Notes, could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable;\n\u2022\nwe may be in default under our master derivative contracts and counter-parties could demand early termination;\n\u2022\nthe lenders under our Credit Agreement could terminate their commitments to loan us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings;\n\u2022\nour credit rating could be lowered, which could inhibit our ability to incur additional indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nwe could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to repay bank borrowings if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination.\nAvailability under our Credit Agreement is subject to a borrowing base, set at $325.0 million as of December 2019, and which is redetermined by the banks semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. In addition, the banks may request a borrowing base redetermination once between each scheduled redetermination. Dispositions of our oil and natural gas assets, early terminations of our derivative contracts, or incurrence of permitted senior additional debt may also trigger automatic reductions in our borrowing base. If the outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of a redetermination, we would be required to eliminate this deficiency. Within 10 days after receiving notice of the new borrowing base, we would be required to make an election: (1) to repay the deficiency in a lump sum within 45 days or (2) commencing within 30 days to repay the deficiency in equal monthly installments over a six -month period or (3) to submit within 45 days additional oil and gas properties we own for consideration in connection with the determination of the borrowing base sufficient to eliminate the deficiency or (4) any combination of repayment as provided in the preceding three elections. If we are forced to repay a portion of our bank borrowings, we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments. If we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing, we may have to sell significant assets. Asset sales may also reduce available collateral and availability under the Credit Agreement and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, we cannot be certain that our cash flow will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations.\nWe are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks.\nOur future success depends on our ability to access capital markets and obtain financing on reasonable terms. Our ability to access financial markets and obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms in the future is dependent on a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including changes in:\n\u2022\nour credit ratings;\n\u2022\ninterest rates;\n\u2022\nthe structured and commercial financial markets;\n\u2022\nmarket perceptions of us or the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry; and\n\u2022\ntax burden due to new tax laws.\nAssuming a constant debt level of $325.0 million, equal to our borrowing base as of December 7, 2019 under our Credit Agreement, the cash flow impact for a 12-month period resulting from a 100 basis point movement in interest rates, regardless of whether the spread widens or tightens, would be $3.3 million. As a result, any increases in our interest rates, or our inability to access the equity markets on reasonable terms, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. The interest rate on our Senior Notes is fixed.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our Credit Agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on such variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. Assuming a constant debt level under our Credit Agreement of $325.0 million, equal to our borrowing base at December 31, 2019, the cash flow impact for a 12-month period resulting from a 100 basis point change in the variable component of our interest rate would be $3.3 million.\nRisks Related to Legislative and Regulatory Developments\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental and safety regulations, which can adversely affect the cost, manner, and feasibility of doing business.\nOur exploration, production, and marketing operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, tribal, state, and local laws and regulations governing, among other things: land use restrictions, drilling bonds and other financial responsibility requirements, reporting and other requirements with respect to emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants, unitization and pooling of properties, habitat and threatened and endangered species protection, reclamation and remediation, well stimulation processes, produced water disposal, safety precautions, operational reporting, and tax requirements. These laws, regulations and related public policy considerations affect the costs, manner, and feasibility of our operations and require us to make significant expenditures in order to comply. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions that could limit or prohibit our operations. In addition, some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several, strict liability for contamination resulting from spills, discharges, and releases of substances on, under or from our properties and facilities, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. Under such laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed substances and property contamination, including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators. Changes in, or additions to, environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes or additions that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, cleanup or other environmental protection requirements could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nPotential legislative and regulatory actions could negatively affect our business.\nIn addition to the SDWA and other potential regulations on hydraulic fracturing practices, numerous other legislative and regulatory proposals affecting the oil and gas industry have been introduced, are anticipated to be introduced, or are otherwise under consideration, by Congress, state legislatures and various federal and state agencies. Among these proposals are: (1) climate change/carbon tax legislation introduced in Congress, and EPA regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and (2) legislation introduced in Congress to impose new taxes on, or repeal various tax deductions available to, oil and gas producers, such as the current tax deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, which deductions, if eliminated, could raise the cost of energy production, reduce energy investment and affect the economics of oil and gas exploration and production activities. Any of the foregoing described proposals could affect our operations, and the costs thereof. The trend toward stricter standards, increased oversight and regulation and more extensive permit requirements, along with any future laws and regulations, could result in increased costs or additional operating restrictions which could have an effect on demand for oil and natural gas or prices at which it can be sold. However, until such legislation or regulations are enacted or adopted into law and thereafter implemented, it is not possible to gauge their impact on our future operations or their results of operations and financial condition.\nFederal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and waste water injection wells could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nOur hydraulic fracturing operations are a significant component of our business, and it is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly oil and natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, although no rule was ever finalized, in May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Beginning in August 2012, the EPA issued a series of rules under the CAA that establish new emission control requirements for emissions of volatile organic compounds and methane from certain oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations and equipment, and EPA has proposed amendments to these regulations as recently as September 2019. In March 2015 and November 2016, the BLM finalized rules governing hydraulic fracturing and venting and flaring on federal lands. Several of the EPA\u2019s and the BLM\u2019s recently promulgated rules concerning regulation of hydraulic fracturing, including BLM\u2019s hydraulic fracturing and venting and flaring rules, are in various stages of suspension, repeal, implementation delay, and court challenges and, thus, the future of these rules is uncertain. Further, legislation to amend the SDWA to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing (except when diesel fuels are used) from the definition of \u201cunderground injection\u201d and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, have been proposed in Congress from time to time. Several states and local jurisdictions in which we operate also have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, such as requiring certain setback distances from residences or other sensitive areas, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids.\nMore recently, federal and state governments have begun investigating whether the disposal of produced water into underground injection wells (and to a lesser extent, hydraulic fracturing) has caused increased seismic activity in certain areas. In response, some states, including states in which we operate, have imposed additional requirements on the construction and operation of underground disposal wells. For example, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission\u2019s Oil and Gas Conservation Division and the Oklahoma Geologic Survey continue to release well completion seismicity guidance, discussed in more detail below, which most recently directs operators to adopt seismicity response plans and take certain prescriptive actions, including mitigation, following anomalous seismic activity within 3.1 miles of hydraulic fracturing operations.\nThese developments, as well as increased scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing and underground injection activities by state and municipal authorities may result in additional levels of regulation or complexity with respect to existing regulations that could lead to operational delays or cessations or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our cost of compliance and doing business.\nStudies by both state and federal agencies demonstrating a correlation between earthquakes and oil and natural gas activities could result in increased regulatory and operational burdens.\nIn recent years, Oklahoma has experienced a significant increase in earthquakes and other seismic activity. On April 21, 2015, the Oklahoma Geologic Survey (\u201cOGS\u201d) issued a document entitled \u201cStatement of Oklahoma Seismicity,\u201d in which the agency states \u201cthe OGS considers it very likely that the majority of recent earthquakes, particularly those in central and north-central Oklahoma, are triggered by the injection of produced water in disposal wells.\u201d The Oklahoma Corporation Commission (\u201cOCC\u201d) has issued directives restricting injection of high volumes of water into the Arbuckle formation and into the crystalline basement below within a specified area of interest (\u201cAOI\u201d) in Central and Western Oklahoma. The AOI now includes more than 10,000 square miles and more than 600 Arbuckle disposal wells, resulting in a reduction of more than 800,000 barrels per day from the 2015 average injection volumes. The OCC has adopted a \u201ctraffic light\u201d system for disposal operators to review disposal well permits for proximity to faults seismicity in the area and other factors, and adopted rules requiring well pressure recording and reporting, and mechanical integrity tests on certain wells. In addition, the OCC has issued directives aimed at limiting the future growth of disposal rates into the Arbuckle by capping disposal volumes in the AOI, even those not operating under currently permitted volumes, to the thirty day disposal average. We operate 10 wells in the AOI and are fully compliant with all regulations relating to the disposal of produced water, and at this time our operations have not been affected.\nIn February 2018, the Commission introduced new guidelines related to seismicity, requiring operators in the defined area to have access to a seismic array which will provide real-time seismicity readings, and to develop plans to address seismic activity. The guidelines reduce the earthquake magnitude at which action is required from 2.5 to 2.0 within a 3.1 mile radius of hydraulic fracturing operations, and changes the level at which operators are required to pause hydraulic fracturing operations from 3.0 to 2.5.\nWe cannot predict whether future regulatory actions will result in further expansion of AOI or new or additional regulations by the OCC or other agencies with jurisdiction over our operations. Any such new or expanded regulation could result in increased operating costs, cause operational delays, and result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to inject produced water into disposal wells. Increased complexity and reporting requirements arising from expanded regulations may increase our costs of compliance and doing business. In addition, even though we have conducted our operations in compliance with applicable laws, the increase in media and regulatory attention to the possible connection between seismic activity and produced water injection has led to litigation filed against us and other oil and gas producers requesting compensation for damages, including demands for damages caused by earthquakes and earthquake insurance premiums on a going forward basis. We cannot predict the outcome of this litigation or provide assurances that other similar claims will not be filed against us in the future.\nThe adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for natural gas.\nThe EPA has determined that GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because such gases contribute to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has adopted and implemented, and continues to adopt and implement, regulations that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d) under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d). The EPA also requires the annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain large sources of GHG emissions in the United States, including certain oil and gas production facilities and oil and natural gas gathering and boosting operations. The EPA has also taken steps to limit methane emissions from oil and gas production facilities. In addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. And in December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake \u201cambitious efforts\u201d to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016. However, in November 2019,\nthe United States submitted formal notification to the United Nations of its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. The withdrawal will take effect on November 4, 2020. Restrictions on emissions of GHGs that may be imposed could adversely affect the natural gas industry by reducing demand for hydrocarbons and by making it more expensive to develop and produce hydrocarbons, either of which could have a material adverse effect on future demand for our services. Moreover, climate change may cause more extreme weather conditions and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our operations and increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. For a more detailed discussion of climate change, please see Environmental Matters and Regulation - Climate Change.\nWe may face risks associated with the increased activism against oil and gas exploration and development activities.\nOpposition toward oil and gas drilling and development activity has been growing in recent years. Companies in the oil and gas industry are often the target of activist efforts regarding safety, environmental compliance and business practices. Anti-development activists are working to, among other things, reduce access to federal and state government lands and delay or cancel certain projects such as the development of oil or gas shale plays. Future activist efforts could result in the following:\n\u2022\ndelay or denial of drilling permits;\n\u2022\nshortening of lease terms or reduction in lease size;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on installation or operation of production, gathering or processing facilities;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the use of certain operating practices, such as hydraulic fracturing, or the disposal of related waste materials, such as hydraulic fracturing fluids and produced water;\n\u2022\nincreased severance and/or other taxes;\n\u2022\ncyber-attacks;\n\u2022\nlegal challenges or lawsuits;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity about our business or the industry in general;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of doing business; and\n\u2022\nreduction in demand for our products.\nWe may need to incur significant costs associated with responding to these initiatives. Complying with any resulting additional legal or regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.\nEnergy conservation measures or initiatives that stimulate demand for alternative forms of energy could reduce the demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce.\nFuel conservation measures, climate change initiatives, governmental requirements for renewable energy resources, increasing consumer demand for alternative forms of energy, and technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce. The potential impact of changing demand for crude oil and natural gas services and products could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nChanges in U.S. federal or state tax laws and regulations, including the 2017 Tax Act, may have a material adverse effect on our net revenues, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn recent years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. federal and state income tax laws, including the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax benefits and deductions currently available to oil and gas companies. Such changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the increase of the amortization period of geological and geophysical expenses, (iii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; and (iv) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities. Moreover, other generally applicable features of the 2017 Tax Act, such as changes to the deductibility of interest expense, the carryback, carryforward and limitation on the use of post 2017 net operating losses and the cost recovery rules could impact our income taxes and resulting operating cash flow. Additionally, legislation could be enacted that imposes new fees or increases the taxes on oil and natural gas extraction, which could result in increased operating costs and/or reduced consumer demand for petroleum products and thereby affect the prices we receive for our commodity products.\nFuture legislative changes may increase the gross production tax charged on our oil and natural gas production.\nOklahoma imposes a gross production tax, or severance tax, on the value of oil, NGLs and natural gas produced within the state. Under recent changes to Oklahoma law, the gross production tax rate on the first three years of a horizontal well\u2019s production was increased from 2% to 5%, effective July 1, 2018. As a result, production from new Oklahoma wells are now taxed at a 5% rate for the first 36 months of production and at 7% thereafter. The passage of any further legislation or ballot initiatives that would increase\nthe tax burden on all of our oil and gas production occurring in the State of Oklahoma would negatively affect our net revenues, our financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) may be limited as a result of our emergence from bankruptcy and new limitations under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d).\nIn general, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) of 1986, as amended, provides an annual limitation with respect to the ability of a corporation to utilize its tax attributes, as well as certain built-in-losses, against future taxable income in the event of a change in ownership. Our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings resulted in a change in ownership for purposes of the IRC Section 382. The Company analyzed alternatives available within the IRC to taxpayers in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in order to minimize the impact of the ownership change and cancellation of indebtedness income on its tax attributes. Upon filing its 2017 U.S. Federal income tax return, the Company elected an available alternative which would likely result in the Company experiencing a limitation that subjects existing tax attributes at emergence to an IRC Section 382 limitation that could result in some or all of the remaining net operating loss carryforwards expiring unused. Upon final determination of tax return amounts for the year ended December 31, 2017, including attribute reduction that occurred on January 1, 2018, the Company had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of $1.01 billion including $760.1 million which are subject to limitation due to the ownership change that occurred upon emergence from bankruptcy and $251.3 million of post-change net operating loss carryforwards not subject to this limitation. Because of the limitations that apply to these NOL amounts, it is possible that some portion of the Company\u2019s NOLs could expire unused.\nIn addition to the above, there are new limitations that apply to NOLs that arise in a taxable year ending after December 31, 2017. Unlike the law in effect prior to the 2017 Tax Act, the amendments to Section 172 disallow the carryback of NOLs but allow for the indefinite carryforward of those NOLs. In addition to the carryover and carryback changes, the 2017 Tax Act also introduces a limitation on the amount of post-2017 NOLs that a corporation may deduct in a single tax year under section 172(a) equal to the lesser of the available NOL carryover or 80 percent of a taxpayer\u2019s pre-NOL deduction taxable income.\nLimitations imposed on our ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income may cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.\nThe implementation of derivatives legislation adopted by the U.S. Congress could have an adverse effect on us and our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market including swap clearing and trade execution requirements. New or modified rules, regulations or requirements may increase the cost and availability to the counterparties of our hedging and swap positions which they can make available to us, as applicable, and may further require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivative activities to separate entities which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties. Any changes in the regulations of swaps may result in certain market participants deciding to curtail or cease their derivative activities.\nWhile many rules and regulations have been promulgated and are already in effect, other rules and regulations remain to be finalized or effectuated, and therefore, the impact of those rules and regulations on us is uncertain at this time. The Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder, could (i) significantly increase the cost, or decrease the liquidity, of energy-related derivatives that we use to hedge against commodity price fluctuations (including through requirements to post collateral), (ii) materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, (iii) reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, and (iv) increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nA change in the jurisdictional characterization of our assets, or a change in policy, could result in increased regulation of our assets which could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our pipeline assets are natural gas gathering facilities. Unlike interstate natural gas transportation facilities, natural gas gathering facilities are exempt from the jurisdiction of FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (\u201cNGA\u201d). Although FERC has not made a formal determination with respect to all of our facilities we believe to be gathering facilities, we believe that these pipelines meet the traditional tests that FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and is therefore not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress. If FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services\nprovided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA and that the facility provides interstate service, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by FERC under the NGA or the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (\u201cNGPA\u201d). Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or NGPA, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such services in excess of the rate established by FERC.\nIncreased regulatory requirements regarding pipeline safety and integrity management may require us to incur significant capital and operating expenses to comply.\nThe ultimate costs of compliance with pipeline safety and integrity management regulations are difficult to predict. The majority of the compliance costs are for pipeline safety and integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary. We plan to continue our efforts to assess and maintain the safety and integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by the DOT and PHMSA rules. The results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines. In addition, new laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future, or a revised interpretation of existing laws and regulations, could significantly increase the amount of these costs. We cannot be assured about the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs, or additional operating restrictions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock and the price at which we may sell common stock in the future are subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nlimited trading volume in our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe concentration of holdings of our common stock;\n\u2022\nvariations in operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in production levels;\n\u2022\nour involvement in litigation;\n\u2022\ngeneral U.S. or worldwide financial market conditions;\n\u2022\nconditions impacting the prices of oil and gas;\n\u2022\nour liquidity and access to capital;\n\u2022\nour ability to raise additional funds;\n\u2022\nevents impacting the energy industry;\n\u2022\nlack of trading market;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations; and\n\u2022\nother events.\nThe stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price.\nTrading of our common stock in the public market has been limited. Therefore, the holders of our common stock may be unable to liquidate their investment in our common stock.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, our old common stock was canceled and we issued new common stock. From May 18, 2017, through May 25, 2017, our Class A common stock was quoted on the OTC Pink marketplace under the symbol \u201cCHHP\u201d. From May 26, 2017, through July 23, 2018, our Class A common stock was quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets Group Inc. under the symbol \u201cCHPE\u201d. On July 24, 2018, we transferred our stock exchange listing for our Class A common stock from the OTCQB market to the New York Stock Exchange and began trading under the new ticker symbol \u201cCHAP.\u201d On December 19, 2018, all outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, converted into the same number of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the terms of our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d).\nAlthough our common stock is listed on a U.S. national securities exchange, no assurance can be given that an active market will develop for our Class A common stock or as to the liquidity of the trading market for the common stock.\nHolders of our common stock may experience difficulty in reselling, or an inability to sell, their shares. In addition, if an active trading market does not develop or is not maintained, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, investors in our securities may not be able to resell their shares at or above the purchase price paid by them or may not be able to resell them at all.\nWe may not be able to maintain our listing on the NYSE, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.\nOur common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d). There are a number of continued listing requirements that we must satisfy in order to maintain our listing on the NYSE. If we fail to maintain compliance with all applicable continued listing requirements and the NYSE determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock, our ability to obtain financing and our ability to fund our operations.\nThe NYSE\u2019s standards for continued listing include, among other things, that the average closing price of a security as reported on the NYSE consolidated tape be $1.00 or greater over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. On February 28, 2020, we were notified by the NYSE that, for the last 30 trading days, the closing price for our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement. In accordance with the NYSE\u2019s listed company manual rules, we have been provided a period of six months, or until August 28, 2020 (the \u201cCompliance Date\u201d), to regain compliance with the closing price requirement.\nIf, at any time before the Compliance Date, we have a closing share price of at least $1.00 on the last trading day of any calendar month and an average closing share price of at least $1.00 over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of that month, then we would regain compliance with the closing price requirement. One action we may consider in order to regain compliance prior to the Compliance Date would be to implement a reverse stock split.\nIf we do not regain compliance with the closing price requirement by the Compliance Date, and are not eligible for an additional compliance period at that time, the NYSE\u2019s staff will provide written notification to us that our common stock may be delisted. At that time, we may appeal the NYSE\u2019s staff\u2019s delisting determination to a committee of the NYSE\u2019s board of directors. Any such delisting could result in our stock becoming ineligible to be included in one or more or held in or by one or more funds and otherwise adversely affect the market liquidity of our common shares, and, accordingly, the market price of our common shares could decrease. A delisting could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for our operations or result in a loss of confidence by investors, customers, suppliers or employees.\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders may not align with the interests of our other stockholders, and concentrated share ownership may affect the market for the Company\u2019s Class A common shares.\nOn December 20, 2019, as a result of the Company and SVP entering into the Amended SVP Agreement: (i) the authorized number of directors on the Board was increased from seven to eight, (ii) K. Earl Reynolds resigned from his positions as Chief Executive Officer, president and a director of the Company and Charles Duginski was appointed CEO, president and director of the Company and (iii) two SVP designees were appointed to the Board. As a result, the Board now consists of eight directors, two of which are SVP designees.\nWhile the SVP designees\u2019 fiduciary duties are to all Company stockholders, nothing obliges SVP, as a stockholder, to support initiatives that are supported by the Board as a whole. Likewise, nothing prevents SVP from pursuing transactions or financial arrangements that are in its, but not the Company\u2019s or the Company\u2019s other stockholders\u2019, best interests. Furthermore, our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common shares because of decreased liquidity in the market for the shares or the potential perception by others in the investing community of disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant stockholders.", "PERMNO": 17981, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CHAPQ"}
