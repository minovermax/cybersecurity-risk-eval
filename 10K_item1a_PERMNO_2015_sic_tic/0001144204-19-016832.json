{"cik": "895051", "company": "CASI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Relating to our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nTo date, we have been engaged primarily in research and development activities. Although in the past we have received limited revenues on royalties from the sales of pharmaceuticals, license fees and research and development funding from a former collaborator and limited revenues from certain research grants, we have not derived significant revenues from operations.\nWe have experienced losses in each year since inception. Through December 31, 2018 we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $478.9 million. We expect that we will seek to raise capital to continue our operations and although we have been successfully funded to date through the sales of our equity securities and through limited royalty payments, our capital-raising efforts may not produce the funding needed to sustain our operations. If we are unable to obtain additional funding for operations, we may not be able to continue operations as proposed, requiring us to modify our business plan, curtail various aspects of our operations or cease operations. In any such event, investors may lose a portion or all of their investment.\nWe expect that our ongoing clinical and corporate activities will result in operating losses for the foreseeable future. In addition, to the extent we rely on others to develop and commercialize our products, our ability to achieve profitability will depend upon the success of these other parties. To support our research and development of certain product candidates, we may seek and rely on cooperative agreements from governmental and other organizations as a source of support. If a cooperative agreement were to be reduced to any substantial extent, it may impair our ability to continue our research and development efforts. To become and remain profitable, we must successfully commercialize one or more product candidates with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing clinical trials of our product candidates, developing commercial scale manufacturing processes, obtaining marketing approval, manufacturing, marketing and selling any current and future product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval, and satisfying any post-marketing requirements. We may never succeed in any or all of these activities and, even if we do, we may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability.\nOur common stock could be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, which could affect our common stock\u2019s market price and liquidity.\nOur listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market is contingent upon meeting all the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market. In the past, we have received written notices from Nasdaq for failing to maintain a minimum bid price of not less than $1.00 per share and a minimum of $2.5 million in stockholders\u2019 equity. Although we have regained compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing standards, there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance in the future.\nIf our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited. Delisting could also result in less liquidity for our stockholders and a lower stock price.\nWe may engage in strategic and other corporate transactions, which could negatively affect our financial condition and prospects.\nWe may consider strategic and other corporate transactions as opportunities present themselves. There are risks associated with such activities. These risks include, among others, incorrectly assessing the quality of a prospective strategic partner, encountering greater than anticipated costs in integration, being unable to profitably deploy assets acquired in the transaction, such as drug candidates, possible dilution to our stockholders, and the loss of key employees due to changes in management. Further, strategic transactions may place additional constraints on our resources by diverting the attention of our management from our business operations. To the extent we issue securities in connection with additional transactions, these transactions and related issuances may have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders. Our financial condition and prospects after an acquisition depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business or technologies. We may be unable to integrate operations successfully or to achieve expected cost savings. Any cost savings which are realized may be offset by losses in revenues or other charges to earnings.\nThe current capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect our access to capital, cost of capital, and ability to execute our business plan as scheduled.\nAccess to capital markets is critical to our ability to operate. Traditionally, biopharmaceutical companies have funded their research and development expenditures through raising capital in the equity markets. Declines and uncertainties in these markets over the past few years have restricted raising new capital in amounts sufficient to conduct our current operations and have affected our ability to continue to expand or fund research and development efforts with our product candidates. We require significant capital for research and development for our product candidates and clinical trials. In recent years, the general economic and capital market conditions in the United States have deteriorated significantly and have adversely affected our access to capital and increased the cost of capital, and there is no certainty that a recovery in the capital and credit markets, enabling us to raise capital in an amount to sufficiently fund our short-term and long-term plans, will occur in 2018. If these economic conditions continue or become worse, our future cost of equity or debt capital and access to the capital markets could be adversely affected. In addition, our inability to access the capital markets on favorable terms because of our low stock price, or upon our delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market if we fail to satisfy a listing requirement, could affect our ability to execute our business plan as scheduled. Moreover, we rely and intend to rely on third parties, including our clinical research organizations, third party manufacturers, and certain other important vendors and consultants. As a result of the current volatile and unpredictable global economic situation, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third-party contractors and suppliers. If such third parties are unable to adequately satisfy their contractual commitments to us in a timely manner, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe do not have any active revenue streams and we are uncertain whether additional funding will be available for our future capital needs and commitments. If we cannot raise additional funding, or access the capital markets, we may be unable to complete the development of our product candidates.\nWe will require substantial funds in addition to our existing working capital to develop our product candidates and otherwise to meet our business objectives. We have never generated sufficient revenue during any period since our inception to cover our expenses and have spent, and expect to continue to spend, substantial funds to continue our clinical development programs. Any one of the following factors, among others, could cause us to require additional funds or otherwise cause our cash requirements in the future to increase materially:\n\u00b7 progress of our clinical trials or correlative studies;\n\u00b7 results of clinical trials;\n\u00b7 changes in or terminations of our relationships with strategic partners;\n\u00b7 changes in the focus, direction, or costs of our research and development programs;\n\u00b7 competitive and technological advances;\n\u00b7 establishment of marketing and sales capabilities;\n\u00b7 manufacturing;\n\u00b7 the regulatory approval process; or\n\u00b7 product launch.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $84.2 million. We may continue to seek additional capital through public or private financing or collaborative agreements in 2019 and beyond. Our operations require significant amounts of cash. We may be required to seek additional capital for the future growth and development of our business. We can give no assurance as to the availability of such additional capital or, if available, whether it would be on terms acceptable to us. If we are not successful in obtaining sufficient capital because we are unable to access the capital markets on favorable terms, it could reduce our research and development efforts and materially adversely affect our future growth, results of operations and financial results.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion and payments of RMB out of mainland China may limit our ability to utilize our cash balances effectively and affect the value of your investment.\nOur China subsidiary has assets that include approximately 106.1 million China Renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d), valued at approximately $15.4 million in U.S. dollars. On a consolidated basis this balance accounts for approximately 18% of our total cash and cash equivalents. The Chinese government imposes controls on the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of RMB out of mainland China. Control on payments out of mainland China may restrict the ability of our China subsidiary to remit RMB to us. Approval from China\u2019s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d) and the People\u2019s Bank of China (\u201cPBOC\u201d) may be required where RMB are to be converted into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, and approval from SAFE and the PBOC or their branches may be required where RMB are to be remitted out of mainland China. Specifically, under the existing restrictions, without a prior approval from SAFE and the PBOC, the cash balance of our China subsidiary is not available to us for activities outside of China including support of our in-licensing efforts. Furthermore, because repatriation of funds requires the prior approval of SAFE and PBOC, such repatriation could be delayed, restricted or limited.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe regulatory approval process of the regulatory authorities in the United States and China are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable. If we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval by FDA and NMPA is unpredictable and typically takes many years following the commencement of preclinical studies and clinical trials and depends on numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities.\nOur drug candidates could be delayed or fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7 failure to begin or complete clinical trials due to disagreements with regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7 failure to demonstrate that a drug candidate is safe and effective or that a biologic candidate is safe, pure, and potent for its proposed indication;\n\u00b7 failure of clinical trial results to meet the level of statistical significance required for approval;\n\u00b7 reporting or data integrity issues related to our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 disagreement with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7 changes in approval policies or regulations that render our preclinical and clinical data insufficient for approval or require us to amend our clinical trial protocols;\n\u00b7 regulatory requests for additional analyses, reports, data, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, or questions regarding interpretations of data and results and the emergence of new information regarding our drug candidates or other products;\n\u00b7 failure to satisfy regulatory conditions regarding endpoints, patient population, available therapies and other requirements for our clinical trials in order to support marketing approval on an accelerated basis or at all;\n\u00b7 our failure to conduct a clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical trial protocols; and\n\u00b7 clinical sites, investigators or other participants in our clinical trials deviating from a trial protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, or dropping out of a trial.\nThe FDA, NMPA or a comparable regulatory authority may require more information, including additional preclinical, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and/or clinical data, to support approval, which may delay or prevent approval and our commercialization plans, or we may decide to abandon the development program.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance may also occur, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols submitted to applicable regulatory authorities to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit clinical trial protocols to IRBs or ethics committees for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of, or the termination of, a clinical trial of any of our drug candidates, the commercial prospects of that drug candidate may be harmed, and our ability to generate product sales revenues from any of those drug candidates may be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our drug candidate development and approval process, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate related revenues for that candidate. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our drug candidates.\nThe recent restructure of the Chinese drug regulatory authorities may delay approval of our products or drug candidates in China.\nOn March 17, 2018, China\u2019s highest legislative body, the National People\u2019s Congress, approved a sweeping government restructuring plan. This is generally considered to be the most comprehensive government restructuring that China has undertaken since its \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy in the late 1970s. As part of the new plan, China has established a SAMR, which merges and undertakes the responsibilities previously held by the China Food and Drug Administration, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ), the Certification and Accreditation Administration (CAC), and the Standardization Administration of China (SAC). The central government expects to complete the restructuring at the state level by the end of 2018. Municipal and county level authorities must complete the restructure by the first quarter of 2019.\nThe new NMPA reports to the SAMR, is responsible for the review and approval of drugs, medical devices and cosmetics, and maintains its own branches at the provincial level and leave the post-approval enforcement authorities at the local level to the consolidated SAMR branches.\nAlthough the NMPA is fully functional as of 2018, the reorganization will continue at the provincial and local levels through the first quarter of 2019. This massive restructuring exercise could result in the delay of key decision-making in various sectors, including the pharmaceutical and medical device industry. In addition, there could be delays in the NMPA\u2019s implementation of the new reform initiatives and disruption in the NMPA\u2019s routine operations due to personnel reshuffle.\nWe may not be able to commercialize our drugs or drug candidates in China without obtaining regulatory approval from NMPA.\nWe have exclusive licenses to develop and commercialize Melphalan Hydrochloride For Injection (EVOMELA), ibritumomab tiuxetan (ZEVALIN) and vinCRIStine sulfate LIPOSOME injection (MARQIBO in Greater China. On December 3, 2018, we received NMPA\u2019s approval for importation, marketing and sales in China for Melphalan Hydrochloride for Injection (EVOMELA). In addition, we acquired a portfolio of 25 U.S. FDA-approved ANDAs, four ANDAs that are pending FDA approval, and one ANDA for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) indicated for hepatitis B virus. An ANDA contains data that is submitted to FDA for the review and potential approval of a generic drug product. Once approved, the applicant may manufacture and market the generic drug product to provide a safe, effective, lower cost alternative to the brand-name drug it references. We intend to select and pursue commercialization of certain products from our ANDA portfolio that offer unique market and cost-effective manufacturing opportunities in China and/or in the U.S. However, the majority of our drug candidates are still in clinical or pre-clinical development in China.\nOur success in commercializing these drugs may be inhibited by a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 our inability to obtain/maintain regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u00b7 the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or educate physicians on the benefits of our products;\n\u00b7 our lack of experience in manufacturing drugs for commercial sales;\n\u00b7 our or our partners\u2019 inability to secure widespread acceptance of our products from physicians, healthcare payors, patients and the medical community;\n\u00b7 our ability to win tenders through the collective tender processes in which we decide to participate;\n\u00b7 the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u00b7 unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we decide to rely on third parties to manufacture, sell, market and distribute our products and product candidates, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with such third parties or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, our product revenues and our profitability, if any, may be lower if we rely on third parties for these functions than if we were to market, sell and distribute any products that we develop ourselves. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates, which would adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe commercial success of Melphalan Hydrochloride for Injection (EVOMELA) in China may be slow or limited for a variety of reasons.\nOn December 3, 2018, we received NMPA\u2019s approval for importation, marketing and sales in China for Melphalan Hydrochloride For Injection (EVOMELA). We will spend our time, resources and effort on the commercialization of our approved drug in China in the near future. However, there are no guarantees that we will be successfully commercialize the medicine in China.\nReimbursement and hospital listing may be the most critical market access factors for our commercialization success in China. There is no regular update schedule for the NRDL. The government has committed to updating the NRDL in 2019. Given that Melphalan Hydrochloride For Injection (EVOMELA) was approved in 2018, we may or may not qualify for the next NDRL update should it be implemented in 2019. Provincial governments have some discretion to add Melphalan Hydrochloride For Injection (EVOMELA) to provincial reimbursement drug lists. With or without being listed on the NRDL, we can apply for inclusion in the provincial reimbursement drug lists of selected provinces. Until Melphalan Hydrochloride For Injection (EVOMELA) is listed in the NRDL or the majority of provincial reimbursement drug lists, our market will be extremely limited given only a small portion of the Chinese population would be able to afford our drug through self-pay.\nEven when Melphalan Hydrochloride For Injection (EVOMELA) has been included in a government hospital formulary, the NDRL or the provincial reimbursement drug list, we need to win tenders during the collective tender process in order to supply the drug to state-owned or state-controlled hospitals. If we are unable to win purchase contracts through the collective tender processes in which we decide to participate, there will be limited demand for Melphalan Hydrochloride For Injection (EVOMELA), and sales revenues from the drug will be materially and adversely affected. Last but not least, we need to ensure that Melphalan Hydrochloride For Injection (EVOMELA) has been quickly added to hospitals\u2019 formulary. If we were unable to quickly add Melphalan Hydrochloride For Injection (EVOMELA) to hospitals\u2019 formulary, doctors and patients will not have access to our drug through hospital pharmacies.\nWe conduct development and operations in China, which exposes us to risks associated with operating outside of the United States. Changes in international trade and economic policy by the U.S. and Chinese governments could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe have operations and conduct business in China and we plan to continue to expand these operations. Therefore, we are subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries, which include unfamiliar foreign laws or regulatory requirements or unexpected changes to those laws or requirements; other laws and regulatory requirements to which our business activities abroad are subject, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; changes in the political or economic condition of a specific country or region; fluctuations in the value of foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar; our ability to deploy overseas funds in an efficient manner; tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes, and sanctions (including those administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury), and other trade barriers; difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel; and cultural differences in the conduct of business. There is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.S. and various other countries, including China, with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. The Trump Administration has called for substantial changes to U.S. foreign trade policy, including the possibility of imposing greater restrictions on international trade and significant increases in tariffs. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current political climate could adversely impact our business.\nWe are establishing a joint venture to build and operate a manufacturing facility in the Wuxi Huishan Economic Development Zone. The success of this joint venture is subject to uncertainty and may reduce our earnings, be difficult to accomplish, take longer than expected or require us to obtain additional financing.\nWe have invested approximately $21 million and intend to invest a total of approximately $80 million, of which $30 million is intended to be an investment in the value of certain ANDA products to be determined and transferred to the joint venture, proceeds to be used in the building and operating a manufacturing facility in the Wuxi Huishan Economic Development Zone in Jiangsu Province, China. The Company\u2019s total investment is intended to account for 80% of the equity of the joint venture. This joint venture may not achieve the expected goal as the planned manufacturing facility will not be entirely within our control. It can take years to build and establish a new manufacturing facility. Once built, the new facility might fail validation or not meet regulatory standards for a commercial manufacturing facility. In addition, we may not obtain or retain the requisite legal permits to manufacture in China, and costs or operational limitations may be imposed in connection with obtaining and complying with such permits. Our ability to establish and operate a manufacturing facility in China may be adversely affected by changes in Chinese laws and regulations such as those related to, among other things, taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, intellectual property, employee benefits and other matters. The success of this joint venture also relies on our ability to make additional payments in the future, which is uncertain. Our plan may require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional debt obligations, increased interest expense or dilution of equity ownership. If we are unable to establish a new manufacturing facility, purchase equipment, hire adequate personnel to support our manufacturing efforts or implement necessary process improvements, we may be unable to produce commercial materials or meet demand, if any should develop, for our product candidates. Any one of the factors cited above, or a combination of them, could result in unanticipated costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business and planned operations and development in China.\nThe retail prices of any product candidates that we develop may be subject to control, including periodic downward adjustment, by Chinese government authorities.\nThe price for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated in China, both at the national and provincial level. Price controls may reduce prices to levels significantly below those that would prevail in less regulated markets, or limit the volume of products that may be sold, either of which may have a material and adverse effect on potential revenues from sales of our drug products in China. Moreover, the process and timing for the implementation of price restrictions is unpredictable, which may cause potential revenues from the sales of our drug product to fluctuate from period to period.\nThe existence of counterfeit pharmaceutical products in pharmaceutical markets may compromise our brand and reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and prospects.\nCounterfeit products, including counterfeit pharmaceutical products, are a significant problem, particularly in China. Counterfeit pharmaceuticals are products sold or used for research under the same or similar names, or similar mechanism of action or product class, but which are sold without proper licenses or approvals. Such products may be used for indications or purposes that are not recommended or approved or for which there is no data or inadequate data with regard to safety or efficacy. Such products divert sales from genuine products, often are of lower cost, often are of lower quality (having different ingredients or formulations, for example), and have the potential to damage the reputation for quality and effectiveness of the genuine product. If counterfeit pharmaceuticals illegally sold or used for research result in adverse events or side effects to consumers, we may be associated with any negative publicity resulting from such incidents. Consumers may buy counterfeit pharmaceuticals that are in direct competition with our pharmaceuticals, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues, business and results of operations. In addition, the use of counterfeit products could be used in non-clinical or clinical studies, or could otherwise produce undesirable side effects or adverse events that may be attributed to our products as well, which could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities and potential product liability claims. With respect to China, although the government has recently been increasingly active in policing counterfeit pharmaceuticals, there is not yet an effective counterfeit pharmaceutical regulation control and enforcement system in China. As a result, we may not be able to prevent third parties from selling or purporting to sell our products in China. The proliferation of counterfeit pharmaceuticals has grown in recent years and may continue to grow in the future. The existence of and any increase in the sales and production of counterfeit pharmaceuticals, or the technological capabilities of counterfeiters, could negatively impact our revenues, brand reputation, business and results of operations.\nUncertainties with respect to the China legal system could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe legal system of China is a civil law system primarily based on written statutes. Unlike in a common law system, prior court decisions may be cited for reference but are not binding. Because the China legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to us. Moreover, decision makers in the China judicial system have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, which may render it difficult for us to enforce the contracts entered into with our business partners, customers and suppliers. Different government departments may have different interpretations of certain laws and regulations, and licenses and permits issued or granted by one government authority may be revoked by a higher government authority at a later time. Navigating the uncertainty and change in the China legal system will require the devotion of significant resources and time, and there can be no assurance that our contractual and other rights will ultimately be enforced.\nChanges in China\u2019s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nChinese society and the Chinese economy continue to undergo significant change. Adverse changes in the political and economic policies of the Chinese government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct business in China. The Chinese government continues to adjust economic policies to promote economic growth. Some of these measures benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may also have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations in China may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. As the Chinese pharmaceutical industry grows and evolves, the Chinese government may also implement measures to change the structure of foreign investment in this industry. We are unable to predict the frequency and scope of such policy changes, any of which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, access to capital and its ability to conduct business in China. Any failure on our part to comply with changing government regulations and policies could result in the loss of our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates in China.\nWe are currently building our sales and distribution infrastructure. If we are unable to develop our sales, marketing and distribution capability on our own or through collaborations with marketing partners, we will not be successful in commercializing Melphalan Hydrochloride For Injection (EVOMELA) or any other product candidates.\nIn December of 2018, we received NMPA\u2019s approval for importation, marketing and sales in China for Melphalan Hydrochloride For Injection (EVOMELA). We are in the process of establishing a sales and marketing team with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to successfully commercialize EVOMELA, or to outsource this function to a third party. Both of these options can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, we may not be able to hire a sales force in the China that is large enough or has adequate expertise in the medical markets that we intend to target. Any failure or delay in the development of our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of Melphalan Hydrochloride For Injection (EVOMELA) and other product candidates.\nWe have limited experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we must either develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to third parties. We will need to commit significant time and financial and managerial resources to maintain and further develop our marketing and sales force to ensure they have the technical expertise required to address any challenges we may face with the commercialization of Melphalan Hydrochloride For Injection (EVOMELA).\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to maintain and develop our commercialization capabilities include:\n\u00b7 our ability to retain an adequate number of effective commercial personnel in the medical markets we intend to target\u037e\n\u00b7 our ability to train sales personnel, who may have limited experience with our company or Melphalan Hydrochloride For Injection (EVOMELA), to deliver a consistent message regarding the medicine and be effective in convincing physicians to prescribe it;\n\u00b7 a lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines;\n\u00b7 unforeseen costs and expenses associated with maintaining and further developing an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we are not successful in establishing and maintaining an effective sales and marketing infrastructure, we will have difficulty commercializing Melphalan Hydrochloride For Injection (EVOMELA) and our future product revenue will suffer, which would adversely affect our business and financial condition. If we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, our product revenues or the profitability of these product revenues to us are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we are not successful in commercializing any approved products, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer, and we may incur significant additional losses.\nWe may need new collaborative partners to further develop and commercialize products, and if we enter into such arrangements, we may lose control over the development and approval process.\nWe plan to develop and commercialize our product candidates both with and without corporate alliances and partners. Nonetheless, we intend to explore opportunities for new corporate alliances and partners to help us develop, commercialize and market our product candidates. We expect to grant to our partners certain rights to commercialize any products developed under these agreements, and we may rely on our partners to conduct research and development efforts and clinical trials on, obtain regulatory approvals for, and manufacture and market any products licensed to them. Each individual partner will seek to control the amount and timing of resources devoted to these activities generally. We anticipate obtaining revenues from our strategic partners under such relationships in the form of research and development payments and payments upon achievement of certain milestones. Since we generally expect to obtain a royalty for sales or a percentage of profits of products licensed to third parties, our revenues may be less than if we retained all commercialization rights and marketed products directly. In addition, there is a risk that our corporate partners will pursue alternative technologies or develop competitive products as a means for developing treatments for the diseases targeted by our programs.\nWe may not be successful in establishing any collaborative arrangements. Even if we do establish such collaborations, we may not successfully commercialize any products under or derive any revenues from these arrangements. There is a risk that we will be unable to manage simultaneous collaborations, if any, successfully. With respect to existing and potential future strategic alliances and collaborative arrangements, we will depend on the expertise and dedication of sufficient resources by these outside parties to develop, manufacture, or market products. If a strategic alliance or collaborative partner fails to develop or commercialize a product to which it has rights, we may not recognize any revenues on that particular product.\nWe may not be able to successfully identify and acquire new product candidates.\nOur growth strategy relies on our in-license of new product candidates from third parties. Our pipeline will be dependent upon the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions. Even if such opportunities are present, we may not be able to successfully identify appropriate acquisition candidates. Moreover, other companies, many of which may have substantially greater financial resources are competing with us for the right to acquire such product candidates.\nIf a product candidate is identified, the third parties with whom we seek to cooperate may not select us as a potential partner or we may not be able to enter into arrangements on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Furthermore, the negotiation and completion of collaborative and license arrangements could cause significant diversion of management\u2019s time and resources and potential disruption of our ongoing business.\nWe face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and our business will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nIf competitors were to develop superior drug candidates, our products could be rendered noncompetitive or obsolete, resulting in a material adverse effect to our business. Developments in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are expected to continue at a rapid pace. Success depends upon achieving and maintaining a competitive position in the development of products and technologies. Competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies can be intense. Many competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities, marketing, financial and managerial resources and experience in the industry.\nIn the generic products market, we face competition from other generic pharmaceutical companies, which may impact our selling price and revenues from such products. The FDA approval process often results in the FDA granting final approval to a number of ANDAs for a given product at the time a patent for a corresponding brand product or other market exclusivity expires. This may force us to face immediate competition when we seek to introduce a generic product into the market. If competition from other generic pharmaceutical companies intensifies, revenues may decline.\nThe availability of our competitors\u2019 products could limit the demand, and the price we are able to charge, for product candidate we develop. We will not achieve our business plan if the acceptance of our products is inhibited by price competition or reimbursement issues or if physicians switch to other new drug products or choose to reserve our product candidates for use in limited circumstances. The inability to compete with existing or subsequently introduced drug products would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe must show the safety and efficacy of our product candidates through clinical trials, the results of which are uncertain.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our products, we must demonstrate, through preclinical studies (animal testing) and clinical trials (human testing), that our proposed products are safe and effective for use in each target indication. Testing of our product candidates will be required, and failure can occur at any stage of testing. Clinical trials may not demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain the required regulatory approvals or result in marketable products. The failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product under development could delay or prevent regulatory approval of the potential product.\nClinical trials for the product candidates we are developing may be delayed by many factors, including that potential patients for testing are limited in number. The failure of any clinical trials to meet applicable regulatory standards could cause such trials to be delayed or terminated, which could further delay the commercialization of any of our product candidates. Newly emerging safety risks observed in animal or human studies also can result in delays of ongoing or proposed clinical trials. Any such delays will increase our product development costs. If such delays are significant, they could negatively affect our financial results and the commercial prospects for our products.\nCompliance with ongoing post-marketing obligations for our approved ANDAs or NDAs may uncover new safety information that could give rise to a product recall, updated warnings, or other regulatory actions that could have an adverse impact on our business.\nAfter the FDA approves a drug for marketing under an NDA or ANDA, the product\u2019s sponsor must comply with several post-marketing obligations that continue until the product is discontinued. These post-marking obligations include the prompt reporting of serious adverse events to the agency, the submission of product-specific annual reports that include changes in the distribution, manufacturing, and labeling information, and notification when a drug product is found to have significant deviations from its approved manufacturing specifications (among others). Our ongoing compliance with these types of mandatory reporting requirements could result in additional requests for information from the FDA and, depending on the scope of a potential product issue that the FDA may decide to pursue, potentially also result in a request from the agency to conduct a product recall or to strengthen warnings and/or revise other label information about the product. Any of these post-marketing regulatory actions could materially affect our sales and, therefore, they have the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on patents and other proprietary rights, some of which are uncertain.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patents for our products in the United States, China and elsewhere. The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in general is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Risks that relate to patenting our products include the following:\n\u00b7 our failure to obtain additional patents;\n\u00b7 challenge, invalidation, or circumvention of patents already issued to us;\n\u00b7 failure of the rights granted under our patents to provide sufficient protection;\n\u00b7 independent development of similar products by third parties; or\n\u00b7 ability of third parties to design around patents issued to our collaborators or us.\nOur potential products may conflict with composition, method, and use of patents that have been or may be granted to competitors, universities or others. As the biotechnology industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our potential products may give rise to claims that may infringe the patents of others. Such other persons could bring legal actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing of the affected products. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of effort by our management and technical personnel. If any of these actions are successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products. We may not prevail in any action and any license required under any needed patent might not be made available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect and others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques and gain access to our trade secrets and disclose our technology. We may be unable to meaningfully protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets. We require our employees to complete confidentiality training that specifically addresses trade secrets. All employees, consultants, and advisors are required to execute a confidentiality agreement when beginning an employment or a consulting relationship with us. The agreements generally provide that all trade secrets and inventions conceived by the individual and all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the term of the relationship automatically become our exclusive property. Employees and consultants must keep such information confidential and may not disclose such information to third parties except in specified circumstances. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.\nTo the extent that consultants, key employees, or other third parties apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to our proposed projects, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to such information. Any such disputes may not be resolved in our favor. Certain of our consultants are employed by or have consulting agreements with other companies and any inventions discovered by them generally will not become our property.\nPotential products may subject us to product liability for which insurance may not be available.\nThe use of our potential products in clinical trials and the marketing of any pharmaceutical products may expose us to product liability claims. We have obtained a level of liability insurance coverage that we believe is adequate in scope and coverage for our current stage of development. However, our present insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities we might incur. In addition, our existing coverage will not be adequate as we further develop products and, in the future, adequate insurance coverage and indemnification by collaborative partners may not be available in sufficient amounts or at a reasonable cost. If a product liability claim or series of claims are brought against us for uninsured liabilities, or in excess of our insurance coverage, the payment of such liabilities could have a negative effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe are subject to certain U.S. healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement; our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to certain U.S. healthcare laws and regulations and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation:\n\u00b7 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS), which governs our business activities, including our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities. The AKS prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Remuneration is not defined in the AKS and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, coupons, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. This statute has been broadly interpreted to apply to manufacturer arrangements with prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others;\n\u00b7 the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its regulations which prohibit, among other things, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food, drug, device, or cosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded;\n\u00b7 federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u00b7 federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7 the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, which impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7 state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts;\n\u00b7 the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a U.S. law which regulates certain financial relationships with foreign government officials (which could include, for example, certain medical professionals);\n\u00b7 federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;\n\u00b7 federal and state government price reporting laws that require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on our marketed drugs (participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements may subject us to potentially significant discounts on our products, increased infrastructure costs, and could potentially affect our ability to offer certain marketplace discounts); and\n\u00b7 federal and state financial transparency laws, which generally require certain types of expenditures in the United States to be tracked and reported (compliance with such requirements may require investment in infrastructure to ensure that tracking is performed properly, and some of these laws result in the public disclosure of various types of payments and relationships with healthcare providers and healthcare entities, which could potentially have a negative effect on our business and/or increase enforcement scrutiny of our activities).\nIn addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate certain federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, FDA rule and regulations, as well as false claims laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we, or our officers or employees, may be subject to penalties, including administrative civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, withdrawal of regulatory approval, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to sell our products or operate our business and also adversely affect our financial results.\nIf we are unable to obtain both adequate coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers for our products, our revenues and prospects for profitability will suffer.\nSuccessful commercialization of our products is highly dependent on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement is, and will be, available from third-party payers, including governmental payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurers. Patients may not be capable of paying for our products themselves and may rely on third-party payers to pay for, or subsidize, the costs of their medications, among other medical costs. If third-party payers do not provide coverage or reimbursement for our products, our revenues and prospects for profitability will suffer. In addition, even if third-party payers provide some coverage or reimbursement for our products, the availability of such coverage or reimbursement for prescription drugs under private health insurance and managed care plans often varies based on the type of contract or plan purchased.\nCurrent healthcare laws and regulations and future legislative or regulatory reforms to the healthcare system may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nThe United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.\nWe expect that healthcare reform measures, including the potential repeal and replacement of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), that may be adopted in the future, may have a significant impact on our business. Most recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts was enacted, which, among other things, removed penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. Additionally, all or a portion of PPACA and related subsequent legislation may be modified, repealed or otherwise invalidated through judicial challenge, which could result in lower numbers of insured individuals, reduced coverage for insured individuals and adversely affect our business. If PPACA is repealed or replaced, it is unclear how the replacement statute may impact our business. If PPACA is not repealed or replaced, it will continue to impose requirements on our business.\nMoreover, certain politicians, including the President, have announced intentions to propose initiatives to regulate the prices of pharmaceutical products. We cannot know what form any such legislation may take or the market\u2019s perception of how such legislation would affect us. Any reduction in reimbursement from government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our current products and/or those for which we may receive regulatory approval in the future.\nIn China, the newly created National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA), an agency responsible for administering China\u2019s social security system, organized a price negotiation with drug companies for 18 oncology drugs in October 2018, which resulted in a price reduction by over 50%. The NHSA included 17 of the 18 oncology drugs on the NRDL after the price negotiation. We may also be invited to attend the price negotiation with NHSA upon receiving regulatory approval in China, but we will likely need to significantly reduce our prices, and to negotiate with each of the provincial healthcare security administrations on reimbursement ratios. If we were to successfully launch commercial sales of Melphalan Hydrochloride For Injection (EVOMELA), our revenue from such sales is largely expected to be self-paid by patients, which may make our drug candidates less desirable. On the other hand, if the NHSA or any of its local counterpart includes our Melphalan Hydrochloride For Injection (EVOMELA) in the NRDL or provincial RDL, which may increase the demand for our drug candidates, our potential revenue from the sales of our drug candidates may still decrease as a result of lower prices.\nThe success of our business depends upon the members of our senior management team and our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified clinical, technical and business personnel.\nWe are dependent on the principal members of our senior management team and clinical development team for our business success. The loss of any of these people could impede the achievement of our development and business objectives. We do not carry key man life insurance on the lives of any of our key personnel. There is intense competition for human resources, including management, in the scientific fields in which we operate and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the successful commercialization of our ANDA portfolio, development of our product candidates, and any expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise. In addition, there can be no assurance that such personnel or resources will be available when needed. We also rely on a significant number of consultants to assist us in formulating our clinical strategy and other business activities. All of our consultants may have commitments to, or advisory or consulting agreements with, other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nRisks Relating to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nIndependent clinical investigators and contract research organizations that we engage to conduct our clinical trials may not devote sufficient time or attention to our clinical trials or be able to repeat their past success.\nWe depend on independent clinical investigators and contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) to assist in the conduct of our clinical trials under their agreements with us. The investigators are not our employees, and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. If independent investigators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug development programs, or if their performance is substandard, it could delay the approval of our FDA applications and our introduction of new drugs. The CROs we contract with to assist with the execution of our clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of the trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. Failure of the CROs to meet their obligations could adversely affect clinical development of our products.\nWe have no current manufacturing or marketing capacity and rely on only one supplier for some of our products.\nWe plan to build and operate a manufacturing facility in the Wuxi Huishan Economic Development Zone in Jiangsu Province, China. We do not currently have the capacity to manufacture or market products and we have limited experience in these activities. The manufacturing processes for all of the small molecules we are developing have not yet been tested at commercial levels, and it may not be possible to manufacture these materials in a cost-effective manner. If we elect to perform these functions, we will be required to either develop these capacities, or contract with others to perform some or all of these tasks. We may be dependent to a significant extent on corporate partners, licensees, or other entities for manufacturing and marketing of products. If we engage directly in manufacturing or marketing, we will require substantial additional funds and personnel and will be required to comply with extensive regulations. We may be unable to develop or contract for these capacities when required to do so in connection with our business.\nWe depend on our third-party manufacturers to perform their obligations effectively and on a timely basis. These third parties may not meet their obligations and any such non-performance may delay clinical development or submission of products for regulatory approval, or otherwise impair our competitive position. Any significant problem experienced by one of our suppliers could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of materials to us until such supplier resolves the problem or an alternative source of supply is located. Any delay or interruption would likely lead to a delay or interruption of manufacturing operations, which could negatively affect our operations. Although we have identified alternative suppliers for our product candidates, we have not entered into contractual or other arrangements with them. If we needed to use an alternate supplier for any product, we would experience delays while we negotiated an agreement with them for the manufacture of such product. In addition, we may be unable to negotiate manufacturing terms with a new supplier as favorable as the terms we have with our current suppliers.\nProblems with any manufacturing processes could result in product defects, which could require us to delay shipment of products or recall products previously shipped. In addition, any prolonged interruption in the operations of the manufacturing facilities of one of our sole-source suppliers could result in the cancellation of shipments. A number of factors could cause interruptions, including equipment malfunctions or failures, or damage to a facility due to natural disasters or otherwise. Our manufacturing processes are, and we expect future manufacturing processes to be, highly complex and subject to a lengthy regulatory approval process. Alternative qualified production capacity may not be available on a timely basis or at all. Difficulties or delays in our manufacturing could increase our costs and damage our reputation.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products can be an expensive, time consuming, and complex process. Manufacturers often encounter difficulties in scaling-up production of new products, including quality control and assurance and shortages of personnel. Delays in formulation and scale-up to commercial quantities could result in additional expense and delays in our clinical trials, regulatory submissions, and commercialization.\nFailure of manufacturing facilities producing our product candidates to maintain regulatory approval could delay or otherwise hinder our ability to market our product candidates.\nAny manufacturer of our product candidates will be subject to applicable Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prescribed by the FDA or other rules and regulations prescribed by the NMPA and other foreign regulatory authorities. We and any of our collaborators may be unable to enter into or maintain relationships either domestically or abroad with manufacturers whose facilities and procedures comply or will continue to comply with GMP and who are able to produce our small molecules in accordance with applicable regulatory standards. Failure by a manufacturer of our products to comply with GMP could result in significant time delays or our inability to obtain marketing approval or, should we have market approval, for such approval to continue. Changes in our manufacturers could require new product testing and facility compliance inspections. In the United States, failure to comply with GMP or other applicable legal requirements can lead to federal seizure of violated products, injunctive actions brought by the federal government, inability to export product, and potential criminal and civil liability on the part of a company and its officers and employees.\nRisks Relating to Our Auditors\nThe Audit Report Included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is Prepared by Auditors Who Are Not Currently Inspected by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and, as such, Our Stockholders are Deprived of the Benefits of Such Inspection.\nAs an auditor of companies that are publicly traded in the United States and a firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), our independent registered public accounting firm is required under the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB. However, because we have substantial operations within China, our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s audit documentation related to their audit report included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is located in China. The PCAOB is currently unable to conduct full inspections in China or review audit documentation located within China without the approval of Chinese authorities.\nInspections of other auditors conducted by the PCAOB outside of China have at times identified deficiencies in those auditors\u2019 audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The lack of PCAOB inspections of audit work undertaken in China prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our auditor\u2019s audits and its quality control procedures. As a result, stockholders may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections, and may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements.\nProceedings Instituted by the SEC Against Certain China-Based Accounting Firms, Including Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, Could Result in our Financial Statements being Determined to Not be in Compliance with the Requirements of the Exchange Act.\nIn late 2012, the SEC commenced administrative proceedings under Rule 102(e) of its Rules of Practice and also under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 against the Chinese member firms of the \u201cbig four\u201d accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm. The Rule 102(e) proceedings initiated by the SEC relate to the failure of these firms to produce certain documents, including audit work papers, in response to a request from the SEC pursuant to Section 106 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The auditors located in China claim they are not in a position lawfully to produce such documents directly to the SEC because of restrictions under Chinese law and specific directives issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (\u201cCSRC\u201d). The issues raised by the proceedings are not specific to our auditor or to us, but potentially affect equally all PCAOB-registered audit firms based in China and all businesses based in China (or with substantial operations in China) with securities listed in the United States. In addition, auditors based outside of China are subject to similar restrictions under Chinese law and CSRC directives in respect of audit work that is carried out in China which supports the audit opinions issued on financial statements of entities with substantial China operations.\nIf our independent registered public accounting firm were denied, even temporarily, the ability to practice before the SEC, and we are unable to timely find another independent registered public accounting firm to audit and issue an opinion on our financial statements, our financial statements could be determined not to be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act. Such a determination could ultimately lead to delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq. Moreover, any negative news about the proceedings against these audit firms may adversely affect investor confidence in companies with substantial China-based operations listed on securities exchanges in the United States. All of these factors could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe volatile price of our stock makes it difficult for investors to predict the value of their investments, to sell shares at a profit at any given time, or to plan purchases and sales in advance. Our common stock price has fluctuated from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to be volatile. During 2018, our stock price has ranged from $2.77 to $8.23. We expect that the trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile in response to a variety of factors that are beyond our control, such as:\n\u00b7 our ability to maintain regulatory approval for Melphalan Hydrochloride For Injection (EVOMELA) and obtain regulatory approval for our other product candidates;\n\u00b7 issues in importation, marketing and sales of Melphalan Hydrochloride For Injection (EVOMELA);\n\u00b7 the results of our current and any future clinical trials of Ibritumomab Tiuxetan (ZEVALIN) or our other product candidates;\n\u00b7 the success of our joint venture to build and operate a manufacturing facility in China;\n\u00b7 the commercialization of our portfolio of ANDAs;\n\u00b7 publicity regarding actual or potential clinical test results relating to products under development by our competitors or us;\n\u00b7 initiating, completing or analyzing, or a delay or failure in initiating, completing or analyzing, pre-clinical or clinical trials or animal trials or the design or results of these trials for products in development;\n\u00b7 the entry into, or termination of, key agreements, including key commercial partner agreements;\n\u00b7 the initiation of, material developments in, or conclusion of litigation to enforce or defend any of our intellectual property rights or defend against the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u00b7 achievement or rejection of regulatory approvals for products in development by our competitors or us;\n\u00b7 announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by our competitors or us;\n\u00b7 developments concerning our collaborations and supply chain;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u00b7 economic or other crises and other external factors;\n\u00b7 the loss of key employees;\n\u00b7 period-to-period fluctuations in our revenues and other results of operations;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; or\n\u00b7 publicity or activity involving possible future acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships or alliances.\nWe will not be able to control many of these factors, and we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our financial results will not necessarily be indicative of our future performance. The valuations of many biotechnology companies without consistent product revenues and earnings are extraordinarily high based on conventional valuation standards, such as price to earnings and price to sales ratios. These trading prices and valuations may not be sustained. In the future, our operating results in a particular period may not meet the expectations of any securities analysts whose attention we may attract, or those of our investors, which may result in a decline in the market price of our common stock. Any negative change in the public\u2019s perception of the prospects of biotechnology companies could depress our stock price regardless of our results of operations. These factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who may cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline.\nOur largest holders of common stock may have different interests than our other stockholders.\nA small number of our stockholders hold a significant amount of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders may have interests that are different from the interests of our other stockholders. We cannot assure that our largest stockholders will not seek to influence our business in a manner that is contrary to our goals or strategies or the interests of our other stockholders. In addition, the significant concentration of ownership in our common stock may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with significant stockholders. Our largest stockholders, if they acted together, could significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. Our largest stockholders together may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval.\nSubsequent resales of shares of our common stock in the public market may cause the market price of our common stock to fall.\nThe market value of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by investors from time to time, or perceptions that such sales may occur, of a substantial amount of the shares of common stock held by them.\nIssuances of additional shares of our common stock may cause substantial dilution of existing stockholders.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, future strategic relationships, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any additional shares of our common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with any capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of our common stock are then traded.", "PERMNO": 83651, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "CASI"}
