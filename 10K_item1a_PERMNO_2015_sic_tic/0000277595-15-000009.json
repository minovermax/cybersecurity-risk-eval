RISK FACTORS\nThe future success and continued viability of our business, like any venture, is subject to many recognized and unrecognized risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management. The following list identifies and briefly summarizes certain risk factors. The list should not be viewed as complete or comprehensive, as the risks below are not the only risks facing Energen. Energen could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties we currently deem to be immaterial or risks that are currently not known or have yet to be identified by us. If any of the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected; and such events could impair our ability to implement business plans or complete development activities as scheduled. In such a case, the trading price of our shares could decline; and shareholders could lose part or all of their investment.\nWe undertake no obligation to correct or update such risk factors whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with our disclosure specific to forward-looking statements made elsewhere in this report under the heading Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nCommodity prices for crude oil and natural gas are volatile, and a substantial reduction in commodity prices could adversely affect our financial results and operations.\nOur business is significantly impacted by commodity prices, and historical markets for oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas have been volatile. Energen\u2019s revenues, operating results, profitability and cash flows depend primarily upon the prices realized for our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production.\nWe have more oil proved reserves than natural gas proved reserves, so oil prices are more likely to have an impact on our business than natural gas prices. Approximately 49 percent of our December 31, 2014 proved reserves are oil. Commodity prices for oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas are reflections of supply and demand and are subject to many factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe domestic and foreign supply of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, including the ability of the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporting countries to agree on and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer demand for oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas;\n\u2022\nglobal oil and natural gas inventory levels;\n\u2022\nthe availability, proximity and capacity of transportation facilities and processing facilities;\n\u2022\nworldwide economic conditions;\n\u2022\ncommodity price disparities between delivery points and applicable index prices;\n\u2022\nthe supply, demand and pricing of alternative sources of energy or fuels and the effects of energy conservation efforts or technological advances in energy consumption;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in political conditions in major oil and natural gas producing regions and\n\u2022\ndomestic, local and foreign governmental regulations and taxes.\nSubstantial reductions in oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices would reduce our revenue and cash flows and potentially reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can economically produce resulting in a reduction in the proved oil and natural gas reserves we could recognize. Thus, significant and sustained commodity price reductions could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations which could impact our ability to maintain or increase our current levels of borrowing, our ability to repay current or future indebtedness, our ability to refinance our current indebtedness or obtain additional capital on attractive terms.\nOur oil and natural gas proved reserves are estimates, and actual future production may vary significantly and may also be negatively impacted by our inability to invest in production on planned timelines.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures. Reserve estimation is a subjective process involving the estimation of volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that are unable to be measured in an exact manner. The reserve estimation process is dependent upon and subject to multiple variables and assumptions, including:\n\u2022\noil, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\ntiming of development expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe quality, quantity and interpretation of available geological, geophysical and engineering data;\n\u2022\nthe geologic characteristics of the reservoirs;\n\u2022\nfuture operating costs, property, severance, excise and other taxes and costs and\n\u2022\nthe effects of compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements.\nAdditionally, in the event we are unable to fully invest or must alter the timing of our planned investment expenditures, our future revenues, production and proved reserves could be negatively affected.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high-risk activities with many uncertainties that could impact our expenses or our production volumes.\nDrilling involves many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be located or economically developed. Our future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. Anticipated drilling plans and capital expenditures may also be delayed, curtailed or canceled which could result in actual drilling and capital expenditures being substantially different than currently planned, due to:\n\u2022\ndelays resulting from compliance with regulatory or contractual requirements, which may include limitations on hydraulic\nfracturing or the emission of greenhouse gases;\n\u2022\nunexpected or unusual pressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\ndeclines in oil, natural gas liquids or natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions, such as tornadoes, snow and ice storms;\n\u2022\ndelays in, limited availability of, or cost to obtain personnel and equipment necessary to complete our drilling,\ncompletion and operating activities;\n\u2022\nequipment or facility failures and accidents or malfunctions resulting in blowouts, fires, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, surface cratering and other events;\n\u2022\ntitle related issues;\n\u2022\nfracture stimulation failures;\n\u2022\nrestricted access to land for drilling;\n\u2022\nreductions in availability of financing at acceptable rates;\n\u2022\nstrategic changes implemented by management and\n\u2022\nlimitations in the market for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.\nWhile all drilling, whether developmental, extension or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory and extension drilling involve greater risks of dry holes or failure to find and exploit commercially productive quantities of oil and natural gas. We expect to continue to experience exploration and abandonment expense in 2015 and future years.\nOur concentration of producing properties in the Permian Basin of west Texas and the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and Colorado makes us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in limited geographic areas.\nAt December 31, 2014, approximately 75 percent and 24 percent of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in the Permian Basin of west Texas and San Juan Basin of New Mexico, respectively. As a result of this geographic concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in these areas caused by:\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulation;\n\u2022\nstate politics;\n\u2022\nprocessing or transportation capacity constraints;\n\u2022\nmarket limitations;\n\u2022\nwater shortages, including restrictions on water usage or other drought related conditions or\n\u2022\ninterruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas liquids or natural gas.\nOur industry is highly competitive which makes it challenging for us to acquire properties to replace our proved oil and natural gas reserves, market oil and natural gas and locate and secure qualified personnel.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties to replace our proved oil and natural gas reserves, marketing oil and natural gas and locating and securing qualified personnel. Many of our current and potential competitors possess greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we do. Those competitors may be willing to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties, as well as for trained personnel. Our ability to acquire properties and to find and develop proved reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to execute transactions in an intensely competitive environment. Our failure to acquire properties, market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.\nOur business is capital intensive, and we may not be able to obtain the needed capital, financing, or to refinance our current indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all.\nOur exploration, development and acquisition activities are capital intensive and constitute the primary use of our capital resources. We make and expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures for the exploration, development and acquisition of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves. We have historically funded our capital expenditures through cash flows from operations, our credit facility and other borrowings.\nIf our borrowing capacity decreases, for any reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to support our future operations. If we are unable to obtain necessary financing with appropriate terms, we could experience a decline in our operations. Specifically, a failure to secure additional financing, or necessary refinancing, could result in a reduction of our operations relating to the development of future prospects, which in turn could lead to a decline in our proved oil and natural gas reserves and could adversely affect our future production, revenues and results of operations. The borrowing base of our credit facility is subject to periodic redetermination and is based in part on oil and natural gas prices. A lowering of our borrowing base because of lower oil and natural gas prices or for other reasons could require us to repay indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base, or we might need to further secure the lenders with additional collateral.\nThe nature of our operations involves many operational risks including the risk of personal injury, property damage and environmental damage, and our insurance policies do not cover all such risks.\nInherent in our oil and natural gas production activities are a variety of hazards and operational risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\npipeline and storage leaks, ruptures and spills;\n\u2022\nequipment malfunctions and mechanical failures;\n\u2022\nfires and explosions;\n\u2022\nwell blowouts, explosions and cratering;\n\u2022\nuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids;\n\u2022\nvandalism;\n\u2022\npollution;\n\u2022\nreleases of toxic gases;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions or natural disasters and\n\u2022\nsoil, surface and water or groundwater contamination from petroleum constituents, hydraulic fracturing fluid, or produced water.\nSuch events could result in loss of human life, significant damage to or destruction of property, environmental pollution or other damage, impairment or suspension of our operations, repair and remediation costs, regulatory investigations and penalties or lawsuits and other substantial financial losses. Furthermore, our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including those noted above. Additionally, the location of certain of our pipeline and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks.\nIn accordance with customary industry practices, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses; and the insurance coverages are subject to retention levels and coverage limits. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Furthermore, we could be subject to the credit risk of our insurers if we make a claim under our insurance policies. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain our insurance in the future at rates we deem economical\nand that the insurance we may desire will be offered by insurers. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or under-insured events or insurer insolvency, in the event of a claim, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, including numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations as well as legislation and regulations restricting the emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d that may require significant expenditures or impose significant restrictions on our operations.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation which significantly influences our operations. Federal, state and local legislative bodies and agencies frequently exercise their respective authority to adopt new laws and regulations and to amend, modify and interpret existing laws and regulations. Such changes can subject us to significant tax or increased expenditures and can impose significant restrictions and limitations on our operations. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial cleanups, and natural resource damages or other liabilities. Furthermore, we may incur significant costs to remain in compliance with or to return to compliance with applicable regulations if they are revised or reinterpreted or if governmental policies or laws change related to our operations.\nThe subject of climate change is receiving increasing attention from many parties including legislators and governmental agencies. Debate over whether the climate is changing, possible causes and other possible impacts has been ongoing for several years.\nIf additional legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases are adopted, it could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as those for purchasing and operating emissions control systems, acquiring emissions allowances or complying with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming and using oil and natural gas, and thereby negatively impact the demand for the oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs related to greenhouse gases could adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing, as well as governmental reviews of such activities, could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our production.\nEnergen regularly utilizes hydraulic fracturing in its drilling and completion activities, and hydraulic fracturing is a common practice that is used in the oil and gas industry to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight (low permeability) formations. After a well has been drilled, hydraulic fracturing is used during the completion process to form small fractures in the target formation through which the oil, natural gas liquids or natural gas can flow. The fractures are created when a water-based fluid is pumped at a calculated rate and pressure into the crude oil- or natural gas-bearing rock. The fracture fluid is a mixture composed primarily of water and sand or inert ceramic, sand-like grains; it also contains a small percentage of special purpose chemical additives (which are highly diluted-typically less than one percent by volume) that can vary by project. The millimeter-thick cracks or fractures in the target formation are propped open by the sand, thereby allowing the crude oil or natural gas to flow from tight reservoirs into the well bore.\nThe hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. However, under the Safe Drinking Water Act\u2019s Underground Injection Control Program, the EPA has assumed regulatory authority of hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives and issued revised permitting guidance in February 2014 requiring facilities to obtain permits to use diesel additives in hydraulic fracturing activities. Legislation intended to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and require disclosure of the chemicals used has been introduced and considered by the U.S. Congress. In addition, Texas and New Mexico, two states in which we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose new or stricter permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on companies that perform hydraulic fracturing. Consideration and efforts to regulate hydraulic fracturing by local, state and federal authorities are increasing; and local land use restrictions, such as county and city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit any type of drilling or hydraulic fracturing. If additional federal, state or local restrictions are adopted in the areas we operate or plan to operate, we may incur significant costs to comply with the requirements, experience delays or have to curtail our exploration, development, or production activities. Additionally, such restrictions could reduce the amount of oil and gas that we are able to recover from our proved reserves.\nOur operations are dependent on the availability, use and disposal of water; and restrictions on our ability to acquire or dispose of water could cause us to incur substantial costs in the acquisition, usage and disposal of water.\nWater is a key component of both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to obtain water from various local sources for use in our operations. Texas is experiencing severe drought conditions that have persisted for the last several years. Several local water districts may begin restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for drilling and\nhydraulic fracturing in order to protect the local water supply during the drought conditions. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may have to incur substantial costs to produce oil and natural gas and it may make it uneconomical to produce in that area. Our drilling procedures produce water of which we must dispose. We could be unable to dispose of our wastewater or face increased costs and procedures for disposal as a result of changes in federal or local legislation governing the disposal of drilling wastewater.\nWe periodically evaluate our proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties for impairment and could be required to recognize non-cash charges in our statements of income in future periods. If commodity prices for oil, natural gas liquids or natural gas decline or our drilling efforts are unsuccessful, we may be required to writedown the carrying values of certain oil and natural gas properties.\nWe periodically review the carrying value of our proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment on a field-by-field basis. We monitor our oil and natural gas properties as well as the market and business environments in which we operate and make assessments about events that could result in potential impairment issues, which include, but are not limited to, downward commodity price trends, unanticipated increased operating costs and lower than expected production performance. If a material event occurs, we perform an evaluation to determine whether the asset is impaired. If the quantity of potential reserves determined by such evaluations is insufficient to fully recover the cost invested in the respective project, we will record an impairment loss in our statements of income.\nWe are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our concentrated customer base.\nRevenues and related accounts receivable from oil and natural gas operations primarily are generated from the sale of produced oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas to a small number of energy marketing companies. Such sales are typically made on an unsecured credit basis with payment due the month following delivery. This concentration of sales to a limited number of customers in the energy marketing industry has the potential to affect our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, based on changes in economic, industry or other conditions specific to a single customer or to the energy marketing industry generally. We consider the credit quality of our customers and, in certain instances, may require credit assurances such as a deposit, letter of credit or parent company guarantee.\nWe are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks. Volatility in global financial markets, negative operating results, certain strategic business decisions, or other matters resulting in a downgrade in, or a negative outlook with respect to, our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of and our ability to access capital for future development and working capital needs.\nWe rely on access to credit markets, and turmoil or volatility in the global financial markets could lead to a contraction in credit availability and negatively impact our ability to finance our operations. Global financial market turmoil, as has been experienced in last decade, could materially affect our operations, liquidity and financial condition through the adverse impacts such turmoil can have on the debt and equity capital markets. Market volatility and credit market disruption may severely limit credit availability, and issuer credit ratings can change rapidly. A significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities or reduce cash flow used for drilling which could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results.\nThe availability and cost of credit market access is significantly influenced by market events and rating agency evaluations for lenders and Energen. In addition to operating results, business decisions relating to recapitalization, refinancing, restructuring, acquisition and disposition transactions involving Energen may negatively impact market and rating agency considerations regarding the credit of Energen, and management periodically considers these types of transactions.\nOur derivative risk management activities may limit our potential gains and involve other risks that could result in financial losses.\nAlthough we make use of futures, swaps, options, collars and fixed-price contracts to mitigate price risk, fluctuations in future oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, such risk mitigation activities may cause our financial position and results of operations to be materially different from results that would have been obtained had such risk mitigation activities not been implemented. The changes in the fair market value of our derivative contracts as reported in our consolidated statements of income may result in significant non-cash gains or losses.\nThe effectiveness of such risk mitigation assumes that counterparties maintain satisfactory credit quality and that actual sales volumes will generally meet or exceed the volumes subject to the futures, swaps, options, collars and fixed-price contracts. A substantial failure to meet sales volume targets, whether caused by miscalculations, weather events, natural disaster, accident, mechanical failure, criminal act or otherwise, could leave us financially exposed to our counterparties and result in material adverse financial consequences to Energen. The adverse effect could be increased if the adverse event was widespread enough to move market prices against our position.\nDerivatives reform legislation which has been adopted by the U.S. Congress, or additions to or changes in the legislation, could negatively impact our ability to use derivative instruments as part of our risk management activities.\nIn July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) was signed into law. Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives markets and participants in such markets and requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC to promulgate implementing rules and regulations. These rules and regulations will cover, among other transactions, transactions linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. We believe Energen\u2019s derivative transactions qualify for the end-user exception which exempts them from certain Dodd-Frank Act margin and exchange clearing requirements pursuant to final regulations adopted by the CFTC and SEC and published in the Federal Register on July 19, 2012.\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and the associated rules also will require Energen, in connection with covered derivative activities, to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. Although we believe we qualify for the end-user exception from the mandatory clearing requirements for swaps entered to mitigate our commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market participants, such as dealers, may change the cost and availability of our future derivative arrangements. The changes in the regulation of swaps may result in certain market participants deciding to curtail or stop engaging in derivative activities. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures and our results of operations.\nOur operations depend on the use of third-party facilities, and an interruption of our ability to utilize these facilities may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nEnergen delivers to third-party facilities. These facilities include third-party oil and natural gas gathering, transportation, processing and storage facilities. Energen relies on such facilities for access to market for our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production. Such facilities are typically limited in number and geographically concentrated. A lack of available capacity on these facilities could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties for Energen. An extended interruption of access to or service from these facilities, whether caused by weather events, natural disaster, accident, mechanical failure, criminal act, maintenance or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nThe success of our future operations is dependent on our future drilling activities and our ability to economically develop our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves; and our expectations regarding future drilling and development activities are subject to uncertainties that could significantly alter the occurrence or timing of such activities, as they are expected to be realized over multiple years.\nWe have identified drilling locations and prospects for future drilling, including development and exploratory drilling activities. Our ability to successfully and economically drill and develop these locations depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nprices of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas;\n\u2022\ncurrent laws or regulations or changes in the laws or regulations in the identified and prospective locations;\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of capital;\n\u2022\nseasonal and other weather conditions;\n\u2022\nregulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nnegotiation of agreements with third parties;\n\u2022\naccess to and availability of required equipment, supplies and personnel and\n\u2022\ndrilling results.\nBecause of the factors noted above, we cannot provide any guarantee regarding the timing or success of future drilling activities; and our actual drilling activities may materially differ from our current expectations.\nEnergen has limited control over activities on properties which we do not operate, which could materially reduce our production and revenues.\nEnergen operates in certain instances through joint ventures under joint operating agreements. Typically, the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts, such as drilling contracts, for the benefit of all joint venture partners. Through the joint operating agreement, the non-operators reimburse, and in some cases advance, the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator. For properties we do not operate, we have limited ability to control the operation or future development of the properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. An operator\u2019s failure to adequately perform operations, an operator\u2019s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator\u2019s failure to act in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues. The success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others is dependent on a number of factors, including the operator's timing and amount of capital expenditures, expertise and financial resources, inclusion of other participants in drilling wells and use of technology. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to control the operation and future development of these properties could negatively affect the realization of our expected returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and could lead to unexpected costs in the future.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats and related disruptions.\nWe face a variety of security threats, including cybersecurity threats to access sensitive information or render data or systems unusable, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or those of third parties, including processing plants and pipelines, and threats from terrorist acts. Current procedures and controls may not be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring, and we could have to implement additional procedures and controls to mitigate the effects of potential breaches and monitor for potential security threats resulting in increased capital and operating costs. In the event of a security breach, losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations could occur and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operations, financial position and results of operations. Cybersecurity attacks are becoming more sophisticated and prevalent and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, other electronic security breaches that could cause disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential information and data corruption. Furthermore, some experts claim that cybersecurity attacks have become a weapon of war and espionage. As we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit and store electronic information critical for the efficient operation of our business and day-to-day operations, such attacks could lead to a material disruption in our business, including the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data or other business information, financial losses, loss of business, potential liability and damage our reputation.", "PERMNO": 26470, "SIC": 4924, "TIC": "EGN"}
