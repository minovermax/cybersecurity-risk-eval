{"cik": "1529113", "company": "INPIXON", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to various risks that may materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. An investment in our common stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. In evaluating an investment in shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this report.\nIf any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occurs, or if additional risks and uncertainties later materialize, that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, then our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and investors in our common stock may lose all or part of their investment in our shares. The risks discussed below include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to Our Consolidated Operations\nWe have completed five acquisitions since 2013, including Lilien, Shoom, AirPatrol, LightMiner and Integrio, and may pursue a divestiture of our VAR Business which includes the businesses acquired from Lilien and Integrio, which may make it difficult for potential investors to evaluate our future consolidated business. Furthermore, due to the risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition of new businesses, any such acquisition does not guarantee that we will be able to attain profitability.\nBetween March 2013 and November 2016, we completed five acquisitions and are currently contemplating a divesture of our VAR Business. Our limited combined operating history makes it difficult for potential investors to evaluate our business or prospective operations or the merits of an investment in our securities. We are subject to the risks inherent in the financing, expenditures, complications and delays characteristic of a newly combined business. These risks are described below under the risk factor titled \u201cAny future acquisitions that we may make could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and harm our business, financial condition or operating results.\u201d In addition, while the former affiliates of four of these businesses have indemnified the Company from any undisclosed liabilities, there may not be adequate resources to cover such indemnity. Furthermore, there are risks that the vendors, suppliers and customers of these acquired entities may not renew their relationships for which there is no indemnification. Accordingly, our business and success faces risks from uncertainties inherent to developing companies in a competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that we will ultimately be able to attain profitability.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate the business and operations of entities that we have acquired or may acquire in the future into our ongoing business operations, which may result in our inability to fully realize the intended benefits of these acquisitions, or may disrupt our current operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and/or results of operations.\nWe continue to integrate the operations of AirPatrol and LightMiner, and Integrio into Inpixon Federal (effective January 1, 2016, Shoom and AirPatrol were merged into Lilien, which changed its name to Sysorex USA and then to Inpixon USA on March 1, 2017) and this process involves complex operational, technological and personnel-related challenges, which are time-consuming and expensive and may disrupt our ongoing business operations. Furthermore, integration involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf difficulties or complications in combining the companies\u2019 operations;\n\u25cf differences in controls, procedures and policies, regulatory standards and business cultures among the combined companies;\n\u25cf the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our ongoing core business operations;\n\u25cf increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements;\n\u25cf the potential loss of key personnel;\n\u25cf the potential loss of key customers or suppliers who choose not to do business with the combined business;\n\u25cf difficulties or delays in consolidating the acquired companies\u2019 technology platforms, including implementing systems designed to continue to ensure that the Company maintains effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting for the combined company and enable the Company to continue to comply with U.S. GAAP and applicable U.S. securities laws and regulations;\n\u25cf unanticipated costs and other assumed contingent liabilities;\n\u25cf difficulty comparing financial reports due to differing financial and/or internal reporting systems;\n\u25cf making any necessary modifications to internal financial control standards to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; and/or\n\u25cf possible tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company.\nThese factors could cause us to not fully realize the anticipated financial and/or strategic benefits of the acquisitions and the recent reorganization, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nEven if we are able to successfully operate the businesses of AirPatrol and LightMiner and, to the extent that a sale or divesture of Inpixon USA is not consummated, Integrio within Inpixon Federal, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from these acquisitions in the time frame that we currently expect, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we currently expect, because of a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the possibility that the acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected;\n\u25cf the possibility that we may not be able to expand the reach and customer base for the acquired companies current and future products as expected; and\n\u25cf the possibility that the carrying amounts of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets may not be recoverable.\nAs a result of these risks, the acquisitions and integration may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve expected revenue synergies or our return on invested capital targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the acquisitions and the reorganization.\nThe risks arising with respect to the historic business and operations of our recent acquisition targets may be different from what we anticipate, which could significantly increase the costs and decrease the benefits of the acquisition and materially and adversely affect our operations going forward.\nAlthough we performed significant financial, legal, technological and business due diligence with respect to our recent acquisition targets, we may not have appreciated, understood or fully anticipated the extent of the risks associated with the acquisitions. We have secured indemnification for certain matters from the former equity holders of Lilien, Shoom, AirPatrol and Integrio in order to mitigate the consequences of breaches of representations, warranties and covenants under the merger agreements and the risks associated with historic operations, including those with respect to compliance with laws, accuracy of financial statements, financial reporting controls and procedures, tax matters and undisclosed liabilities, and certain matters known to us. We believe that the indemnification provisions of the merger agreements, together with any applicable holdback escrows (in the case of AirPatrol, Shoom and LightMiner) and insurance policies that we have in place will limit the economic consequences of the issues we have identified in our due diligence to acceptable levels. Notwithstanding our exercise of due diligence and risk mitigation strategies, the risks of the acquisition and the costs associated with these risks may be greater than we anticipate. We may not be able to contain or control the costs associated with unanticipated risks or liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, capital resources or results of operations.\nA significant portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of Lilien, Shoom, AirPatrol, LightMiner and Integrio is allocated to goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to periodic impairment evaluations. An impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company acquired $4.5 million of goodwill and $5.4 million of intangible assets relating to our acquisition of Lilien, $1.2 million of goodwill and $2.8 million of intangible assets relating to our acquisition of Shoom, $7.4 million of goodwill and $13.3 million of intangible assets relating to our acquisition of AirPatrol, $3.5 million of intangible assets relating to our acquisition of LightMiner and $3.3 million of goodwill and $4.9 million of intangible assets relating to our acquisition of Integrio. As required by current accounting standards, we review intangible assets for impairment either annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The risk of impairment to goodwill is higher during the early years following an acquisition. This is because the fair values of these assets align very closely with what we paid to acquire the reporting units to which these assets are assigned. As a result, the difference between the carrying value of the reporting unit and its fair value (typically referred to as \u201cheadroom\u201d) is smaller at the time of acquisition. Until this headroom grows over time, due to business growth or lower carrying value of the reporting unit, a relatively small decrease in reporting unit fair value can trigger impairment charges. When impairment charges are triggered, they tend to be material due to the size of the assets involved. Our business would be adversely affected, and impairment of goodwill could be triggered, if any of the following were to occur: higher attrition rates than planned as a result of the competitive environment or our inability to provide products and services that are competitive in the marketplace, lower-than-planned adoption rates by customers, higher-than-expected expense levels to provide services to clients, and changes in our business model that may impact one or more of these variables. During the year ended December 31, 2016 we recorded an impairment charge for goodwill in the amount of $7.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017 we recorded an impairment charge for goodwill of $8.4 million.\nOur acquisitions may expose us to additional liabilities, and insurance and indemnification coverage may not fully protect us from these liabilities.\nUpon completion of acquisitions, we may be exposed to unknown or contingent liabilities associated with the acquired entity, and if these liabilities exceed our estimates, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and negatively affected.\nOur ability to successfully execute our business plan may require additional debt or equity financing, which may otherwise not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nAccording to our business plan we may need additional debt or equity financing. Future financings through equity offerings by us will be dilutive to existing stockholders. Also, the terms of securities we may issue in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors than our current investors. Newly issued securities may include preferences, superior voting rights, the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities. We may also issue incentive awards under employee equity incentive plans, which may have additional dilutive effects. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue in the future such as convertible notes and warrants, which would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to obtain needed financing may be impaired by factors, including the condition of the economy and capital markets, both generally and specifically in our industry, and the fact that we are not profitable, which could impact the availability or cost of future financing. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with our revenues from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, we may need to reduce our operations by, for example, selling certain assets or business segments.\nFailure to manage or protect growth may be detrimental to our business because our infrastructure may not be adequate for expansion.\nOur recent acquisitions require a substantial expansion of the Company\u2019s systems, workforce and facilities and we anticipate that we may need to consummate additional acquisitions in connection with the expansion of our indoor positioning business. We may fail to adequately manage our anticipated future growth. The substantial growth in our operations as a result of our acquisitions has, and is expected to continue to, place a significant strain on our administrative, financial and operational resources, and increase demands on our management and on our operational and administrative systems, controls and other resources. There can be no assurance that our systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support our operations as they expand. We cannot assure you that our existing personnel, systems, procedures or controls will be adequate to support our operations in the future or that we will be able to successfully implement appropriate measures consistent with our growth strategy. As part of this growth, we may have to implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls to expand, train and manage our employee base, and maintain close coordination among our staff. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so, or that if we are able to do so, we will be able to effectively integrate them into our existing staff and systems.\nTo the extent we acquire other businesses, we will also need to integrate and assimilate new operations, technologies and personnel. The integration of new personnel will continue to result in some disruption to ongoing operations. The ability to effectively manage growth in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning and management processes. We will need to continue to improve operational, financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures, and will need to continue to expand, train and manage our work force. There can be no assurance that the Company would be able to accomplish such an expansion on a timely basis. If the Company is unable to effect any required expansion and is unable to perform its contracts on a timely and satisfactory basis, its reputation and eligibility to secure additional contracts in the future could be damaged. The failure to perform could also result in contract terminations and significant liability. Any such result would adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial condition.\nOur financial status raises doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur cash and cash equivalents were $141,000 at December 31, 2017, compared with $1.8 million at December 31, 2016. We continue to incur significant operating losses, and management expects that significant on-going operating expenditures will be necessary to successfully implement our business plan and develop and market our products. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are issued. Implementation of our plans and our ability to continue as a going concern will depend upon our ability to market our technology and raise additional capital.\nManagement believes that we have access to capital resources through possible public or private equity offerings, exchange offers, debt financings, corporate collaborations or other means. In addition, we continue to explore opportunities to strategically monetize our technology and our services, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful with such plans. We have historically been able to raise capital through equity offerings, although no assurance can be provided that we will continue to be successful in the future. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital through 2018 or otherwise, we will not be able to pay our obligations as they become due.\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth, which could hurt our financial performance.\nIn addition to employees hired in connection with our recent acquisitions and any other companies which we may acquire in the future, we anticipate that we will need to expand our employee infrastructure for managerial, operational, financial and other resources at the parent company level. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate additional employees. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively.\nIn order to manage our future growth, we will need to continue to improve our management, operational and financial controls and our reporting systems and procedures. All of these measures will require significant expenditures and will demand the attention of management. If we do not continue to enhance our management personnel and our operational and financial systems and controls in response to growth in our business, we could experience operating inefficiencies that could impair our competitive position and could increase our costs more than we had planned. If we are unable to manage growth effectively, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of operating losses and working capital deficiency and there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability or raise additional financing.\nWe have a history of operating losses and working capital deficiency. We have incurred recurring net losses of approximately $27.5 million and $35.0 million for the fiscal years ended 2016 and 2017, respectively. We had a working capital deficiency of approximately $21.0 million and $32.8 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The continuation of our Company is dependent upon attaining and maintaining profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any further financing.\nOur ability to generate positive cash flow from operations is dependent upon sustaining certain cost reductions and generating sufficient revenues. In that regard, our revenues have declined by approximately 75% for Q4 2017 and 15% for the year ended December 31 2017, respectively, as compared to the same periods for the prior fiscal year as a result of our credit limitations with vendors and suppliers limiting our ability to process orders in our Infrastructure/VAR segment. Our management is evaluating options and strategic transactions including possibly divesting our infrastructure segment and continuing to market and promote our new products and technologies, however, there is no guarantee that these efforts will be successful or that any such transaction will be consummated or that or that we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability. We have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from public and private offerings of our common stock and secured and unsecured debt instruments. Our history of operating losses and cash uses, our projections of the level of cash that will be required for our operations to reach profitability, and the terms of the financing transactions that we completed in the past, may impair our ability to raise capital on terms that we consider reasonable and at the levels that we will require over the coming months. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to secure additional funding from public or private offerings or debt financings on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain the requisite amount of financing needed to fund our planned operations, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to continue as a going concern, and we may have to curtail, or even to cease, certain operations. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities or convertible debt securities, it will be dilutive to our stockholders and could result in a decrease in our stock price.\nThe reorganization transactions we carried out in 2015 and the name change completed in 2017 may cause us to be in a technical breach of certain third-party agreements.\nIn 2015, we carried out a series of reorganization transactions to streamline the organizational structure within the Company and both its direct and indirect subsidiaries. In addition, in February 2017, we changed our corporate name. Although these transactions occurred solely within the Company and its subsidiaries, there still may have been an obligation to either provide notice and/or seek consent from certain third parties pursuant to the contracts we have with these parties. We have reviewed and addressed these requirements; however, our failure to comply with any of these notice or consent requirements may have left us in a technical breach, thus possibly subjecting us to potential liabilities or an early termination under the applicable contracts. As of the date of this filing there are no known breaches.\nOur business depends on experienced and skilled personnel, and if we are unable to attract and integrate skilled personnel, it will be more difficult for us to manage our business and complete contracts.\nThe success of our business depends on the skill of our personnel. Accordingly, it is critical that we maintain, and continue to build, a highly experienced management team and specialized workforce, including those who create software programs and sales professionals. Competition for personnel, particularly those with expertise in government consulting and a security clearance, is high, and identifying candidates with the appropriate qualifications can be costly and difficult. We may not be able to hire the necessary personnel to implement our business strategy given our anticipated hiring needs, or we may need to provide higher compensation or more training to our personnel than we currently anticipate. In addition, our ability to recruit, hire and indirectly deploy former employees of the U.S. Government is subject to complex laws and regulations, which may serve as an impediment to our ability to attract such former employees.\nOur business is labor intensive and our success depends on our ability to attract, retain, train and motivate highly skilled employees, including employees who may become part of our organization in connection with our acquisitions. The increase in demand for consulting, technology integration and managed services has further increased the need for employees with specialized skills or significant experience in these areas. Our ability to expand our operations will be highly dependent on our ability to attract a sufficient number of highly skilled employees and to retain our employees and the employees of companies that we have acquired. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining enough employees to achieve our desired expansion or staffing plans. Furthermore, the industry turnover rates for these types of employees are high and we may not be successful in retaining, training or motivating our employees. Any inability to attract, retain, train and motivate employees could impair our ability to adequately manage and complete existing projects and to accept new client engagements. Such inability may also force us to increase our hiring of independent contractors, which may increase our costs and reduce our profitability on client engagements. We must also devote substantial managerial and financial resources to monitoring and managing our workforce. Our future success will depend on our ability to manage the levels and related costs of our workforce.\nIn the event we are unable to attract, hire and retain the requisite personnel and subcontractors, we may experience delays in completing contracts in accordance with project schedules and budgets, which may have an adverse effect on our financial results, harm our reputation and cause us to curtail our pursuit of new contracts. Further, any increase in demand for personnel may result in higher costs, causing us to exceed the budget on a contract, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results and harm our relationships with our customers.\nAny future acquisitions that we may make could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and harm our business, financial condition or operating results.\nIf we are successful in consummating acquisitions, those acquisitions could subject us to a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the purchase price we pay and/or unanticipated costs could significantly deplete our cash reserves or result in dilution to our existing stockholders;\n\u25cf we may find that the acquired company or technologies do not improve our market position as planned;\n\u25cf we may have difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired company, as the combined operations will place significant demands on the Company\u2019s management, technical, financial and other resources;\n\u25cf key personnel and customers of the acquired company may terminate their relationships with the acquired company as a result of the acquisition;\n\u25cf we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning and financial reporting;\n\u25cf we may assume or be held liable for risks and liabilities (including environmental-related costs) as a result of our acquisitions, some of which we may not be able to discover during our due diligence investigation or adequately adjust for in our acquisition arrangements;\n\u25cf our ongoing business and management\u2019s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically or culturally diverse enterprises;\n\u25cf we may incur one-time write-offs or restructuring charges in connection with the acquisition;\n\u25cf we may acquire goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to amortization or impairment tests, which could result in future charges to earnings; and\n\u25cf we may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated.\nWe cannot assure you that, following any acquisition, our continued business will achieve sales levels, profitability, efficiencies or synergies that justify the acquisition or that the acquisition will result in increased earnings for us in any future period. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nInsurance and contractual protections may not always cover lost revenue, increased expenses or liquidated damages payments, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nAlthough we maintain insurance and intend to obtain warranties from suppliers, obligate subcontractors to meet certain performance levels and attempt, where feasible, to pass risks we cannot control to our customers, the proceeds of such insurance or the warranties, performance guarantees or risk sharing arrangements may not be adequate to cover lost revenue, increased expenses or liquidated damages payments that may be required in the future.\nOur obligations to our senior secured lender, Payplant LLC (\u201cPayPlant\u201d), are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets, so if we default on those obligations, the lenders could foreclose on, liquidate and/or take possession of our assets. If that were to happen, we could be forced to curtail, or even to cease, our operations.\nWe issued a revolving Secured Promissory Note to GemCap Lending I, LLC dated as of November 14, 2016 which was assigned to Payplant on August 14, 2017 together with the Amended and Restated GemCap Loan and Security Agreement: Payplant Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of August 14, 2017 (the \u201cPayplant Loan Agreement\u201d). As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $1.1 million in outstanding revolving credit loans. All amounts due under the Secured Promissory Note and Debenture are secured by our assets. As a result, if we default on our obligations under the Secured Promissory Note, Payplant could foreclose on its security interest and liquidate or take possession of some or all of these assets, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and could require us to curtail, or even to cease our operations.\nPayplant, the Debenture Holders and the holders of convertible promissory notes (the \u201cNovember 2017 Notes\u201d) issued in November 2017 (the \u201cNovember Noteholders\u201d) have certain rights upon an event of default under their respective agreements that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and could require us to curtail or cease our operations.\nPayplant, the Debenture Holders, and the November Noteholders have certain rights upon an event of default. With respect to Payplant, such rights include an increase in the interest rate on any advances made pursuant to the Payplant Loan Agreement, the right to accelerate the payment of any outstanding advances made pursuant to the Payplant Loan Agreement, the right to directly receive payments made by account debtors and the right to foreclose on our assets, among other rights. The Payplant Loan Agreement includes in its definition of an event of default, among other occurrences, the failure to pay any principal when due within two business days, the termination, winding up, liquidation or dissolution of any borrower, the filing of a tax lien by a governmental agency against any borrower, and any reduction in ownership of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Inpixon USA and Inpixon Federal.\nWith respect to the Debenture Holders, such rights include the right to accelerate all amounts outstanding under the Debenture and demand a mandatory default payment in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the outstanding principal amount of the Debenture, plus all accrued and unpaid interest, divided by the conversion price on the date the mandatory default amount is either (A) demanded (if demand or notice is required to create an event of default) or otherwise due or (B) paid in full, whichever has a lower conversion price, multiplied by the VWAP (as defined in the Debenture) on the date the mandatory default amount is either (x) demanded or otherwise due or (y) paid in full, whichever has a higher VWAP, or (ii) 125% of the outstanding principal amount plus 100% of accrued and unpaid interest, and (b) all other amounts, costs, expenses and liquidated damages due in respect of the Debenture. Each of the following events shall constitute an event of default: failure to make a payment obligation, failure to observe certain covenants of the Debenture or related agreements (subject to applicable cure periods), breach of representation or warranty, bankruptcy, default under another significant contract or credit obligation, delisting of the common stock, a change in control, or failure to deliver stock certificates in a timely manner.\nThe November Holders have the right to accelerate all amounts outstanding under the November 2017 Notes payable in cash in an amount equal to the greater of (a) the outstanding balance divided by $13.50 (subject to adjustment as set forth in the November 2017 Notes) on the date the note is demanded, multiplied by the VWAP on such date, or (b) the outstanding balance following multiplying the outstanding balance as of the date the applicable default occurred by (a) 15% for each occurrence of any Major Default (as defined in the November 2017 Notes), or (b) 5% for each occurrence of any Minor Default (as defined in the November 2017 Notes), and then adding the resulting product to the outstanding balance as of the date the applicable default occurred, with the sum of the foregoing then becoming the outstanding balance under the November 2017 Notes as of the date the applicable default occurred; provided that the Default Effect (as defined in the November 2017 Notes) may only be applied three (3) times with respect to Major Defaults and three (3) times with respect to Minor Defaults; and provided further that the Default Effect shall not apply to any default pursuant to Section 4.1(b) of the November 2017 Notes. Each of the following events shall constitute an event of default: failure to pay any principal, interest, fees, charges, or any other amount when due and payable under the November 2017 Notes; (b) failure to deliver any Lender Conversion Shares (as defined in the November 2017 Notes); (c) failure to deliver any Redemption Conversion Shares (as defined below); (d) a receiver, trustee or other similar official shall be appointed over the Company or a material part of its assets and such appointment shall remain uncontested for twenty (20) days or shall not be dismissed or discharged within sixty (60) days; (e) Company becomes insolvent or generally fails to pay, or admits in writing its inability to pay, its debts as they become due, subject to applicable grace periods, if any; (f) Company makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (g) Company files a petition for relief under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law (domestic or foreign); (h) an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding is commenced or filed against Company; (i) Company defaults or otherwise fails to observe or perform any covenant, obligation, condition or agreement of the Company, with certain limitations; (j) any representation, warranty or other statement made or furnished by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the issuance of the November 2017 Notes is false, incorrect, incomplete or misleading in any material respect when made or furnished; (k) the occurrence of a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the November 2017 Notes) without lender\u2019s prior written consent; (l) the Company fails to maintain the Share Reserve (as defined in the November 2017 Notes); (m) the Company effectuates a reverse split of its common stock without twenty (20) trading days prior written notice to lender; (n) any money judgment, writ or similar process is entered or filed against the Company or any subsidiary or any of its property or other assets for more than $600,000.00, and shall remain unvacated, unbonded or unstayed for a period of twenty (20) calendar days unless otherwise consented to by lender; (o) the Company fails to be DWAC eligible; (p) the Company fails to observe or perform any covenant set forth in the purchase agreement; and (q) the Company breaches any covenant or other term or condition contained in any Other Agreements (as defined in the November 2017 Notes).\nThe exercise of any of these rights upon an event of default could substantially harm our financial condition and force us to curtail, or even to cease, our operations.\nIf we are unable to comply with certain financial and operating restrictions required by the Payplant Loan Agreement, we may be limited in our business activities and access to credit or may default under the Payplant Loan Agreement.\nProvisions in the Payplant Loan Agreement impose restrictions or require prior approval on our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u25cf sell, lease, transfer, convey, or otherwise dispose of any or all of our assets or collateral, except in the ordinary course of business;\n\u25cf make any loans to any person, as that term is defined in the Payplant Loan Agreement, with the exception of employee loans made in the ordinary course of business;\n\u25cf declare or pay cash dividends, make any distribution on, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly, any of our Equity Interests, as defined in the Payplant Loan Agreement;\n\u25cf guarantee the indebtedness of any Person;\n\u25cf compromise, settle or adjust any claims in any amount relating to any of the collateral;\n\u25cf incur, create or permit to exist any lien on any of our property or assets;\n\u25cf engage in new lines of business;\n\u25cf change, alter or modify, or permit any change, alteration or modification of our organizational documents in any manner that might adversely affect Payplant\u2019s rights;\n\u25cf sell, assign, transfer, discount or otherwise dispose of any accounts or any promissory note payable to us, with or without recourse;\n\u25cf incur, create, assume, or permit to exist, any indebtedness or liability on account of either borrowed money or the deferred purchase price of property; and\n\u25cf make any payments of cash or other property to any affiliate.\nThe Payplant Loan Agreement also contains other customary covenants. We may not be able to comply with these covenants in the future. Our failure to comply with these covenants may result in the declaration of an event of default and cause us to be unable to borrow under the Payplant Loan Agreement. In addition to preventing additional borrowings under the Payplant Loan Agreement, an event of default, if not cured or waived, may result in the acceleration of the maturity of indebtedness outstanding under the Payplant Loan Agreement, which would require us to pay all amounts outstanding. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available for repayment or we may not have the ability to borrow or obtain sufficient funds to replace the accelerated indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our failure to repay the indebtedness would result in Payplant foreclosing on all or a portion of our assets and force us to curtail, or even to cease, our operations.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that the Company or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nUpon completion of any acquisitions by the Company, we may be subject to claims that our acquired companies and their employees may have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of former employers or competitors. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying money claims, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key research personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize certain products, which could severely harm our business.\nAdverse judgments or settlements in legal proceedings could materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe are currently subject to pending claims for non-payment by certain vendors in an aggregate amount of approximately $5.4 million, which is approximately 20% of our total assets as of December 31, 2017. In addition, as of the date of this annual report we have received a notice to cure in connection with the failure to pay charges of approximately $154,000 in connection with certain property lease agreements. We may also be a party to other claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, which may include those related to, for example, contracts, sub-contracts, protection of confidential information or trade secrets, adversary proceedings arising from customer bankruptcies, employment of our workforce and immigration requirements or compliance with any of a wide array of state and federal statutes, rules and regulations that pertain to different aspects of our business. We may also be required to initiate expensive litigation or other proceedings to protect our business interests. There is a risk that we will not be successful or otherwise be able to satisfactorily resolve any pending or future litigation. In addition, litigation and other legal claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of currently pending legal matters may change in the future. Those uncertainties include, but are not limited to, litigation costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, unpredictable judicial or jury decisions and the differing laws and judicial proclivities regarding damage awards among the states in which we operate. Unexpected outcomes in such legal proceedings, or changes in management\u2019s evaluation or predictions of the likely outcomes of such proceedings (possibly resulting in changes in established reserves), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Due to recurring losses and net capital deficiency, our current financial status may increase our default and litigation risks and may make us more financially vulnerable in the face of pending or threatened litigation.\nThe loss of our Chief Executive Officer or other key personnel may adversely affect our operations.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends to a significant extent upon the operation, experience, and continued services of certain of its officers, including our CEO, as well as other key personnel. While our CEO and key personnel are employed under employment contracts, there is no assurance we will be able to retain their services. The loss of our CEO or several of the other key personnel could have an adverse effect on the Company. If our CEO or other executive officers were to leave we would face substantial difficulty in hiring a qualified successor and could experience a loss in productivity while any successor obtains the necessary training and experience. Furthermore, we do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on the lives of any executive officer and their death or incapacity would have a material adverse effect on us. The competition for qualified personnel is intense, and the loss of services of certain key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nInternal system or service failures could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our customers, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nAny system or service disruptions, on our hosted Cloud infrastructure or those caused by ongoing projects to improve our information technology systems and the delivery of services, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business including, among other things, an adverse effect on our ability to bill our customers for work performed on our contracts, collect the amounts that have been billed and produce accurate financial statements in a timely manner. We are also subject to systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, cyber security threats, natural disasters, power shortages, terrorist attacks or other events, which could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business, cause us to incur remediation costs, subject us to claims and damage our reputation. In addition, the failure or disruption of our communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our future results could be adversely affected.\nCustomer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nMany of the systems and networks that we develop, install and maintain for our customers on premise or host on our infrastructure involve managing and protecting personal information and information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions. While we have programs designed to comply with relevant privacy and security laws and restrictions, if a system or network that we develop, install or maintain were to fail or experience a security breach or service interruption, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, cyber security threats or other events, we may experience loss of revenue, remediation costs or face claims for damages or contract termination. Any such event could cause serious harm to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such systems and networks. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all of the damages that we may incur and, as a result, our future results could be adversely affected.\nOur financial performance could be adversely affected by decreases in spending on technology products and services by our public sector customers.\nOur sales to our public sector customers are impacted by government spending policies, budget priorities and revenue levels. Although our sales to federal, state and local government are diversified across multiple agencies and departments, they collectively accounted for approximately 37% and 13% of 2017 and 2016 net sales, respectively. An adverse change in government spending policies (including budget cuts at the federal level), budget priorities or revenue levels could cause our public sector customers to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew their contracts with us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the loss of certain vendor partner relationships and the availability of their products.\nWe purchase products for resale from vendor partners, which include OEMs, software publishers, and wholesale distributors. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 75% of our revenue was from purchases from vendor partners as defined above. We are authorized by vendor partners to sell all or some of their products via direct marketing activities. Our authorization with each vendor partner is subject to specific terms and conditions regarding such things as sales channel restrictions, product return privileges, price protection policies and purchase discounts. In the event we were to lose one of our significant vendor partners, our business could be adversely affected. If we complete the sale or spin-off of our VAR Business, as further described herein, we anticipate that our revenues levels will decrease by approximately 90% of our historical revenue levels.\nWe have entered, and expect to continue to enter, into joint venture, teaming and other arrangements, and these activities involve risks and uncertainties. A failure of any such relationship could have material adverse results on our business and results of operations.\nWe have entered, and expect to continue to enter, into joint venture, teaming and other arrangements. These activities involve risks and uncertainties, including the risk of the joint venture or applicable entity failing to satisfy its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments, the challenges in achieving strategic objectives and expected benefits of the business arrangement, the risk of conflicts arising between us and our partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts, and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements. A failure of our business relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business and operations expose us to numerous legal and regulatory requirements and any violation of these requirements could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and foreign legal requirements on matters as diverse as data privacy and protection, employment and labor relations, immigration, taxation, anticorruption, import/export controls, trade restrictions, internal control and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation and anti-competition. Compliance with diverse and changing legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. We are also focused on expanding our business in certain identified growth areas, such as health information technology, energy and environment, which are highly regulated and may expose us to increased compliance risk. Violations of one or more of these diverse legal requirements in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines and other damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations or contractual obligations related to regulatory compliance in connection with the performance of customer contracts could also result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to compete for certain work and allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations.\nIf we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights, we may experience a loss of revenue and our operations and growth prospects may be materially harmed.\nWe have not registered copyrights on any of the software we have developed. We rely upon confidentiality agreements signed by our employees, consultants and third parties to protect our intellectual property. We cannot assure you that we can adequately protect our intellectual property or successfully prosecute actual or potential infringement of our intellectual property rights. Also, we cannot assure you that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in a loss of revenue and could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur proprietary software is protected by common law copyright laws, as opposed to registration under copyright statutes. We have not registered copyrights on any of the software we have developed. Our performance and ability to compete are dependent to a significant degree on our proprietary technology. Our proprietary software is protected by common law copyright laws, as opposed to registration under copyright statutes. Common law protection may be narrower than that which we could obtain under registered copyrights. As a result, we may experience difficulty in enforcing our copyrights against certain third party infringements. As part of our confidentiality-protection procedures, we generally enter into agreements with our employees and consultants and limit access to, and distribution of, our software, documentation and other proprietary information. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology or that agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable. The laws of other countries may afford us little or no protection of our intellectual property. We also rely on a variety of technology that we license from third parties. There can be no assurance that these third party technology licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The loss of or inability to maintain or obtain upgrades to any of these technology licenses could result in delays in completing software enhancements and new development until equivalent technology could be identified, licensed or developed and integrated. Any such delays would materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe growth of our business is dependent on increasing sales to our existing clients and obtaining new clients, which, if unsuccessful, could limit our financial performance.\nOur ability to increase revenues from existing clients by identifying additional opportunities to sell more of our products and services and our ability to obtain new clients depends on a number of factors, including our ability to offer high quality products and services at competitive prices, the strength of our competitors and the capabilities of our sales and marketing departments. If we are not able to continue to increase sales of our products and services to existing clients or to obtain new clients in the future, we may not be able to increase our revenues and could suffer a decrease in revenues as well.\nOur business depends on the continued growth of the market for IT products and services, which is uncertain.\nThe storage and computing and professional services segments of our business include IT products and services solutions that are designed to address the growing markets for on and off-premises services (including migrations, consolidations, Cloud computing and disaster recovery), technology integration services (including storage and data protection services and the implementation of virtualization solutions) and managed services (including operational support and client support). These markets are continuously changing. Competing technologies and services, reduction in technology refreshes or reductions in corporate spending may reduce the demand for our products and services.\nDecreases, or slow growth, in the newspaper publishing industry may negatively impact our results from operation as it relates to our Cloud based applications and analytics for media and publishing.\nThe newspaper industry as a whole is experiencing challenges to maintain and grow print circulation and revenues. This results from, among other factors, increased competition from other media, particularly the growth of electronic media, and shifting preferences among some consumers to receive all or a portion of their news other than from a newspaper. The customer base for our Cloud based applications and analytics for media and publishing is focused on the newspaper publishing industry and therefore sales from this operating sector will be subject to the future of the newspaper industry.\nOur competitiveness depends significantly on our ability to keep pace with the rapid changes in IT. Failure by us to anticipate and meet our clients\u2019 technological needs could adversely affect our competitiveness and growth prospects.\nWe operate and compete in an industry characterized by rapid technological innovation, changing client needs, evolving industry standards and frequent introductions of new products, product enhancements, services and distribution methods. Our success depends on our ability to develop expertise with these new products, product enhancements, services and distribution methods and to implement IT solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid changes in technology, the IT industry, and client needs. The introduction of new products, product enhancements and distribution methods could decrease demand for current products or render them obsolete. Sales of products and services can be dependent on demand for specific product categories, and any change in demand for or supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on our net sales if we fail to adapt to such changes in a timely manner.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and we may be required to reduce the prices for some of our products and services to remain competitive, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur industry is developing rapidly and related technology trends are constantly evolving. In this environment, we face significant price competition from our competitors. We may be unable to offset the effect of declining average sales prices through increased sales volumes and/or reductions in our costs. Furthermore, we may be forced to reduce the prices of the products and services we sell in response to offerings made by our competitors. Finally, we may not be able to maintain the level of bargaining power that we have enjoyed in the past when negotiating the prices of our services.\nWe face substantial competition from other national, multi-regional, regional and local value-added resellers and IT service providers, some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do or that may have more fully developed business relationships with clients or prospective clients than we do. Many of our competitors compete principally on the basis of price and may have lower costs or accept lower selling prices than we do and, therefore, we may need to reduce our prices. In addition, manufacturers may choose to market their products directly to end-users, rather than through IT solutions providers such as us, and this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur profitability is dependent on the rates we are able to charge for our products and services. The rates we are able to charge for our products and services are affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf our clients\u2019 perceptions of our ability to add value through our services;\n\u25cf introduction of new services or products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf our competitors\u2019 pricing policies;\n\u25cf our ability to charge higher prices where market demand or the value of our services justifies it;\n\u25cf procurement practices of our clients; and\n\u25cf general economic and political conditions.\nIf we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our products and services, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSales of our IT products and services are subject to quarterly and seasonal variations that may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results, therefore period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be reliable predictors of future performance.\nThe timing of our revenues can be difficult to predict. Our sales efforts involve educating our clients about the use and benefit of the products we sell and our services and solutions, including their technical capabilities and potential cost savings to an organization. Clients typically undertake a significant evaluation process that has in the past resulted in a lengthy sales cycle, which typically lasts several months, and may last a year or longer. We spend substantial time, effort and money on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales during a given period.\nIn addition, many of our clients spend a substantial portion of their IT budgets in the second half of the year. Other factors that may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate include changes in general economic conditions and the impact of unforeseen events. We believe that our revenues will continue to be affected in the future by cyclical trends. As a result, you may not be able to rely on period-to-period comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance.\nA delay in the completion of our clients\u2019 budget processes could delay purchases of our products and services and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on our clients to purchase products and services from us to maintain and increase our earnings, and client purchases are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. If sales expected from a specific client are not realized when anticipated or at all, our results could fall short of public expectations and our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe profit margins from our IT products and services depend, in part, on the volume of products and services sold. A failure to achieve increases in our profit margins in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGiven the significant levels of competition that characterize the IT reseller market, it is unlikely that we will be able to increase gross profit margins through increases in sales of IT products alone. Any increase in gross profit margins from this operating sector, if we choose to continue this sector, will depend, in part, on the growth of our higher margin businesses such as IT consulting and professional services. In addition, low margins increase the sensitivity of our results of operations to increases in costs of financing. Any failure by us to maintain or increase our gross profit margins could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failures or interruptions in our services or systems could damage our reputation and substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to provide reliable remote services, technology integration and managed services to our clients. The operations of our IT products and services as well as our Cloud based applications and analytics are susceptible to damage or interruption from human error, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks and similar events. We could also experience failures or interruptions of our systems and services, or other problems in connection with our operations, as a result of:\n\u25cf damage to or failure of our computer software or hardware or our connections;\n\u25cf errors in the processing of data by our systems;\n\u25cf computer viruses or software defects;\n\u25cf physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events;\n\u25cf increased capacity demands or changes in systems requirements of our clients; and\n\u25cf errors by our employees or third-party service providers.\nOur inventory management systems and related supply chain tools may not be able to forecast accurately and effectively manage supply of our products. If we ultimately determine that we have excess supply, we may have to reduce our prices and write-down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins. If actual component usage and product demand are lower than the forecast, losses on manufacturing commitments in excess of forecasted demand may be accrued.\nAny production interruptions for any reason, such as a natural disaster, epidemic, capacity shortages, or quality problems, at one of our manufacturing partners would negatively affect sales of product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAny interruptions in our systems or services could damage our reputation and substantially harm our business and results of operations. While we maintain disaster recovery plans and insurance with coverage we believe to be adequate, claims may exceed insurance coverage limits, may not be covered by insurance or insurance may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nSome of our services and solutions involve storing and replicating mission-critical data for our clients and are highly technical in nature. If client data is lost or corrupted, our reputation and business could be harmed.\nOur IT data center and technology integration services and Software-as-a-Service solutions include storing and replicating mission-critical data for our clients. The process of storing and replicating that data within their data centers or at our facilities is highly technical and complex. If any data is lost or corrupted in connection with the use of our products and services, our reputation could be seriously harmed and market acceptance of our IT solutions could suffer. In addition, our solutions have contained, and may in the future contain, undetected errors, defects or security vulnerabilities. Some errors in our solutions may only be discovered after a solution has been in use by clients. Any errors, defects or security vulnerabilities discovered in our solutions after use by clients could result in loss of revenues, loss of clients, increased service and warranty cost and diversion of attention of our management and technical personnel, any of which could significantly harm our business. In addition, we could face claims for product liability, tort or breach of warranty. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of us and our service offerings and solutions.\nWe do not have long-term recurring revenue generating contracts with our clients that utilize our IT products and services, and such clients may cease providing new purchase orders at any time or reduce the amount of purchases they make that would depress the revenues we receive from our IT products and services and harm our results of operations.\nOur operations depend upon our relationships with our clients. Revenues from out IT products and services are typically driven by purchase orders received every month. The majority of revenues from our IT products and services come from one time purchase orders that do not guarantee any future recurring revenues. Approximately 24% of such revenues are recurring and based on contracts that range from 1-5 years for warranty and maintenance support. For these contracts the customer is invoiced one time and pays up front for the full term of the warranty and maintenance contract. Revenue from these contracts is determinable ratably over the contract period with the unearned revenue recorded as deferred revenue and amortized over the contract period. Clients with these types of contracts may cease providing new purchase orders at any time, may elect not to renew such contracts, cancel and request a refund of maintenance/warranty services that have not yet been provided (upon 30 days advance written notice) or reschedule purchases. If clients cease providing us with new purchase orders, diminish the services purchased from us, cancel executed purchase orders or delay future purchase orders, revenues received from the sale of our IT products and services would be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. There is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or generate future revenue from our existing clients or develop relationships with new clients.\nWe rely on a limited number of key customers, the importance of which may vary dramatically from year to year, and a loss of one or more of these key customers may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur top three customers accounted for approximately 26% and 40% of our gross revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. One customer accounted for 28% of our gross revenue in 2016, was a significant contributor in 2017 however this customer may or may not continue to be a significant contributor to revenue in 2018. The loss of a significant amount of business from one of our major customers would materially and adversely affect our results of operations until such time, if ever, as we are able to replace the lost business. Significant clients or projects in any one period may not continue to be significant clients or projects in other periods. To the extent that we are dependent on any single customer, we are subject to the risks faced by that customer to the extent that such risks impede the customer\u2019s ability to stay in business and make timely payments to us.\nConsolidation in the industries that we serve or from which we purchase could adversely affect our business.\nSome of the clients we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale by combining with or acquiring other companies. If two or more of our current clients combine their operations, it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients. If one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting, systems integration and technology, or outsourcing services, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work. If two or more of our suppliers merge or consolidate operations, the increased market power of the larger company could also increase our product costs and place competitive pressures on us. Any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business.\nThe loss of any key manufacturer or distributor relationships, or related industry certifications, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAs part of our end-to-end IT solutions, we are authorized resellers of the products and services of leading IT manufacturers and distributors. In many cases, we have achieved the highest level of relationship the manufacturer or distributor offers. In addition, our employees hold certifications issued by these manufacturers and by industry associations relating to the configuration, installation and servicing of these products. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by the range of manufacturers and distributors we represent, the relationship level we have achieved with these manufacturers and distributors and the scope of the manufacturer and industry certifications our employees hold. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain these relationships with our manufacturers and distributors, that we will be able to retain the employees holding these manufacturer and industry certifications, or that our employees will maintain their manufacturer or industry certifications. The loss of any of these relationships or certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may experience a reduction in the incentive programs offered to us by our vendors. Any such reduction could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe receive payments and credits from vendors, including consideration pursuant to volume sales incentive programs and marketing development funding programs. These programs are usually of finite terms and may not be renewed or may be changed in a way that has an adverse effect on us. Vendor funding is used to offset, among other things, inventory costs, cost of goods sold, marketing costs and other operating expenses. Certain of these funds are based on our volume of net sales or purchases, growth rate of net sales or purchases and marketing programs. If we do not grow our net sales or if we are not in compliance with the terms of these programs, there could be a material negative effect on the amount of incentives offered or paid to us by vendors. No assurance can be given that we will continue to receive such incentives or that we will be able to collect outstanding amounts relating to these incentives in a timely manner, or at all. Any sizeable reduction in, the discontinuance of, or a significant delay in receiving or the inability to collect such incentives, particularly related to incentive programs with one of our largest partners, Hewlett-Packard Company, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to react timely to any fundamental changes in the programs of vendors, including the elimination of funding for some of the activities for which we have been compensated in the past, such changes would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may need additional cash financing and any failure to obtain cash financing, could limit our ability to grow our business and develop or enhance our service offerings to respond to market demand or competitive challenges.\nWe expect that we will need to raise funds in order to continue our operations and implement our plans to grow our business. However, if we decide to seek additional capital, we may be unable to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise the required cash, our ability to grow our business and develop or enhance our service offerings to respond to market demand or competitive challenges could be limited.\nWe rely on inventory financing and vendor credit arrangements for our daily working capital and certain operational functions, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our future results.\nWe rely on inventory financing and vendor financing arrangements for daily working capital and to fund equipment purchases for our technology sales business. The loss of any of our inventory financing or vendor credit financing arrangements, a reduction in the amount of credit granted to us by our vendors, or a change in any of the material terms of these arrangements could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and have a material adverse effect on our future results. These credit arrangements are discretionary on the part of our creditors and require the performance of certain operational covenants. There can be no assurance that we will continue to meet those covenants and failure to do so may limit availability of, or cause us to lose, such financing. There can be no assurance that such financing will continue to be available to us in the future on acceptable terms.\nIf we cannot collect our receivables or if payment is delayed, our business may be adversely affected by our inability to generate cash flow, provide working capital or continue our business operations.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for products received from us and any work performed by us. The timely collection of our receivables allows us to generate cash flow, provide working capital and continue our business operations. Our clients may fail to pay or delay the payment of invoices for a number of reasons, including financial difficulties resulting from macroeconomic conditions or lack of an approved budget. An extended delay or default in payment relating to a significant account will have a material and adverse effect on the aging schedule and turnover days of our accounts receivable. If we are unable to timely collect our receivables from our clients for any reason, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf our location based security and detection and context aware marketing products fail to satisfy customer demands or to achieve increased market acceptance our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nThe market acceptance of our products, particularly our location based security and detection and context aware marketing products are critical to our continued success. Demand for these products is affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including continued market acceptance, the timing of development and release of new products by competitors, technological change, and growth or decline in the mobile device management market. We expect the proliferation of mobile devices to lead to an increase in the data security demands of our customers, and our products may not be able to scale and perform to meet those demands. If we are unable to continue to meet customer demands or to achieve more widespread market acceptance of these products, our business operations, financial results and growth prospects will be materially and adversely affected.\nDefects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our location based security and detection products or services or the failure of such products or services to prevent a security breach, could harm our reputation and adversely impact our results of operations.\nBecause our location based security products and services are complex, they have contained and may contain design or manufacturing defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by customers. Defects may cause such products to be vulnerable to advanced persistent threats (APTs) or security attacks, cause them to fail to help secure information or temporarily interrupt customers\u2019 networking traffic. Because the techniques used by hackers to access sensitive information change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and provide a solution in time to protect customers\u2019 data. In addition, defects or errors in our subscription updates or products could result in a failure to effectively update customers\u2019 hardware products and thereby leave customers vulnerable to APTs or security attacks.\nAny defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our products could result in:\n\u25cf Expenditure of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work-around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities;\n\u25cf Delayed or lost revenue;\n\u25cf Loss of existing or potential customers or partners;\n\u25cf Increased warranty claims compared with historical experience, or increased cost of servicing warranty claims, either of which would adversely affect gross margins; and\n\u25cf Litigation, regulatory inquiries, or investigations that may be costly and harm our reputation\nOur Cloud strategy, including our Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Data as a Service (DaaS) offerings, may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe offer customers a full range of consumption models including the deployment of our products via our Cloud based SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and DaaS offerings. These business models continue to evolve, and we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our Cloud offerings. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of Cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our on-premises enterprise software offerings and our Cloud offerings, and has a dampening impact on overall demand for our on-premises software product and service offerings, which could reduce our revenues and profitability, at least in the near-term. If we do not successfully execute our Cloud computing strategy or anticipate the Cloud computing needs of our customers, our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline.\nOur Cloud offerings are generally purchased by customers on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably over the term of the subscriptions. The deferred revenue that results from sales of our Cloud offerings may prevent any deterioration in sales activity associated with our Cloud offerings from becoming immediately observable in our consolidated statement of operations. This is in contrast to revenues associated with our new software licenses arrangements whereby new software licenses revenues are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related software licenses. We incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructures and marketing of our Cloud offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings. As customer demand for our Cloud offerings increases, we experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our new software licenses arrangements and Cloud offering arrangements.\nOur current research and development efforts may not produce successful products or features that result in significant revenue, cost savings or other benefits in the near future. If we do not realize significant revenue from our research and development efforts, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nDeveloping products and related enhancements in our field is expensive. Investments in research and development may not result in significant design improvements, marketable products or features or may result in products that are more expensive than anticipated. We may not achieve the cost savings or the anticipated performance improvements expected, and we may take longer to generate revenue from products in development, or generate less revenue than expected.\nOur future plans include significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities. Our management believes that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain a competitive position. However, we may not receive significant revenue from these investments in the near future, or these investments may not yield the expected benefits, either of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nMisuse of our products could harm our reputation.\nOur products, particularly our location based security and detection and context aware marketing may be misused by customers or third parties that obtain access to such products. For example, these products could be used to protect information kept by criminals from government agencies. Such use of these products for censorship could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation.\nIf the general level of advanced attacks declines, or is perceived by current or potential customers to have declined, this could harm our location based security and detection operating segment, and our financial condition, operating results and growth prospects.\nOur location based security and detection operating segment is substantially dependent upon enterprises and governments recognizing that advanced persistent threats (\u201cAPTs\u201d) and other security attacks are pervasive and are not effectively prevented by legacy security solutions. High visibility attacks on prominent enterprises and governments have increased market awareness of the problem of APTs and security attacks and help to provide an impetus for enterprises and governments to devote resources to protecting against attacks, such as testing our platform, purchasing it, and broadly deploying it within their organizations. If APTs and other security attacks were to decline, or enterprises or governments perceived that the general level of attacks has declined, our ability to attract new customers and expand its offerings for existing customers could be materially and adversely affected, which would, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf our location based security and detection products do not effectively interoperate with our customers\u2019 IT infrastructure, installations could be delayed or cancelled, which would harm our financial condition, operating results and growth prospects.\nOur products must effectively interoperate with our customers\u2019 existing or future IT infrastructure, which often has different specifications, utilizes multiple protocol standards, deploys products from multiple vendors, and contains multiple generations of products that have been added over time. As a result, when problems occur in a company\u2019s infrastructure, it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers\u2019 infrastructure, we may have to modify its software or hardware so that our products will interoperate with the infrastructure of our customers. In such cases, our products may be unable to provide significant performance improvements for applications deployed in the infrastructure of our customers. These issues could cause longer installation times for our products and could cause order cancellations, either of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, other customers may require products to comply with certain security or other certifications and standards. If our products are late in achieving or fail to achieve compliance with these certifications and standards, or competitors sooner achieve compliance with these certifications and standards, we may be disqualified from selling our products to such customers, or may otherwise be at a competitive disadvantage, either of which would harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and growth prospects.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop under patent and other intellectual property laws of the United States so that we can prevent others from using our inventions and proprietary information. If we or our subsidiaries fail to protect intellectual property rights adequately, competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be adversely affected. However, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expenses. Any patents issued in the future may not provide us with any competitive advantages, and our patent applications may never be granted. The process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Even if issued, there can be no assurance that these patents will adequately protect our intellectual property, as the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of patent and other intellectual property rights are complex and often uncertain. Our inability to protect our property rights could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and growth prospects.\nWe depend on the U.S. government for a substantial portion of our business and government budget impasses together with changes in government defense spending could have adverse consequences on our financial position, results of operations and business.\nA substantial portion of our U.S. revenues from our operations have been from and will continue to be from sales and services rendered directly or indirectly to the U.S. Government. Consequently, our revenues are highly dependent on the Government\u2019s demand for computer systems and related services. Our revenues from the U.S. Government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various U.S. Government programs, primarily defense-related programs with the Department of Defense (DoD), as well as a broad range of programs with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Bureau of Prisons, National Institute of Health (NIH), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Department of Homeland Security, the Intelligence Community and other departments and agencies. Cost cutting including through consolidation and elimination of duplicative organizations and insurance has become a major initiative for DoD. The funding of our programs is subject to the overall U.S. Government budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events and macroeconomic conditions. It is expected that U.S. Government spending on IT will decrease from 6% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) during the first decade of the 21st Century to 3%. (Source: Market Research Media - U.S. Federal IT Market Forecast 2013-2018). The overall level of U.S. defense spending increased in recent years for numerous reasons, including increases in funding of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, with the winding down of both wars, defense spending levels are becoming increasingly difficult to predict and are expected to be affected by numerous factors. Such factors include priorities of the Administration and the Congress, and the overall health of the U.S. and world economies and the state of governmental finances.\nThe Budget Control Act of 2011 enacted 10-year discretionary spending caps which are expected to generate over $1 trillion in savings for the U.S. Government, a substantial portion of which comes from DoD baseline spending reductions. In addition, the Budget Control Act of 2011 provides for additional automatic spending cuts (referred to as \u201csequestration\u201d) totaling $1.2 trillion over nine years which were implemented beginning in the U.S. Government fiscal year ending September 30, 2013 (GFY13). These reduction targets will further reduce DoD and other federal agency budgets. Although the Office of Management and Budget has provided guidance to agencies on implementing sequestration cuts, there remains much uncertainty about how exactly sequestration cuts will be implemented and the impact those cuts will have on contractors supporting the government. We are not able to predict the impact of future budget cuts, including sequestration, on our Company or our financial results. However, we expect that budgetary constraints and concerns related to the national debt will continue to place downward pressure on DoD spending levels and that implementation of the automatic spending cuts without change will reduce, delay or cancel funding for certain of our contracts - particularly those with unobligated balances - and programs and could adversely impact our operations, financial results and growth prospects.\nA significant reduction in defense spending could have long-term consequences for our size and structure. In addition, reduction in government priorities and requirements could impact the funding, or the timing of funding, of our programs, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we are involved in U.S. Government programs which are classified by the U.S. Government and our ability to discuss these programs, including any risks and disputes and claims associated with and our performance under such programs, could be limited due to applicable security restrictions.\nThe U.S. government systems integration business is intensely competitive and we may not be able to win government bids when competing against much larger companies, which could reduce our revenues.\nLarge computer systems integration contracts awarded by the U.S. Government are few in number and are awarded through a formal competitive bidding process, including indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ), GSA Schedule and other multi-award contracts. Bids are awarded on the basis of price, compliance with technical bidding specifications, technical expertise and, in some cases, demonstrated management ability to perform the contract. There can be no assurance that the Company will win and/or fulfill additional contracts. Moreover, the award of these contracts is subject to protest procedures and there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in any ensuing legal protest. The Company\u2019s failure to secure a significant dollar volume of U.S. Government contracts in the future would adversely affect our Inpixon Federal subsidiary.\nThe U.S. Government systems integration business is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. The Company competes with a large number of systems integrators, hardware and software manufacturers, and other large and diverse companies attempting to enter or expand their presence in the U.S. Government market. Many of the existing and potential competitors have greater financial, operating and technological resources than the Company. The competitive environment may require us to make changes in our pricing, services or marketing. The competitive bidding process involves substantial costs and a number of risks, including significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us, or that may be awarded, but for which we do not receive meaningful revenues. Accordingly, our success depends on our ability to develop services and products that address changing needs and to provide people and technology needed to deliver these services and products. To remain competitive, we must consistently provide superior service, technology and performance on a cost-effective basis to our customers. Our response to competition could cause us to expend significant financial and other resources, disrupt our operations and strain relationships with partners, any of which could harm our business and/or financial condition.\nInpixon Federal\u2019s financial performance is dependent on our ability to perform on our U.S. government contracts, which are subject to termination for convenience, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nInpixon Federal\u2019s financial performance is dependent on our performance under our U.S. Government contracts. With the Integrio acquisition the Company\u2019s government contract revenue has increased significantly and represents approximately 67% of its revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017. Government customers have the right to cancel any contract at their convenience. An unanticipated termination of, or reduced purchases under, one of the Company\u2019s major contracts whether due to lack of funding, for convenience or otherwise, or the occurrence of delays, cost overruns and product failures could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. If one of our contracts were terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If one of our contracts were terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for our work that has been accepted by the government. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. Furthermore, on contracts for which we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, irrespective of our performance as a subcontractor. The termination or cancellation of U.S. Government contracts, no matter what the reason, could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to comply with a variety of complex procurement rules and regulations could result in our being liable for penalties, including termination of our U.S. government contracts, disqualification from bidding on future U.S. government contracts and suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting that could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts, which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business. U.S. Government contracts generally are subject to: (i) the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. Government; (ii) department-specific regulations that implement or supplement FAR, such as the DoD\u2019s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS); and (iii) other applicable laws and regulations. We are also subject to the Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations; the Procurement Integrity Act, which regulates access to competitor bid and proposal information and government source selection information, and our ability to provide compensation to certain former government officials; the Civil False Claims Act, which provides for substantial civil penalties for violations, including for submission of a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. Government for payment or approval; and the U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. Government contracts. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, and audit requirements. A contractor\u2019s failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions to the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines and lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. In addition, government contractors are also subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. Government agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). These agencies review a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The DCAA also reviews the adequacy of and a contractor\u2019s compliance with its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor\u2019s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. During the term of any suspension or debarment by any U.S. Government agency, contractors can be prohibited from competing for or being awarded contracts by U.S. Government agencies. The termination of any of the Company\u2019s significant government contracts or the imposition of fines, damages, suspensions or debarment would adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial condition.\nThe U.S. government may adopt new contract rules and regulations or revise its procurement practices in a manner adverse to us at any time.\nOur industry has experienced, and we expect it will continue to experience, significant changes to business practices as a result of an increased focus on affordability, efficiencies, and recovery of costs, among other items. U.S. Government agencies may face restrictions or pressure regarding the type and amount of services that they may obtain from private contractors. Legislation, regulations and initiatives dealing with procurement reform, mitigation of potential conflicts of interest and environmental responsibility or sustainability, as well as any resulting shifts in the buying practices of U.S. Government agencies, such as increased usage of fixed price contracts, multiple award contracts and small business set-aside contracts, could have adverse effects on government contractors, including us. Any of these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or renew our existing contracts when those contracts expire and are subject to a renewed bidding process. Any new contracting requirements or procurement methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement and could adversely affect our future revenues, profitability and prospects.\nWe may incur cost overruns as a result of fixed priced government contracts, which would have a negative impact on our operations.\nMost of our U.S. Government contracts are multi-award, multi-year IDIQ task order based contracts, which generally provide for fixed price schedules for products and services, have no pre-set delivery schedules, have very low minimum purchase requirements, are typically competed over among multiple awardees and force us to carry the burden of any cost overruns. Due to their nature, fixed-priced contracts inherently have more risk than cost reimbursable contracts. If we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, we can lose money on these contracts. In addition, some of our contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights, and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts, we may not realize their full benefits. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns and cost controls would have a negative impact on our results of operations. The U.S. Government has the right to enter into contract with other suppliers, which may be competitive with the Company\u2019s IDIQ contracts. The Company also performs fixed priced contracts under which the Company agrees to provide specific quantities of products and services over time for a fixed price. Since the price competition to win both IDIQ and fixed price contracts is intense and the costs of future contract performance cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance as to the profits, if any, that the Company will realize over the term of such contracts.\nMisconduct of employees, subcontractors, agents and business partners could cause us to lose existing contracts or customers and adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts and customers and could have a significant adverse impact on our business and reputation.\nMisconduct could include fraud or other improper activities such as falsifying time or other records and violations of laws, including the Anti-Kickback Act. Other examples could include the failure to comply with our policies and procedures or with federal, state or local government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the use and safeguarding of classified or other protected information, legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, laws and regulations relating to environmental, health or safety matters, bribery of foreign government officials, import-export control, lobbying or similar activities, and any other applicable laws or regulations. Any data loss or information security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use or disclosure of sensitive or classified information could result in claims, remediation costs, regulatory sanctions against us, loss of current and future contracts and serious harm to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities, these precautions may not prevent all misconduct, and as a result, we could face unknown risks or losses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or misconduct by any of our employees, subcontractors, agents or business partners could damage our reputation and subject us to fines and penalties, restitution or other damages, loss of security clearance, loss of current and future customer contracts and suspension or debarment from contracting with federal, state or local government agencies, any of which would adversely affect our business, reputation and our future results.\nWe may fail to obtain and maintain necessary security clearances, which may adversely affect our ability to perform on certain U.S. government contracts and depress our potential revenues.\nMany U.S. Government programs require contractors to have security clearances. Depending on the level of required clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees are unable to obtain or retain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business, and our existing clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we are not able to obtain and maintain facility security clearances or engage employees with the required security clearances for a particular contract, we may not be able to bid on or win new contracts, or effectively rebid on expiring contracts, as well as lose existing contracts, which may adversely affect our operating results and inhibit the execution of our growth strategy.\nOur future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected by our dependence on other contractors.\nIf other contractors with whom we have contractual relationships either as a prime contractor or subcontractor eliminate or reduce their work with us, or if the U.S. Government terminates or reduces these other contractors\u2019 programs, does not award them new contracts or refuses to pay under a contract our financial and business condition may be adversely affected. Companies that do not have access to U.S. Government contracts may perform services as our subcontractor and that exposure could enhance such companies\u2019 prospect of securing a future position as a prime U.S. Government contractor which could increase competition for future contracts and impair our ability to perform on contracts.\nWe may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontractor, our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract, our hiring of a subcontractor\u2019s personnel or the subcontractor\u2019s failure to comply with applicable law. Current uncertain economic conditions heighten the risk of financial stress of our subcontractors, which could adversely impact their ability to meet their contractual requirements to us. If any of our subcontractors fail to timely meet their contractual obligations or have regulatory compliance or other problems, our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor or higher tier subcontractor may be jeopardized. Significant losses could arise in future periods and subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in our termination for default. A termination for default could eliminate a revenue source, expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders, especially if the customer is an agency of the U.S. Government.\nOur international business exposes us to geo-political and economic factors, regulatory requirements and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries.\nOur foreign operations pose complex management, foreign currency, legal, tax and economic risks, which we may not adequately address. We have foreign operations in the Middle East which we are winding down. At the same time, we provide our products and services to customers worldwide and expect to do business in South Asia. These risks differ from and potentially may be greater than those associated with our domestic business.\nOur international business is sensitive to changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers and geo-political uncertainties, which may be driven by changes in threat environments and potentially volatile worldwide economic conditions, various regional and local economic and political factors, risks and uncertainties, as well as U.S. foreign policy. Our international sales are subject to U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (see below) and other export laws and regulations. Due to the nature of our products, we must first obtain licenses and authorizations from various U.S. Government agencies before we are permitted to sell our products outside of the U.S. We can give no assurance that we will continue to be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses or authorizations or that certain sales will not be prevented or delayed. Any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside of the U.S. could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur international sales are also subject to local government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices which may differ from U.S. Government regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, investments, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings, as well as to varying currency, geo-political and economic risks. Our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, manufacturing agreements or financial support obligations, known as offset obligations, and provide for penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. Our international contracts may also be subject to termination at the customer\u2019s convenience or for default based on performance, and may be subject to funding risks. We also are exposed to risks associated with using foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations and teaming with international subcontractors, partners and suppliers in connection with international programs. As a result of these factors, we could experience award and funding delays on international programs and could incur losses on such programs, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are also subject to a number of other risks including:\n\u25cf the absence in some jurisdictions of effective laws to protect our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting tax laws;\n\u25cf restrictions on movement of cash;\n\u25cf the burdens of complying with a variety of national and local laws;\n\u25cf political instability;\n\u25cf currency fluctuations;\n\u25cf longer payment cycles;\n\u25cf restrictions on the import and export of certain technologies;\n\u25cf price controls or restrictions on exchange of foreign currencies; and\n\u25cf trade barriers.\nOur international operations are subject to special U.S. government laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations to import-export control, which may expose us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nOur international operations are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations and deal with governmental customers in countries known to experience corruption, including certain countries in the Middle East and in the future, the Far East. Our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants or contractors that could be in violation of various laws including the FCPA, even though these parties are not always subject to our control. We are also subject to import-export control regulations restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products, services, and technical data, including requirements regarding any applicable licensing of our employees involved in such work.\nAs a U.S. defense contractor we are vulnerable to security threats and other disruptions that could negatively impact our business.\nAs a U.S. defense contractor, we face certain security threats, including threats to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information, and threats to physical security. These types of events could disrupt our operations, require significant management attention and resources, and could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We are continuously exposed to cyber-attacks and other security threats, including physical break-ins. Any electronic or physical break-in or other security breach or compromise may jeopardize security of information stored or transmitted through our information technology systems and networks. This could lead to disruptions in mission-critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and controls to protect against, detect and mitigate these threats, we face advanced and persistent attacks on our information systems and attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated. These attempts include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others, and may be perpetrated by well-funded organized crime or state sponsored efforts. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their occurrence or recurrence. We continue to invest in and improve our threat protection, detection and mitigation policies, procedures and controls. In addition, we work with other companies in the industry and government participants on increased awareness and enhanced protections against cyber security threats. However, because of the evolving nature and sophistication of these security threats, which can be difficult to detect, there can be no assurance that our policies, procedures and controls have or will detect or prevent any of these threats and we cannot predict the full impact of any such past or future incident. We may experience similar security threats to the information and technology systems that we develop, install or maintain under customer contracts. Although we work cooperatively with our customers and other business partners to seek to minimize the impacts of cyber and other security threats, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by those entities. Any remedial costs or other liabilities related to cyber or other security threats may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Occurrence of any of these security threats could expose us to claims, contract terminations and damages and could adversely affect our reputation, ability to work on sensitive U.S. Government contracts, business operations and financial results.\nDifficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations, and we do not expect these conditions to improve in the near future.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally, both in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world. Weak economic conditions generally, sustained uncertainty about global economic conditions, concerns about future U.S. government budget impasses or a prolonged or further tightening of credit markets could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows. Concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues and the availability of credit, in the U.S. have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward. These factors, combined with volatile oil prices and wavering business and consumer confidence, have precipitated an economic slowdown and a global recession. Domestic and international equity markets have been experiencing heightened volatility and turmoil. These events and the continuing market upheavals may have an adverse effect on our business. In the event of extreme prolonged market events, such as the global economic recovery, we could incur significant losses.\nThe Company intends to use open source blockchain technology in its IPA platform. This technology has been scrutinized by regulatory agencies and therefore we may be impacted by unfavorable regulatory action in one or more jurisdictions.\nThe Company intends to use open source blockchain technology as a secure repository for \u201cdevice reputation\u201d acquired by its IPA platform. Blockchain technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world. The Company could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions, including but not limited to restrictions on the use of blockchain technology, which could impede or limit the use of this technology within our product offerings.\nWe intend to use and leverage open source technology in our IPA platform which may create risks of security weaknesses.\nSome parts of our technology may be based on open-source technology, including the blockchain technology that we intend to use in our IPA platform, There is a risk that the development team, or other third parties may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructure elements of our technology solutions interfering with the use of such technology or causing loss to the Company.\nThe use of new and untested technologies, including blockchain technology, may result in risks that we may not be able to currently anticipate.\nBlockchain technology is a relatively new and untested technology. In addition to the risks set forth here, there are risks with the use of this technology that the Company cannot anticipate. Risks may further materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations from the risks set forth here.\nWe may not be able to develop new products or enhance our product to keep pace with our industry\u2019s rapidly changing technology and customer requirements.\nThe industry in which we operate is characterized by rapid technological changes, new product introductions, enhancements, and evolving industry standards. Our business prospects depend on our ability to develop new products and applications for our technology in new markets that develop as a result of technological and scientific advances, while improving performance and cost-effectiveness. New technologies, techniques or products could emerge that might offer better combinations of price and performance than the blockchain technology solutions that are being developed by the Company. It is important that we anticipate changes in technology and market demand. If we do not successfully innovate and introduce new technology into our anticipated technology solutions or effectively manage the transitions of our technology to new product offerings, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nWe are eligible to be treated as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which we refer to as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (3) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, as an emerging growth company, we are only required to provide two years of audited financial statements and two years of selected financial data in this annual report. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of any June 30 before that time or if we have total annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, in which cases we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31 or, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three-year period before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company immediately. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the later of our second annual report or the first annual report required to be filed with the Commission following the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls in the future.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends to our stockholders, so it is unlikely that stockholders will receive any return on their investment in our Company prior to selling stock in the Company.\nWe have never paid any dividends to our common stockholders as a public company. We currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and, therefore, do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. If we determine that we will pay cash dividends to the holders of our common stock, we cannot assure that such cash dividends will be paid on a timely basis. The success of your investment in the Company will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation. As a result, you will not receive any return on your investment prior to selling your shares in our Company and, for the other reasons discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, you may not receive any return on your investment even when you sell your shares in our Company.\nAnti-Takeover, Limited Liability and Indemnification Provisions\nSome provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may deter takeover attempts, which may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and limit the opportunity of our stockholders to sell their shares at a favorable price.\nUnder our articles of incorporation, our Board of Directors may issue additional shares of common or preferred stock. Our Board of Directors has the ability to authorize \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without future shareholder approval. This makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, including a transaction in which our stockholders would receive a premium over the market price for their shares and/or any other transaction that might otherwise be deemed to be in their best interests, and thereby protects the continuity of our management and limits an investor\u2019s opportunity to profit by their investment in the Company. Specifically, if in the due exercise of its fiduciary obligations, the Board of Directors were to determine that a takeover proposal was not in our best interest, shares could be issued by our Board of Directors without stockholder approval in one or more transactions that might prevent or render more difficult or costly the completion of the takeover by:\n\u25cf diluting the voting or other rights of the proposed acquirer or insurgent stockholder group,\n\u25cf putting a substantial voting bloc in institutional or other hands that might undertake to support the incumbent Board of Directors, or\n\u25cf effecting an acquisition that might complicate or preclude the takeover.\nNevada Anti-Takeover Law may discourage acquirers and eliminate a potentially beneficial sale for our stockholders.\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section 78.438 of the Nevada Revised Statutes concerning corporate takeovers. This section prevents many Nevada corporations from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder, under specified circumstances. For these purposes, a business combination includes a merger or sale of more than 5% of our assets, and an interested stockholder includes a stockholder who owns 10% or more of our outstanding voting stock, as well as affiliates and associates of these persons. Under these provisions, this type of business combination is prohibited for three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder unless:\n\u25cf the transaction in which the stockholder became an interested stockholder is approved by the Board of Directors prior to the date the interested stockholder attained that status;\n\u25cf on consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder\u2019s becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 90% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction was commenced, excluding those shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers; or\n\u25cf on or subsequent to that date, the business combination is approved by the Board of Directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.\nThis statute could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts and, accordingly, may discourage attempts to acquire us.\nOur indemnification of our officers and directors may cause us to use corporate resources to the detriment of our stockholders.\nOur articles of incorporation eliminate the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages arising from a breach of their fiduciary duty as directors to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada law. This limitation does not affect the availability of equitable remedies, such as injunctive relief or rescission. Our articles of incorporation require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada law, including in circumstances in which indemnification is otherwise discretionary under Nevada law.\nUnder Nevada law, we may indemnify our directors or officers or other persons who were, are or are threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding because the person is or was our director, officer, employee or agent, if we determine that the person:\n\u25cf conducted himself or herself in good faith, reasonably believed, in the case of conduct in his or her official capacity as our director or officer, that his or her conduct was in our best interests, and, in all other cases, that his or her conduct was at least not opposed to our best interests; and\n\u25cf in the case of any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.\nThese persons may be indemnified against expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees, judgments, fines, including excise taxes, and amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the proceeding. If the person is found liable to the corporation, no indemnification will be made unless the court in which the action was brought determines that the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity in an amount that the court will establish.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us under the above provisions, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention, which may divert from our business operations.\nFollowing consummation of our initial public offering, we became subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements, and other information. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that material information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. We will need to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other financial personnel in order to enhance appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures. As a result, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. Furthermore, the need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management\u2019s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. In addition, we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur in order to comply with these requirements. We anticipate that these costs will materially increase our selling, general and administrative expenses.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In connection with the implementation of the necessary procedures and practices related to internal control over financial reporting, we may identify deficiencies. Additionally, in the event we are no longer a smaller reporting company, as defined under the Exchange Act, and we are unable to comply with the internal controls requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, then we may not be able to obtain the independent registered public accountants\u2019 certifications required by that act, which may preclude us from keeping our filings with the SEC current, and interfere with the ability of investors to trade our securities and our shares to continue to be listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. With each prospective acquisition we may make we will conduct whatever due diligence is necessary or prudent to assure us that the acquisition target can comply with the internal controls requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Notwithstanding our diligence, certain internal controls deficiencies may not be detected. As a result, any internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and access to capital. We have not performed an in-depth analysis to determine if historical undiscovered failures of internal controls exist, and may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement.\nPublic company compliance may make it more difficult to attract and retain officers and directors.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules implemented by the SEC have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. As a public company, these rules and regulations increase our compliance costs and make certain activities more time consuming and costly. As a public company, these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and expensive for us to maintain our director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers, and to maintain insurance at reasonable rates, or at all.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf our ability to execute our business plan and complete prospective acquisitions;\n\u25cf changes in our industry;\n\u25cf competitive pricing pressures;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain working capital financing;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf limited \u201cpublic float\u201d in the hands of a small number of persons whose sales or lack of sales could result in positive or negative pricing pressure on the market price for our common stock;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock (particularly following effectiveness of this registration statement);\n\u25cf operating results that fall below expectations;\n\u25cf regulatory developments;\n\u25cf economic and other external factors;\n\u25cf period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u25cf our inability to develop or acquire new or needed technologies;\n\u25cf the public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;\n\u25cf the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock; and\n\u25cf any future sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur shares of common stock may be thinly traded, and the price may not reflect our value, and there can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future.\nOur shares of common stock are thinly traded, our common stock is available to be traded and is held by a small number of holders, and the price may not reflect our actual or perceived value. There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. The market liquidity will be dependent on the perception of our operating business, among other things. We will take certain steps including utilizing investor awareness campaigns, investor relations firms, press releases, road shows and conferences to increase awareness of our business. Any steps that we might take to bring us to the awareness of investors may require that we compensate consultants with cash and/or stock. There can be no assurance that there will be any awareness generated or the results of any efforts will result in any impact on our trading volume. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business, and trading may be at an inflated price relative to the performance of the Company due to, among other things, the availability of sellers of our shares. If an active market should develop, the price may be highly volatile. Because there is currently a relatively low per-share price for our common stock, many brokerage firms or clearing firms are not willing to effect transactions in the securities or accept our shares for deposit in an account. Many lending institutions will not permit the use of low priced shares of common stock as collateral for any loans.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market upon the expiration of any statutory holding period under Rule 144, or shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an \u201coverhang\u201d and, in anticipation of which, the market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nIn general, a non-affiliated person who has held restricted shares for a period of six months, under Rule 144, may sell into the market our common stock all of their shares, subject to the Company being current in its periodic reports filed with the SEC. As of March 20, 2018, approximately 9,316,320 shares of common stock of the 9,339,291 shares outstanding were free trading.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares.\nIn addition, as of March 20, 2018, there were 8,302,590 shares subject to outstanding warrants, 8,322 shares subject to outstanding options under the plan, 1,389 shares subject to options not under the plan, 630,139 shares issuable upon the conversion of the November Note, 4,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance to investor relations firms, an additional 97,284 shares reserved for future issuance under our Amended and Restated 2011 Employee Stock Incentive Plan and up to an additional 2,000,000 shares of common stock which may be issued under the Company\u2019s 2018 Employee Stock Incentive Plan that will become, or have already become, eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by any applicable vesting requirements, the lock-up agreements and Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nOur common stock may be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market if we cannot satisfy Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements in the future.\nOn May 19, 2017, we received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff of Nasdaq notifying us that we no longer comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) due to our failure to maintain a minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders\u2019 equity (the \u201cMinimum Stockholders\u2019 Equity Requirement\u201d) or any alternatives to such requirement.\nOn October 24, 2017, the Company received notification (the \u201cStaff Delisting Determination\u201d) from Nasdaq that it has not regained compliance with the Minimum Stockholders\u2019 Equity Requirement. The Company appealed the Staff Delisting Determination and requested a hearing that was held on December 7, 2017. As a result, the suspension and delisting was stayed pending the issuance of a written decision by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \u201cPanel\u201d).\nBy decision dated December 14, 2017, the Panel granted the Company\u2019s request for a further extension, through April 23, 2018, to evidence compliance with the $2,500,000 stockholders\u2019 equity requirement. The Company\u2019s continued listing on Nasdaq through April 23, 2018 and thereafter is subject to the Company\u2019s compliance with certain interim milestones, which, if not timely satisfied, may result in the delisting of the Company\u2019s common stock from Nasdaq.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had a stockholder\u2019s deficit equal to $18,853,000 and therefore, were not compliant with the stockholder\u2019s equity requirement as of such date. While we are pursuing actions to cure the deficiency including, but not limited to a possible sale or divesture of our Infrastructure segment, there are no assurances that any such transaction will be consummated. If we are unable to complete such transactions or otherwise comply with the Minimum Stockholders\u2019 Equity Requirement by April 23, 2018, our common stock may be delisted, which could make trading our common stock more difficult for investors, potentially leading to declines in our share price and liquidity. Without a Nasdaq listing, stockholders may have a difficult time getting a quote for the sale or purchase of our stock, the sale or purchase of our stock would likely be made more difficult and the trading volume and liquidity of our stock could decline. Delisting from Nasdaq could also result in negative publicity and could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. Further, if we are delisted, we would also incur additional costs under state blue sky laws in connection with any sales of our securities. These requirements could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock in the secondary market. If our common stock is delisted by Nasdaq, our common stock may be eligible to trade on an over-the-counter quotation system, such as the OTCQB market, where an investor may find it more difficult to sell our stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. We cannot assure you that our common stock, if delisted from Nasdaq, will be listed on another national securities exchange or quoted on an over-the counter quotation system.\nOn August 14, 2017, we received a deficiency letter from Nasdaq indicating that, based on our closing bid price for the last 30 consecutive business days, we do not comply with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we had a grace period of 180 calendar days, or until February 12, 2018, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement for continued listing. We effected a 1-for-30 reverse stock split on February 6, 2018 in response to our non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement and as of the date of this filing we have achieved compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, however, there are no assurances that we will be able to continue to maintain such compliance.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are generally not restricted from issuing additional common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of common stock or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive common stock or the perception that such sales could occur.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our common stock or if they issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nRisks Related to the Divestiture\nThe proposed divestiture of our VAR business may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms, or at all, may be more expensive than anticipated and may not achieve the intended benefits.\nWe are currently contemplating a divestiture of our VAR business via our wholly-owned subsidiary, Inpixon USA. The separation is subject to final board approval of the terms of such transaction, SEC clearance, market and certain other conditions, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when such a transaction will occur. Unforeseen developments, including possible delays in obtaining various tax and regulatory approvals or clearances, could delay or prevent the proposed separation or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable and/or different than expected. We expect the process of completing such transaction will be time-consuming and involve significant costs and expenses, which may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate, may increase in the event that the timing of the transaction is delayed and may not yield a benefit if the transaction is not completed. Executing the proposed transaction, as well as performing our obligations under any transition services agreement entered into with Inpixon USA for a period of time after the separation, will require significant time and attention from our senior management and employees, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and results of operations.\nSeparating the businesses may also result in dis-synergies post-separation that could negatively impact the balance sheet, income statement and cash flows of each business. Moreover, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational, marketing or other benefits from the Inpixon USA. As independent companies, Inpixon and Inpixon USA would each be smaller, less diversified companies with narrower business focuses and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could materially and adversely affect their respective businesses, financial condition and results of operations and lead to increased volatility in the price of our common stock. In addition, there can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two companies would be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred.\nIf the divestiture is structured as a spin-off and does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Inpixon, Inpixon USA and Inpixon stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities.\nIn order for a spin-off transaction to be classified as tax-free it must comply with several statutory and non-statutory requirements of Section 355 of the Code and the corresponding Treasury Regulations. These requirements include, among other things: proof of control by Inpixon of Inpixon USA, an active trade or business in both entities for a specified period of time, evidence that the transaction is not merely a device for the distribution of earnings and profits of either entity and a distribution by Inpixon of all of its securities of Inpixon USA held immediately prior to the transaction. If the spin-off, together with certain related transactions, fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, Inpixon would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the Inpixon USA common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and Inpixon stockholders who receive Inpixon USA shares in the spin-off may be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.\nWhile we may seek indemnification from Inpixon USA in the event that any taxes are incurred by us (or any related costs or damages) as a result of the spin-off to the extent any such obligations result from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of Inpixon USA, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether Inpixon USA participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (ii) other actions or failures to act by Inpixon USA or (iii) any of the representations or undertaking of Inpixon USA contained in any of the spin-off-related agreements being incorrect or violated, there are no assurances that we will obtain such indemnifications. In addition, we may be required to indemnify Inpixon USA to the extent that it incurs any taxes as a result of Inpixon consummating a transaction similar to the ones described above. As a result, any resulting tax obligations incurred by us or Inpixon USA for which we may be required to indemnify it for could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company and Inpixon USA may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capital-raising transactions following the separation.\nUnder current law, a spin-off can be rendered taxable to the parent corporation and its stockholders as a result of certain post-spin-off acquisitions of shares or assets of the spun-off corporation or any other controlled corporation. For example, a spin-off may result in taxable gain to the parent corporation under Section 355(e) of the Code if the spin-off were later deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, shares representing a 50% or greater interest (by vote or value) in the spun-off corporation. As a result, if the divestiture is structured as a spin-off in order to preserve the tax-free treatment of the separation and the distribution, we and Inpixon USA may be restricted from (i) entering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of the shares of our common stock would be acquired, whether by merger or otherwise, (ii) issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, (iii) repurchasing shares of our common stock other than in certain open-market transactions, or (iv) ceasing to actively conduct certain of our businesses. As a result, these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions, equity issuances or repurchases or other transactions that we believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business.\nIf the divestiture is structured as a spin-off, certain members of management and directors may hold stock in both Inpixon and Inpixon USA, and as a result may face actual or potential conflicts of interest.\nIf the divestiture is structured as a spin-off, certain of the management and directors of each of Inpixon and Inpixon USA may own both Inpixon common stock and Inpixon USA common stock. This ownership overlap could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when Inpixon USA management and directors and Inpixon\u2019s management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for Inpixon USA and Inpixon. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between Inpixon USA and Inpixon regarding the terms of the agreements governing the spin-off and Inpixon USA relationship with Inpixon thereafter. Potential conflicts of interest may also arise out of any commercial arrangements that Inpixon USA or Inpixon may enter into in the future.", "PERMNO": 14610, "SIC": 5045, "TIC": "INPX"}
