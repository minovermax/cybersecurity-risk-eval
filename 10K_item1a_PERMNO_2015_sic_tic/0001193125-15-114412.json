{"cik": "1109196", "company": "MABVAX THERAPEUTICS HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business faces significant risks, some of which are set forth below to enable readers to assess, and be appropriately apprised of, many of the risks and uncertainties applicable to the forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report. You should carefully consider these risk factors as each of these risks could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs, our business may suffer, the trading price of our common stock could decline and our financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. These risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this Annual Report. There may be additional risks faced by our business, though we do believe that the risks set forth below reflect the more important ones.\nWe will be required to raise additional funds to finance our operations and remain a going concern; we may not be able to do so when necessary, and/or the terms of any financings may not be advantageous to us.\nOur operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash. Negative cash flows from our operations are expected to continue over at least the next several years. Our cash utilization amount is highly dependent on the progress of our product development programs, particularly, the results of our preclinical and clinical studies and those of our partners, the cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory approval for our product candidates, and the rate of recruitment of patients in our human clinical trials. In addition, the further development of our ongoing clinical trials will depend on upcoming analysis and results of those studies and our financial resources at that time.\nWe are aggressively pursuing forms of capital infusion including public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements with organizations that have capabilities and/or products that are complementary to our own capabilities and/or products, in order to continue the development of our product candidates. However, there can be no assurances that we will complete any financings, strategic alliances or collaborative development agreements, and the terms of such arrangements may not be advantageous to us.\nOur ongoing capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including: the progress and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates under development; the costs of complying with the FDA and other domestic and foreign regulatory agency requirements, the progress of our research and development programs and those of our partners; the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals; the resources that we devote to manufacturing expenditures; our ability to enter into licensing arrangements, including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and clinical trial programs; the costs and expenses of filing, prosecuting and, if necessary, enforcing our patent claims, or defending against possible claims of infringement by third-party patent or other technology rights; the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements, if any, that we undertake; and, if and when approved, the demand for our products, which demand depends in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known, understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval, including the range of indications for which any product is granted approval.\nWe anticipate that we will need to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements. As further discussed below with respect to risks related to ownership of our capital stock, any additional equity financing will be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. If we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish, on terms that are not favorable to us, rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize. Our failure to raise capital when needed could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a history of losses, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future; our auditors have included in their audit report an explanatory paragraph as to substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have experienced net losses every year since our inception and, as of December 31, 2014, had an accumulated deficit of $24,550,308. Our auditors have included in their audit report a \u201cgoing concern\u201d explanatory paragraph as to substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern that assumes the realization of our assets and the satisfaction of our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. We anticipate continuing to incur substantial additional losses over at least the next several years due to, among other factors, expenses related to the following: the GMP manufacture of our 5B1 antibody to create clinical trial supplies, conducting Phase I clinical trials with the 5B1 antibody, preclinical testing of follow-on antibody candidates, investor and public relations, SEC compliance efforts, anticipated research and development activities and the general and administrative expenses associated with each of these activities. We have not yet commercialized any product candidates. Our ability to attain profitability will depend upon our ability to develop and commercialize products that are effective and commercially viable, to obtain regulatory approval for the manufacture and sale of our products and to license or otherwise market our products successfully. We may never achieve profitability, and even if we do, we may not be able to sustain being profitable.\nIf we are unable to obtain required regulatory approvals, we will be unable to market and sell our product candidates.\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to development, clinical trials, manufacturing, oversight of clinical investigators, recordkeeping and commercialization. Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory review and approval process are required to be successfully completed in the United States and in each foreign jurisdiction in which we offer our products before a new drug or other product can be sold in such jurisdictions. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain, and subject to unanticipated delays. The time required to obtain approval by the FDA, or the regulatory authority in such other jurisdictions is unpredictable and often exceeds five years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the complexity of the product candidate and the requirements of the applicable regulatory agency.\nIn connection with the clinical development of our product candidates, we face risks that:\n\u2022\nthe product candidate may not prove to be safe and efficacious;\n\u2022\npatients may die or suffer serious adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to the product candidate being tested;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to maintain adequate records of observations and data from our clinical trials, to establish and maintain sufficient procedures to oversee, collect data from, and manage clinical trials, or to monitor clinical trial sites and investigators to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory agencies;\n\u2022\nthe results of later-phase clinical trials may not confirm the results of earlier clinical trials; and\n\u2022\nthe results from clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance or clinical benefit-to-risk ratio required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for marketing approval.\nOnly a small percentage of product candidates for which clinical trials are initiated receive approval for commercialization. Furthermore, even if we do receive regulatory approval to market a product candidate, any such approval may be subject to limitations such as those on the indicated uses for which we may market a particular product candidate.\nOur product candidates have not completed clinical trials, and may never demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in order to do so.\nOur product candidates are in the clinical and pre-clinical stages of development. In order to achieve profitable operations, we alone, or in collaboration with others, must successfully develop, manufacture, introduce and market our products. The time frame necessary to achieve market success for any individual product is long and uncertain. The products we are currently developing will require significant additional research, development and preclinical and clinical testing prior to application for commercial use or sale. A number of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after showing promising results in early or later-stage studies or clinical trials. Although we have obtained some favorable results to-date in preclinical studies and clinical trials of certain of our potential products, such results may not be indicative of results that will ultimately be obtained in or throughout such clinical trials, and clinical trials may not show any of our products to be safe or capable of producing a desired result. Additionally, we may encounter problems in our clinical trials that may cause us to delay, suspend or terminate those clinical trials.\nFurther, our research or product development efforts may not be successfully completed, any compounds we currently have under development may not be successfully developed into drugs, may not receive regulatory approval on a timely basis, if at all, and competitors may develop and bring to market products or technologies that render our potential products obsolete. If any of these events occur, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nIf clinical trials or regulatory approval processes for our product candidates are prolonged, delayed or suspended, we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis, which would require us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt of any revenue from potential product sales.\nWe cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or any regulatory authority to delay or suspend those clinical trials or delay the analysis of data derived from them. A number of events, including any of the following, could delay the completion of our ongoing and planned clinical trials and negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and to market and sell, a particular product candidate:\n\u2022\nconditions imposed on us by the FDA or another foreign regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining, or our inability to obtain, required approvals from institutional review boards or other reviewing entities at clinical sites selected for participation in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninsufficient supply of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct and complete our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nslow enrollment and retention rate of subjects in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nserious and unexpected drug-related side effects related to the product candidate being tested; and\n\u2022\ndelays in meeting manufacturing and testing standards required for production of clinical trial supplies.\nCommercialization of our product candidates may be delayed by the imposition of additional conditions on our clinical trials by the FDA or any other applicable foreign regulatory authority or the requirement of additional supportive studies by the FDA or such foreign regulatory authority. In addition, clinical trials require sufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the\navailability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, the conduct of other clinical trials that compete for the same patients as our clinical trials, and the eligibility criteria for our clinical trials. Our failure to enroll patients in our clinical trials could delay the completion of the clinical trial beyond its expectations. In addition, the FDA could require us to conduct clinical trials with a larger number of subjects than we may have projected for any of our product candidates. We may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in a timely or cost-effective manner. Furthermore, enrolled patients may drop out of our clinical trials, which could impair the validity or statistical significance of the clinical trials.\nWe do not know whether our clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured, or will be completed on schedule, if at all. Delays in our clinical trials will result in increased development costs for our product candidates, and our financial resources may be insufficient to fund any incremental costs. In addition, if our clinical trials are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be limited.\nOur product candidates will remain subject to ongoing regulatory review even if they receive marketing approval, and if we fail to comply with continuing regulations, we could lose these approvals and the sale of any of our approved commercial products could be suspended.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, and record keeping related to the product will remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA and other applicable domestic and foreign regulatory authorities or discover any previously unknown problems with any approved product, manufacturer, or manufacturing process, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the products, manufacturers, or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nwarning letters;\n\u2022\ncivil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nfines;\n\u2022\ninjunctions;\n\u2022\nproduct seizures or detentions;\n\u2022\npressure to initiate voluntary product recalls;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals; and\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products or supplements to approved applications.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and our product candidates may become obsolete.\nWe are engaged in a rapidly evolving field. Competition from other pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and research and academic institutions is intense and likely to increase. Many of those companies and institutions have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Those companies and institutions also have substantially greater experience in developing products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval and in manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. Our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do. Competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are, or in the future may be, the basis for competitive products. We are aware of potential competitors developing products similar to our sarcoma vaccine, ovarian cancer vaccine and pancreatic cancer antibodies product candidates. Our competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective and/or cost competitive than those we are developing, or that would render our product candidates less competitive or even obsolete. In addition, one or more of our competitors may achieve product commercialization or patent protection earlier than we do, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf physicians and patients do not accept our future products or if the market for indications for which any product candidate is approved is smaller than expected, we may be unable to generate significant revenue, if any.\nEven if any of our product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, and third-party payers. Physicians may decide not to recommend our treatments for a variety of reasons including:\n\u2022\ntiming of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u2022\ndemonstration of clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products;\n\u2022\ncost-effectiveness;\n\u2022\nlimited or no coverage by third-party payers;\n\u2022\nconvenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u2022\nrestrictions in the label of the drug;\n\u2022\nother potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; and\n\u2022\nineffective marketing and distribution support of its products.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved, but fail to achieve market acceptance or such market is smaller than anticipated, we may not be able to generate significant revenue and our business would suffer.\nAs we evolve from a company that is primarily involved in clinical development to a company that is also involved in commercialization, we may encounter difficulties in expanding our operations successfully.\nAs we advance our product candidates through clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities and may need to further contract with third parties to provide these capabilities. As our operations expand, we likely will need to manage additional relationships with such third parties, as well as additional collaborators, distributors, marketers and suppliers.\nMaintaining third party relationships for these purposes will impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management and other personnel. We must be able to: manage our development efforts effectively; recruit and train sales and marketing personnel; manage our participation in the clinical trials in which our product candidates are involved effectively; and improve our managerial, development, operational and finance systems, all of which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure.\nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing or distribution services, any product revenues that we receive, or the profitability of these product revenues to us, are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop without the involvement of these third parties. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our products or in doing so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our products.\nThe uncertainty associated with pharmaceutical reimbursement and related matters may adversely affect our business.\nMarket acceptance and sales of any one or more of our product candidates will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will cover and establish payment levels. We cannot be certain that reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates. Also, we cannot be certain that reimbursement policies will not reduce the demand for, or the price paid for, our products. If reimbursement is not available or is available on a limited basis, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidates that we develop.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation established Medicare Part D, which expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drug purchases by the elderly but provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. The MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs.\nThe United States and several foreign jurisdictions are considering, or have already enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access to healthcare. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any products that it develops due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, ACA, became law in the U.S. The goal of ACA is to reduce the cost of health care and substantially change the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers. While we cannot predict what impact on federal reimbursement policies this legislation will have in general or on our business specifically, the ACA may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of, and the price we charge for, any products we develop that receive regulatory approval. We also cannot predict the impact of ACA on our business, as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions, which have not yet been fully promulgated and implemented.\nWe only have a limited number of employees to manage and operate our business.\nAs of March 31, 2015, we had a total of 12 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees. Our focus on limiting cash utilization requires us to manage and operate our business in a highly efficient manner. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish.\nWe depend heavily on our executive officers, directors, and principal consultants and the loss of their services would materially harm our business.\nWe believe that our success depends, and will likely continue to depend, upon our ability to retain the services of our current executive officers, directors, principal consultants and others. In addition, we have established relationships with universities, hospitals and research institutions, which have historically provided, and continue to provide, us with access to research laboratories, clinical trials, facilities and patients. The loss of the services of any of these individuals or institutions would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDue in part to our limited financial resources, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates or those that are in-licensed, and/or we may be unable to pursue the clinical trials that we would like to pursue.\nWe have limited technical, managerial and financial resources to determine the indications on which we should focus the development efforts related to our product candidates. Due to our limited available financial resources, we may have curtailed clinical development programs and activities that might otherwise have led to more rapid progress of our product candidates through the regulatory and development processes.\nWe may make incorrect determinations with regard to the indications and clinical trials on which to focus the available resources that we do have. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish. Our decisions to allocate our research, management and financial resources toward particular indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better opportunities. Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate drug development programs may also cause us to miss valuable opportunities.\nIf the third parties on which we rely for the conduct of our clinical trials and results do not perform our clinical trial activities in accordance with good clinical practices and related regulatory requirements, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe use independent clinical investigators and other third-party service providers to conduct and/or oversee the clinical trials of our product candidates and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials. Nonetheless, we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the FDA\u2019s requirements and our general investigational plan and protocol.\nThe FDA requires us and our clinical investigators to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting and recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or the respective trial plans and protocols. The failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations could delay or prevent the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates or result in enforcement action against us.\nWe have limited manufacturing capacity and have relied on, and expect to continue to rely on, third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates, and we lack the resources and the capabilities to do so. As a result, we currently rely, and expect to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party manufacturers to supply our product candidates. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our product candidates or products ourselves, including:\n\u2022\nreliance on third-parties for manufacturing process development, regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022\nlimitations on supply availability resulting from capacity and scheduling constraints of third-parties;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of manufacturing agreements by third-parties because of factors beyond our control; and\n\u2022\nthe possible termination or non-renewal of the manufacturing agreements by the third-party, at a time that is costly or inconvenient to us.\nIf we do not maintain our key manufacturing relationships, we may fail to find replacement manufacturers or develop our own manufacturing capabilities, which could delay or impair our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products and substantially increases our costs or deplete profit margins, if any. If we do find replacement manufacturers, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us and there could be a substantial delay before new facilities could be qualified and registered with the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities.\nThe FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities require manufacturers to register manufacturing facilities. The FDA and corresponding foreign regulators also inspect these facilities to confirm compliance with current cGMPs. Contract manufacturers may face manufacturing or quality control problems causing drug substance production and shipment delays or a situation where the contractor may not be able to maintain compliance with the applicable cGMP requirements. Any failure to comply with cGMP requirements or other FDA, EMA and comparable foreign regulatory requirements could adversely affect our clinical research activities and our ability to develop our product candidates and market our products following approval.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop our product candidates and commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval on a timely basis.\nWe depend extensively on our patents and proprietary technology and the patents and proprietary technology we license from others, and we must protect those assets in order to preserve our business.\nAlthough we expect to seek patent protection for any compounds we discover and/or for any specific use we discover for new or previously known compounds, any or all of such compounds or new uses may not be subject to effective patent protection. Further, the development of regimens for the administration of our vaccines, which involve specifications for the frequency, timing and amount of dosages, has been, and we believe may continue to be, important to our efforts, although those processes, as such, may not be patentable. In addition, our issued patents may be declared invalid or our competitors may find ways to avoid the claims in the patents.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, protect our trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. As of February 6, 2015, we were the exclusive licensee, sole assignee or co-assignee of 20 granted United States patents, 16 pending United States patent applications and 41 international patents through MabVax Therapeutics, and 21granted United States patents, 12 pending United States patent applications and 99 international patents obtained and 88 international patent applications are being maintained by the Company from prior to the Merger while we continue to evaluate the usefulness to the Company. The patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms like us are generally highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions, resulting in both an apparent inconsistency regarding the breadth of claims allowed in United States patents and general uncertainty as to their legal interpretation and enforceability. Accordingly, patent applications assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not result in patents being issued, any issued patents assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not provide us with competitive protection or may be challenged by others, and the current or future granted patents of others may have an adverse effect on our ability to do business and achieve profitability. Moreover, because some of the basic research relating to one or more of our patent applications and/or patents were performed at various universities and/or funded by grants, one or more universities, employees of such universities and/or grantors could assert that they have certain rights in such research and any resulting products. Further, others may independently develop similar products, may\nduplicate our products, or may design around our patent rights. In addition, as a result of the assertion of rights by a third-party or otherwise, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of others in or outside of the United States. Any licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights may not be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we do not obtain such licenses, we could encounter delays in product market introductions during our attempts to design around such patents or could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses is foreclosed. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending suits brought against us or in connection with patents to which we hold licenses or in bringing suit to protect our own patents against infringement.\nWe require employees and the institutions that perform our preclinical and clinical trials to enter into confidentiality agreements with us. Those agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to a party to any such agreement during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third-parties, except in specific circumstances. Any such agreement may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.\nWith respect to our vaccine programs we have licensed in rights to antibody programs and other programs from third parties. If these license agreements terminate or expire, we may lose the licensed rights to some or all of our product candidates. We may not be able to continue to develop them or, if they are approved, market or commercialize them.\nWe depend on license agreements with third-parties for certain intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates, including, but not limited to, the license of certain intellectual property rights from MSKCC. In general, our license agreements require us to make payments and satisfy performance obligations in order to keep these agreements in effect and retain our rights under them. These payment obligations can include upfront fees, maintenance fees, milestones, royalties, patent prosecution expenses, and other fees. These performance obligations typically include diligence obligations. If we fail to pay, be diligent or otherwise perform as required under our license agreements, we could lose the rights under the patents and other intellectual property rights covered by these agreements. If disputes arise under any of our in-licenses, including our in-licenses from MSKCC, we could lose our rights under these agreements. Any such dispute may not be resolvable on favorable terms, or at all. Whether or not any disputes of this kind are favorably resolved, our management\u2019s time and attention and our other resources could be consumed by the need to attend to these disputes and our business could be harmed by the emergence of such a dispute.\nIf we lose our rights under these agreements, we might not be able to develop any related product candidates further, or following regulatory approval, if any, we might be prohibited from marketing or commercializing these product candidates. In particular, patents previously licensed to us might, after termination of an agreement, be used to stop us from conducting these activities.\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates and any products that we may develop.\nThe testing and marketing of medical products entail an inherent risk of product liability. Although we are not aware of any historical or anticipated product liability claims or specific causes for concern, if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates and any products that we may develop. In addition, product liability claims may also result in withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers, injury to our reputation and decreased demand for any products that we may commercialize. We currently carry product liability insurance that covers our clinical trials up to a $10.0 million annual aggregate limit. We will need to increase the amount of coverage if and when we have a product that is commercially available. If we are unable to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost, potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of any products that we may develop, alone or with corporate partners.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law could deter a change of our management which could discourage or delay offers to acquire us.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and of our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated by-laws, could discourage or make it more difficult to accomplish a proxy contest or other change in our management or the acquisition of control by a holder of a substantial amount of our voting stock. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish, or could deter, transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interests or in our best interests. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nestablishing a classified board of directors requiring that members of the board be elected in different years, which lengthens the time needed to elect a new majority of the board;\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares or change the balance of voting control and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow for less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of the stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent and requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nestablishing 90 to 120 day advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nThe price of our common stock is volatile, and is likely to continue to fluctuate due to reasons beyond our control.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and likely will continue to be, highly volatile. Factors, including our financial results or our competitors\u2019 financial results, clinical trial and research development announcements and government regulatory action affecting our potential products in both the United States and foreign countries, have had, and may continue to have, a significant effect on our results of operations and on the market price of our common stock. We cannot assure you that any investment in our common stock will not fluctuate significantly. One or more of these factors could significantly harm our business and cause a decline in the price of our common stock in the public market. Sales of shares of common stock registered for resale or eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act as amended, as well as future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders, or the perception that sales may occur at any time, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSubstantial future sales of our common stock by us or by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall.\nAdditional equity financings or other share issuances by us, including shares issued in connection with strategic alliances and corporate partnering transactions, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Sales by existing stockholders of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that additional sales could occur could cause the market price of our common stock to drop. Substantially all of our outstanding shares of common stock were freely tradable and, in limited cases, subject to certain volume, notice and manner of sale restrictions under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933.\nIf we do not progress in our programs as anticipated, our stock price could decrease.\nFor planning purposes, we estimate the timing of a variety of clinical, regulatory and other milestones, such as when a certain product candidate will enter clinical development, when a clinical trial will be completed or when an application for regulatory approval will be filed. Our estimates are based on present facts and a variety of assumptions. Many of the underlying assumptions are outside of our control. If milestones are not achieved when we estimated that they would be, investors could be disappointed, and our stock price may decrease.\nOur stock price may be volatile, you may not be able to resell your shares at or above your purchase price.\nOur stock prices and the market prices for securities of biotechnology companies in general have been highly volatile, with recent significant price and volume fluctuations, and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2014, our common stock traded between $1.51 per share and $16.48 per share. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022\ndevelopments regarding, or the results of, our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new commercial products by our competitors or us;\n\u2022\nour issuance of equity or debt securities, or disclosure or announcements relating thereto;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning proprietary rights, including patents;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning our collaborations;\n\u2022\npublicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under development by our competitors or us;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022\nlitigation;\n\u2022\neconomic and other external factors or other disaster or crisis; or\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nWe have been, and in the future may be, subject to securities class action lawsuits and shareholder derivative actions. These, and potential similar or related litigation, could result in substantial damages and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business.\nWe have been, and may in the future be, the target of securities class actions or shareholder derivative claims. Any such actions or claims could result in substantial damages and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business.\nThe rights of our common stockholders are limited by and subordinate to the rights of the holders of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock; these rights may have a negative effect on the value of shares of our common stock.\nThe holders of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock have rights and preferences generally superior to those of the holders of common stock. The existence of these superior rights and preferences may have a negative effect on the value of shares of our common stock. These rights are more fully set forth in the Series A-1 certificate of designations and Series B certificate of designations, respectively, and include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe right to receive a liquidation preference, prior to any distribution of our assets to the holders of our common stock, in an amount equal to $ 1.676708000 per share for the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and $2.00 per share for the Series B Preferred Stock, as of December 31, 2014, subject to adjustments, and all accrued and unpaid dividends;\n\u2022\nthe right to convert into shares of our common stock at the conversion price set forth in the Series A-1 certificate of designations and Series B certificate of designations, respectively, which may be adjusted as set forth therein; and\n\u2022\nthe right to receive dividends in arrears at a rate of 8% per annum in preference to the holders of our common stock and to receive dividends made to holders of our common stock on an as converted basis.\nThe holders of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock have the right to block certain fundamental transactions as further described in the Series A-1 certificate of designations and Series B certificate of designations, respectively; these holders may use this right to negotiate terms more favorable to the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock to the detriment of the holders of other classes of our capital stock or may prevent us from completing transactions favorable to us and the holders of other classes of our capital stock.\nAs further set forth in the Series A-1 certificate of designations, the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding Series A-1 convertible preferred stock, Series B convertible preferred stock or Hudson Bay Opportunities Fund LP and/or its affiliates, or Hudson Bay, have the right to approve or block certain transactions, including transactions that:\n\u2022\ncreate or issue additional or other capital stock or securities exchangeable for or convertible or exercisable into capital stock pari passu with or senior to the Series A-1 convertible preferred stock or Series B convertible preferred stock;\n\u2022\nreclassify, alter or amend any of our existing securities that are pari passu with the Series A-1 Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock;\n\u2022\nchange the authorized number of shares of our capital stock;\n\u2022\ncreate or issue debt securities;\n\u2022\nauthorize or effect payment of dividends or distributions on our capital stock;\n\u2022\nauthorize or effect change of control, dissolution or liquidation events;\n\u2022\namend or repeal our certificate of incorporation or bylaws;\n\u2022\namend, alter or repeal preferences, special rights or other powers of the Series A-1 convertible preferred stock or Series B convertible preferred stock;\n\u2022\navoid the observance or performance of the terms of the Series A-1 or Series B certificates of designations; and\n\u2022\neffect any change in our principal business.\nHudson Bay and/or the Series A-1 convertible preferred stockholders and/or the Series B convertible preferred stockholders may have interests differing from or detrimental to other holders of other classes of our capital stock with respect to these fundamental transactions. Obtaining the consent of these holders may delay or limit our ability to enter into transactions that may be beneficial to the holders of other classes of our capital stock.\nA limited public trading market may cause volatility in the price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB marketplace. The quotation of our common stock on the OTCQB marketplace does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market currently exists, and in recent years such market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many smaller companies like us. Our common stock is subject to this volatility. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock and our stock price may decline substantially in a short time and our stockholders could suffer losses or be unable to liquidate their holdings. Because our common stock does not trade on a national securities exchange, our common stock is subject to the securities laws of the various states and jurisdictions of the United States in addition to federal securities law. While we may register our common stock or qualify for exemptions for our common stock in one of more states, if we fail to do so the investors in those states where we have not taken such steps may not be allowed to purchase our stock or those who presently hold our stock may not be able to resell their shares without substantial effort and expense. These restrictions and potential costs could be significant burdens on our stockholders.\nThe floating conversion price for our Series B Preferred Stock may lead to significant shareholder dilution and a corresponding drop in the market price of our common stock.\nAs described above and in the Series B certificate of designations, our Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into our common stock at a \u201cfloating\u201d conversion price. Following the Adjustment Date (as defined in the Series B certificate of designations), this conversion price adjusts according to the market price of our common stock. If the market price of our common stock declines, shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be convertible into a greater number of shares of common stock, which could have the effect of diluting the ownership interest of all other holders of our common stock. If the market price of our common stock were to decline significantly, this dilution could be substantial. Furthermore, any such dilution may cause the market price of the common stock to decline further, resulting in additional dilution and a continued potential adverse effect on the common stock price thereafter and could result in an imbalance of supply and demand for our common stock and reduce its price. This series of events could lead to a repetitive cycle, further and successively driving the market price of our common stock downward. The further the market price of our common stock declines, the further the floating conversion price will fall and the greater the number of shares we will have to issue upon conversion. In addition to affecting the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of each share of common stock for existing shareholders, the floating conversion price and the effects that it may have may also make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future, which could adversely affect our ability to operate or grow our business.\nWe may not be able to achieve secondary trading of our stock in certain states because our common stock is no longer nationally traded, which could subject our stockholders to significant restrictions and costs.\nOur common stock is not currently eligible for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market or on a national securities exchange. Therefore, our common stock is subject to the securities laws of the various states and jurisdictions of the United States in addition to federal securities law. While we may register our common stock or qualify for exemptions for our common stock in one of more states, if we fail to do so the investors in those states where we have not taken such steps may not be allowed to purchase our stock or those who presently hold our stock may not be able to resell their shares without substantial effort and expense. These restrictions and potential costs could be significant burdens on our stockholders.\nOur management and our independent registered public accounting firm identified certain material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting upon completion of our audit in May of 2014 that were not fully remediated as of December 31, 2014. While we have implemented certain internal controls to eliminate material weaknesses, if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements, and our independent registered public accounting firm could conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective, which could adversely impact investor confidence and our stock price.\nIn connection with the audit of MabVax Therapeutics\u2019 financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, MabVax Therapeutics management and its independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting relating to the reporting of non-routine complex transactions and the lack of segregation of\nduties. These material weaknesses were primarily the result of a limited number of employees in the accounting department at MabVax Therapeutics. In June 2014, MabVax Therapeutics added an assistant controller, a person dedicated solely to processing accounts payable, and another person dedicated to reviewing and reporting on clinical trials progress and expenses. These persons have continued to work in these capacities following the Merger. On March 25, 2015 we filed with the SEC an amended quarterly report for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, to correct certain errors in our financial statements for that period, namely an error in accounting for employee severance expense relative to the July 2014 Merger. Additional errors may occur if we are not able to eliminate the material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. Our management is responsible for maintaining, implementing and testing our internal controls over financial reporting. These efforts are intended to maintain an effective control environment but may not be sufficient to remediate any material weaknesses identified by our independent registered accounting firm and may not prevent significant deficiencies from occurring.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, such that there is reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by our employees. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. There are inherent limitations in all control systems and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and all instances of fraud will be detected. If management identifies future material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, if and when required, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the value of our capital stock could be negatively affected, and our could become subject to criminal and civil investigations by the stock exchange or marketplace on which our securities are then listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.", "PERMNO": 88572, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "MBVXQ"}
